      <title>Gliders on the Stranded Cellular Automata Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stranded Cellular Automata (SCA) model consists of a grid of cells which can each contain between zero and two strands apiece and two turning rules that control when strands turn and when they cross. While patterns on this model have been studied previously, such research has not needed an algebraic description of the model. We provide a formal algebraic definition of patterns on the model, define gliders on the model in a way which is semi-compatible with definitions of gliders in other cellular automata models, and classify all 1- and 2-stranded gliders on this model. In addition, we prove an equivalence of two classes of gliders and design an algorithm to generate all such elements of that class.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Newton's method for odd and even elliptic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Newton's method applied to any odd or any even elliptic function with an arbitrary period lattice. For any function of this type whose set of poles coincides with its period lattice, we show that the Julia set of its Newton map is connected, as long as no Herman rings exist. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions on the Newton's method of any odd or even elliptic function to exhibit wandering domains coexisting with attracting basins. This phenomenon was first reported by Florido and Fagella for the Newton's method applied to a family of entire functions; however, our approach does not employ the lifting technique. We also provide a detailed study of a one-parameter family of elliptic functions given by $\wp_\Lambda+b$ with $\Lambda$ any triangular period lattice and $b\in\mathbb{C}$. We show that their associated Newton maps do not exhibit Herman rings or Baker domains, and any other Fatou component, including wandering, is bounded.</description>

      <title>The full diapason of convergence rates of Birkhoff averages for ergodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ergodic flow, a range of rates of convergence of Birkhoff averages from the maximum rate to an arbitrarily slow rate is realized by choosing the averaging function. For torus windings, the continuity of the averaging functions is ensured. This complements Krengel's classical result on the slow rates of convergence of means for ergodic automorphisms.</description>

      <title>On transversely holomorphic partially hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic partially hyperbolic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove in the seven-dimensional case that under the assumption that the subcenter distribution is integrable to a flow invariant compact foliation with trivial holonomy, then the flow projects, by a smooth fiber bundle map, to a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth five-dimensional manifold which is, in case of topological transitivity, either $C^\infty$ orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of nontrivial stationary solution and constant equilibrium point of reaction-diffusion neural networks with time delays under Dirichlet zero boundary value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique, design of state-dependent switching laws, a fixed point theorem and variational methods are employed to derive the existence and the unique existence results of globally exponentially stable (positive) stationary solution of delayed reaction-diffusion cell neural networks under Dirichlet zero boundary value, including the global stability criteria in the classical meaning. Next, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the global stability invariance of ordinary differential systems under the influence of diffusions. New theorems show that the diffusion is a double-edged sword in judging the stability of diffusion systems. Besides, an example is constructed to illuminate that any non-zero constant equilibrium point must be not in the phase plane of dynamic system under Dirichlet zero boundary value, or it must lead to a contradiction. Next, under Lipschitz assumptions on active function, another example is designed to prove that the small diffusion effect will cause the essential change of the phase plane structure of the dynamic behavior of the delayed neural networks via a Saddle point theorem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility of the proposed methods. It is worth mentioning that some interesting mathematical problems are originally put forward in the last chapter.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Reservoir Computing for Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical computing exploits unconventional physical substrates to overcome limitations such as the high energy consumption inherent in digital computation. However, intrinsic noise and temporal fluctuations (e.g., oscillations) generally deteriorate computational performance. Here, we propose ensemble reservoir computing (ERC), a novel framework that employs ensemble averaging of spatially multiplexed systems to achieve robust information processing despite noise and temporal fluctuations. First, we prove that ensemble averaging in ERC eliminates temporal fluctuations and noise from dynamical states under certain conditions, thereby restoring computational performance to its noise-free level. Next, we show that ERC not only removes the noise and fluctuations but also actively exploits the computational capabilities that conventional reservoir computing (RC) leaves unutilized. This computational enhancement is demonstrated across diverse dynamical systems (e.g., periodic, chaotic, and strange-nonchaotic systems), in which ERC outperforms conventional RC. Finally, using energy-efficient spin-torque oscillators (STOs), we demonstrate that ERC maintains high performance even under realistic conditions, in which noise and temporal fluctuations coexist: STOs with ERC achieved 99\% accuracy on an error detection test, where conventional STO reservoir with linear regression only shows a chance level performance, highlighting ERC's robustness and performance gains for physical systems.</description>

      <title>Growth estimate for the number of crossing limit cycles in planar piecewise polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem, we extend some main developments obtained for Hilbert's number in the polynomial setting to the piecewise polynomial context. Specifically, we study the growth of the maximum number of crossing limit cycles in planar piecewise polynomial vector fields of degree $n$, denoted by $H_c(n)$. The best previously known general lower bound is $H_c(n)\geq 2n - 1$. In this work, we show that $H_c(n)$ grows at least as fast as $n^2/4.$ Furthermore, we prove that $H_c(n)$ is strictly increasing whenever it is finite, and that in such cases this maximum can be realized by piecewise polynomial systems whose crossing limit cycles are all hyperbolic. Finally, for the more restrictive class of piecewise polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields, we adapt the recursive construction of Christopher and Lloyd to demonstrate that the corresponding maximal number of crossing limit cycles, denoted by $\widehat{H}_c(n)$, grows at least as fast as $n\log n/(2\log 2)$, thereby improving previously established linear growth estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <title>Rapid estimation of global sea surface temperatures from sparse streaming in situ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) from staggered SST measurements is essential for weather forecasting and climate projections. However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\pm 1^\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ergodic behaviour of the McKean-Vlasov equations driven by common, divergence-free transport noise. In particular, we show that in dimension $d\geq 2$, if the noise is mixing and sufficiently strong it can enforce the uniqueness of invariant probability measures, even if the deterministic part of equation has multiple steady states.</description>

      <title>Canonical chain complexes for Morse-Smale vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1960, Smale defined a filtration of a closed smooth manifold by the unstable manifolds of fixed points and closed orbits of a Morse-Smale vector field defined on it, and derived generalized Morse inequalities. This suggests that, similarly to the Morse chain complex of a gradient-like vector field, even in the presence of closed orbits, Morse-Smale vector fields admit canonical chain complexes, invariant under topological equivalence, from which one can algebraically derive Morse inequalities. In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the \v{C}ech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration. In particular, we turn bounded exact couples into chain complexes such that the limit page of the spectral sequence associated with an exact couple gives the homology of the chain complex. We showcase our construction with examples.</description>

      <title>On Global Weak Solutions for the Magnetic Two-Component Hunter-Saxton System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS), which was recently derived in \cite{M24} as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional configuration space. While the geometric framework and the global weak flow were outlined there, the present paper provides the analytical foundations of this construction from the PDE perspective.
  First, we derive an explicit solution formula in Lagrangian variables via a Riccati reduction, yielding an alternative proof of the blow-up criterion together with an explicit expression for the blow-up time. Second, we rigorously construct global conservative weak solutions by developing the analytic theory of the relaxed configuration space and the associated weak magnetic geodesic flow, thereby realizing the geometric program proposed in \cite{M24}.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of conservative-dissipative ODE systems, which is a subclass of Lyapunov stable, linear time-invariant ODE systems. We characterize asymptotically stable, conservative-dissipative ODE systems via the hypocoercivity (theory) of their system matrices. Our main result is a concise characterization of the hypocoercivity index (an algebraic structural property of matrices with positive semi-definite Hermitian part introduced in Achleitner, Arnold, and Carlen (2018)) in terms of the short time behavior of the propagator norm for the associated conservative-dissipative ODE system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we build a geometric model for the renormalisation of irrationally indifferent fixed points of holomorphic maps with two critical points. The model incorporates arithmetic properties of the rotation number at the fixed point, as well as the "angle" between the two critical points. Using this model for the renormalisation, we build a topological model for the local dynamics of such maps. We also explain the topology of the maximal invariant set for the model, and the dynamics of the map on the maximal invariant set.</description>

      <title>Double flip bifurcations in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new bifurcation in Hamiltonian systems, which we call the double flip bifurcation. The Hamiltonian depends on two parameters, one of which controls the double flip bifurcation. The result of the bifurcation is the occurrence of two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations with respect to the other parameter. The two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations are simultaneous with respect to the first parameter, and are connected by a curve-segment of singular points. We find a normal form for Hamiltonians describing systems going through double flip bifurcations, and compute said normal form for some examples.</description>

      <title>On the Birkhoff Spectrum for Hyperbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Birkhoff spectra for hyperbolic dynamical systems. Given a H\"older observable \(f\) on a basic set \(\Lambda\), we obtain the following results: First, we characterize when the Birkhoff spectrum of \(f\) is dense in the positive (or negative) real line. Second, we prove that a bounded Birkhoff spectrum forces \(f\) to be cohomologous to zero, which constitutes an extension of Liv\v{s}ic's theorem. Moreover, we show that if the spectrum exhibits an ``arithmetically sparse'' structure, then \(f\) is cohomologous to a constant. \\ \indent We then extend these results to continuous time. For Anosov flows -- including geodesic flows on Anosov manifolds -- we establish analogous density results for Birkhoff integrals over closed orbits. In particular, we generalize a theorem of Dairbekov--Sharafutdinov \cite{Dairbekov} by proving that a bounded (resp.~arithmetically sparse) spectrum forces a smooth function to vanish (resp.~be constant).</description>

      <title>The Hydra Map and Numen Formalisms for Collatz-Type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper details a generalization of the formalism presented in the author's 2024 paper, "The Collatz Conjecture and Non-Archimedean Spectral Theory - Part I - Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory", to the case of Hydra maps on the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a global field $K$. In addition to recounting these definitions, background material is presented for the necessary standard material in algebraic number theory and integration and Fourier analysis with respect to the $p$-adic Haar measure. This paper is meant to serve as a technical manual for use of Hydra maps and numens in future research.</description>

      <title>Weaker quantization dimension results for self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of self-similar measures, particularly when the IFS does not satisfy the separation condition, but the sub-IFS at some level satisfies the separation condition. Further, we study the approximation of the space of Borel probability measures $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^m)$ with respect to the geometric mean error, i.e., the quantization dimension of order zero.</description>

      <title>Uniform Bounds on S-Integral Torsion Points for $\mathbb{G}_m$ and Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, $S$ a finite set of places. For $\mathbb{G}_m$ or an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K$, we establish uniformity results on the number of $S$-integral torsion points relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$, as $\beta$ varies over number fields of bounded degree. In particular for $\mathbb{G}_m$, if $D$ is a positive integer, we prove a uniform bound on the degree of a torsion point $\zeta$ that is $S$-integral relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$ with degree $\leq D$.</description>

      <title>$S$-Integral Points in Orbits on $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $S$ a finite set of places of $K$ that contains all of the archimedean places. Let $\varphi: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ defined over $K$. Given $\alpha \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-preperiodic and $\beta \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-exceptional, we prove an upper bound of the form $O(|S|^{1+\epsilon})$ on the number of points in the forward orbit of $\alpha$ that are $S$-integral relative to $\beta$, extending results of Hsia--Silverman [HS11]. We also prove uniform bounds when $\varphi$ is a polynomial, extending resaults of Krieger et al [KLS+15].</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling through Koopman Spectral Analysis: An Operator-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a particle-based generative modeling framework that learns the Langevin generator via Koopman theory and integrates it with Wasserstein gradient descent. Our key insight is that this spectral structure of the underlying distribution can be directly estimated from trajectory data via the Koopman operator, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential. Additionally, we prove that KSWGD maintains an approximately constant dissipation rate, thereby establishing linear convergence and overcoming the vanishing-gradient phenomenon that hinders existing kernel-based particle methods. We further provide a Feynman--Kac interpretation that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments on compact manifolds, metastable multi-well systems, and high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations demonstrate that KSWGD consistently outperforms baselines in both convergence speed and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>
