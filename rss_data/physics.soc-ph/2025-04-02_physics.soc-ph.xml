      <title>Producing population-level estimates of internal displacement in Ukraine using GPS mobile phone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly 110 million people are forcibly displaced people worldwide. However, estimating the scale and patterns of internally displaced persons in real time, and developing appropriate policy responses, remain hindered by traditional data streams. They are infrequently updated, costly and slow. Mobile phone location data can overcome these limitations, but only represent a population segment. Drawing on an anonymised large-scale, high-frequency dataset of locations from 25 million mobile devices, we propose an approach to leverage mobile phone data and produce population-level estimates of internal displacement. We use this approach to quantify the extent, pace and geographic patterns of internal displacement in Ukraine during the early stages of the Russian invasion in 2022. Our results produce reliable population-level estimates, enabling real-time monitoring of internal displacement at detailed spatio-temporal resolutions. Accurate estimations are crucial to support timely and effective humanitarian and disaster management responses, prioritising resources where they are most needed.</description>

      <title>Four Things People Should Know About Migraines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migraine literacy among the public is known to be low, and this lack of understanding has a negative impact on migraineurs' quality of life. To understand this impact, we use text mining methods to study migraine discussion on the Reddit social media platform. We summarize the findings in the form of "four things people should know about chronic migraines": it is a serious disease that affects people of all ages, it can be triggered by many different factors, it affects women more than men, and it can get worse in combination with the COVID-19 virus.</description>

      <title>Effects of Mobile Gacha Games on Gambling Behavior and Psychological Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines how Gacha games affect gambling practices by analyzing when players start playing and how often they play and how much money they spend on games. The modified Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) serves as the research tool to examine the impact of these variables on mobile Gacha game gambling-like severity. A survey distributed to online Gacha game communities provided the data which researchers analyzed by applying linear regression and multiple regression and T-test methods. The research indicates entry age demonstrated low association with gambling severity but gameplay frequency together with duration directly influenced higher gambling severity ratings. The research findings demonstrated that the level of Gacha game spending directly influences gambling severity scores among players. The research findings demonstrate how addictive potential exists in mobile Gacha games which requires stronger regulation of these platforms for young vulnerable gamers. Research needs to study the extended influence of Gacha game exposure while examining how cognitive biases affect gambling behavior patterns.</description>

      <title>Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal structures of large organizations determine much of what occurs inside including the way in which tasks are performed, the workers that perform them, and the mobility of those workers within the organization. However, regarding this latter process, most of the theoretical and modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large US government organization, we introduce a new model to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers that change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past co-workers. In this organization, 34\% of all moves lead to worker reunions, a percentage well-above expectation. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Technological Solutions for Addressing Water Scarcity in Agricultural Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This comprehensive study investigates the intricate relationship between water scarcity and agricultural production, emphasizing its critical global significance. The research, through multidimensional analysis, investigates the various effects of water scarcity on crop productivity, especially the economic water scarcity (AEWS) which is the main factor of influence. The study stresses the possibility of vertical farming as a viable solution to the different kinds of water scarcity problems, hence, it emphasizes its function in the sustainable agricultural development. Although the study recognizes that some problems still remain, it also points out the necessity of more research to solve the issues of scalability and socio-economic implications. Moving forward, interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation are essential to achieving water-secure agriculture and societal resilience.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>A Hard-Science Approach to Kondratieff's Economic Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to evidence the Kondratieff cycle more scientifically than the way economists do, physical variables are studied rather than monetary indicators. Previously published graphs are reproduced and updated here with recent data. A cyclical rather regular variation of energy consumption reveals a 56-year cycle. A dozen human endeavors/phenomena, such as bank failures, homicides, hurricanes, feminism, and sunspot activity are shown to resonate with this cycle. Possible explanations for this phenomenon may have to do with a climatic variation or with the length of time any individual actively influences the environment. There is some evidence that the cycle may be getting shorter in amplitude and duration in recent years. All quantitative confidence levels involved in these observations are poor by scientific standards and permit critics to question the very existence of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>IPSR Model: Misinformation Intervention through Prebunking in Social Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present digital world, the rapid spread of misinformation is not just an annoyance but a real threat to public safety, and our collective decision-making. Prebunking, a type of psychological immunization, can educate people about misinformation and lay a foundation of cognitive resilience that makes them more robust against future misinformation. We use a compartmental modeling approach inspired by vaccination models from epidemiology to model the effectiveness of prebunking misinformation. Populations are classified into different compartments based on the exposure to prebunking and the propagation of misinformation through online social networks. Specific rates dictate the transitions between such states, similar to how people traverse between susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments in classical epidemiological models. This model integrates different levels of prebunking potency, the fraction of the population prebunked initially, and the forgetting rate effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work which study the extent of prebunking interventions to reduce the scale of misinformation, much as vaccinations curtail the spread of infectious diseases.</description>
