      <title>Consumption Stimulus with Digital Coupons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study consumption stimulus with digital coupons, which provide time-limited subsidies contingent on minimum spending. We analyze a large-scale program in China and present five main findings: (1) the program generates large short-term effects, with each $\yen$1 of government subsidy inducing $\yen$3.4 in consumer spending; (2) consumption responses vary substantially, driven by both demand-side factors (e.g., wealth) and supply-side factors (e.g., local consumption amenities); (3) The largest spending increases occur among consumers whose baseline spending already exceeds coupon thresholds and for whom coupon subsidies should be equivalent to cash, suggesting behavioral motivations; (4) high-response consumers disproportionately direct their spending toward large businesses, leading to a regressive allocation of stimulus benefits; and (5) targeting the most responsive consumers can double total stimulus effects. A hybrid design combining targeted distribution with direct support to small businesses improves both the efficiency and equity of the program.</description>

      <title>Pay Clauses in Public Procurement: The Wage Impact of Collective Bargaining Compliance Laws in Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using administrative data from Germany, this study provides first evidence on the wage effects of collective bargaining compliance laws. These laws require establishments receiving public contracts to pay wages set by a representative collective agreement, even if they are not formally bound by one. Leveraging variation in the timing of law implementation across federal states, and focusing on the public transport sector -- where regulation is uniform and demand is driven solely by state-level needs -- I estimate dynamic treatment effects using event-study designs. The results indicate that within five years of the law's implementation, wage increases were on average 2.9\% to 4.6\% higher in federal states with such a law compared to those without one -- but only in East Germany. These findings highlight the potential for securing collectively agreed wages in times of declining collective bargaining coverage.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Scarcity: The Economics of Unresolvable Unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination: interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights. Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms, interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned, and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational social control.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Compute Constrained Optimal Carbon Tax Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a computational framework for deriving Pareto-improving and constrained optimal carbon tax rules in a stochastic overlapping generations (OLG) model with climate change. By integrating Deep Equilibrium Networks for fast policy evaluation and Gaussian process surrogate modeling with Bayesian active learning, the framework systematically locates optimal carbon tax schedules for heterogeneous agents exposed to climate risk. We apply our method to a 12-period OLG model in which exogenous shocks affect the carbon intensity of energy production, as well as the damage function. Constrained optimal carbon taxes consist of tax rates that are simple functions of observables and revenue-sharing rules that guarantee that the introduction of the taxes is Pareto improving. This reveals that a straightforward policy is highly effective: a Pareto-improving linear tax on cumulative emissions alone yields a 0.42% aggregate welfare gain in consumption-equivalent terms while adding further complexity to the tax provides only a marginal increase to 0.45%. The application demonstrates that the proposed approach produces scalable tools for macro-policy design in complex stochastic settings. Beyond climate economics, the framework offers a template for systematically analyzing welfare-improving policies in various heterogeneous-agent problems.</description>

      <title>Differential Test Performance and Peer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use variation of test scores measuring closely related skills to isolate peer effects. The intuition for our identification strategy is that the difference in closely related scores eliminates factors common to the performance in either test while retaining idiosyncratic test specific variation. Common factors include unobserved teacher and group effects as well as test invariant ability and factors relevant for peer group formation. Peer effects work through idiosyncratic shocks which have the interpretation of individual and test specific ability or effort. We use education production functions as well as restrictions on the information content of unobserved test taking ability to formalize our approach. An important implication of our identifying assumptions is that we do not need to rely on randomized group assignment. We show that our model restrictions are sufficient for the formulation of linear and quadratic moment conditions that identify the peer effects parameter of interest. We use Project STAR data to empirically measure peer effects in kindergarten through third grade classes. We find evidence of highly significant peer effects with magnitudes that are at the lower end of the range of estimates found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Early and Accurate Recession Detection Using Classifiers on the Anticipation-Precision Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new method for detecting US recessions in real time. The method constructs millions of recession classifiers by combining unemployment and vacancy data to reduce detection noise. Classifiers are then selected to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). The selected classifiers are therefore perfect, in that they identify all 15 historical recessions in the 1929--2021 training period without any false positives. By further selecting classifiers that lie on the high-precision segment of the anticipation-precision frontier, the method optimizes early detection without sacrificing precision. On average, over 1929--2021, the classifier ensemble signals recessions 2.2 months after their true onset, with a standard deviation of detection errors of 1.9 months. Applied to May 2025 data, the classifier ensemble gives a 71% probability that the US economy is currently in recession. A placebo test and backtests confirm the algorithm's reliability. Algorithms trained on limited historical windows continue to detect all subsequent out-of-sample recessions without errors. Furthermore, they all detect the Great Recession by mid-2008 -- even when they are only trained on data up to 1984 or 1964. The classifier ensembles trained on 1929--2004, 1929--1984, and 1929--1964 data give a current recession probability of 58%, 83%, and 25%, respectively.</description>
