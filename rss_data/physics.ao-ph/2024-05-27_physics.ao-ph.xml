      <title>Gibbs states and Brownian models for coexisting haze and cloud droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds microphysics describes the formation and evolution of cloud droplets, rain, and ice particles. It is among the most critical factors in determining the cloud's size, lifetime, precipitation, and radiative effect. Among all cloud types, the small clouds, characterized by weak updrafts, that are close to the haze-to-cloud transition pose challenges in measuring them and understanding their properties. They are superabundant but hard to capture by satellites and often falsely regarded as aerosols. K\"ohler's theory explains droplet activation and their growth by condensation at the earliest stages of cloud development. It fully describes the thermodynamic state of a single drop but falls short when explaining the collective behavior of large populations of particles. This is especially important when the supersaturation pool is limited. We present an analytical framework to extend K\"ohler's theory to coexisting cloud droplets. Our results suggest hysteresis and asymmetry in the process of droplet activation and deactivation. The turbulent nature of clouds is incorporated into our model formulation as Brownian noise to provide explicit droplet size distributions and activation timescales. The theoretical findings are confronted with experimental data stemming from laboratory clouds created in the Pi convection chamber, suggesting a new way of understanding haze-to-cloud transitions and small cloud formation processes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cumulus Clouds and CCNs Regeneration on Aerosol Vertical Distribution and Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs a high-resolution (10m) System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) coupled with the Spectral Bin Microphysical (SBM) scheme to thoroughly investigate the processes governing the evolution of aerosol properties within and outside a shallow cumulus cloud. The model encompasses the complete life cycle of cloud droplets, starting from their formation through their evolution until their complete evaporation or sedimentation to the ground. Additionally, the model tracks the aerosols' evolution both within droplets and in the air. Aerosols are transported within the droplets, grow by droplet coalescence, and are released into the atmosphere after droplet evaporation (regeneration process). The aerosol concentration increases by droplet evaporation and decreases along with falling drops. So, the effects of clouds on the surrounding aerosols depend on the microphysical and dynamic processes, which in turn depend on the amount of background aerosols; here, we compare clean and polluted conditions. It is shown that clouds significantly impact the vertical profile of aerosol concentration in the lower troposphere, as well as their size distribution, and can serve as a source of large (giant) cloud condensation nuclei. Furthermore, it is shown that both precipitating and non-precipitating boundary layer clouds contribute to a substantial increase in aerosol concentration within the inversion layer due to intense evaporation.</description>

      <title>Highly inhomogeneous interactions between background climate and urban warming across typical local climate zones in heatwave and non-heatwave days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban heat island (UHI) in conjunction with heatwave (HW) leads to exacerbation of thermal stress in urban areas. Prior research on UHI and HW has predominantly concentrated on examining the thermal conditions at the surface and near-surface, with few investigations extending to the radiative and dynamical interactions of UHI and HW, particularly with a focus on the inhomogeneities across local climate zones (LCZs). Here, we analyse the temperature disparity between HW and non-HW conditions across LCZs in the Sydney area by quantifying the contributions of individual radiative and dynamical processes using the coupled surface-atmosphere climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM). Three HW events in 2017, 2019, and 2020 are simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM). The maximum temperature difference between HW and non-HW days may reach up to 10 K, with the increased net solar radiation during HWs being comparable to the typical level of anthropogenic heat flux in urban areas. It is also found that the reduction of clouds, the presence of vapor, and the increase of sensible heat contribute to the warming effect at different levels, with the contribution of clouds being the most dominant. Conversely, the generation of dry convection and the increase of latent heat flux lead to mitigating effects, with the latter being more dominant and capable of causing up to 10 K surface temperature difference between LCZ1 (compact high-rise) and LCZ9 (sparsely built). The differences in the contributions of climate feedback processes across different LCZs become more evident during more severe and humid HWs. These findings underscore the necessity of implementing local climate zone-tailored heat mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Impacts of extreme weather events on terrestrial carbon sequestration revealed by weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of global climate extremes has significantly impacted the terrestrial carbon cycle. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and extreme precipitation pose serious threats to ecosystem carbon sequestration. This study investigated the impacts of these extreme events on terrestrial carbon sequestration using data from weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere, by combining weather station observations and machine learning-based Gross Primary Production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) estimates. Droughts and heatwaves have the most significant impact, often correlated as compound events. The effects of extreme precipitation and cold extremes may have been underestimated in the past. Whether various extreme events occur in spring or summer led to different mechanisms. We provided a more precise and station-specific analysis compared to using coarse-resolution climate reanalysis and model simulations. It also suggests the need for improved methodologies and the integration of data-driven and process-based models to better predict and understand the effects of extreme weather on ecosystem carbon cycling.</description>

      <title>LUCIE: A Lightweight Uncoupled ClImate Emulator with long-term stability and physical consistency for O(1000)-member ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LUCIE, a $1000$- member ensemble data-driven atmospheric emulator that remains stable during autoregressive inference for thousands of years without a drifting climatology. LUCIE has been trained on $9.5$ years of coarse-resolution ERA5 data with $4$ prognostic variables on a single A100 GPU for $2.4$ h. Owing to the cheap computational cost of inference, $1000$ model ensembles are executed for $5$ years to compute an uncertainty-quantified climatology for the prognostic variables that closely match the climatology obtained from ERA5. Unlike all the other state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE is neither unstable nor does it produce hallucinations that result in unphysical drift of the emulated climate. Furthermore, LUCIE \textbf{does not impose} ``true" sea-surface temperature (SST) from a coupled numerical model to enforce the annual cycle in temperature. We demonstrate the long-term climatology obtained from LUCIE as well as subseasonal-to-seasonal scale prediction skills on the prognostic variables. We also demonstrate a $20$-year emulation with LUCIE here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRmhx9RRGiF3uGo_mRQK8RpwQatrCiMn/view</description>

      <title>100-fold improvement in relaxed eddy accumulation flux estimates through error diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of atmosphere-surface exchange are largely limited by the availability of fast-response gas analyzers; this limitation hampers our understanding of the role of terrestrial ecosystems in atmospheric chemistry and global change. Current micrometeorological methods, compatible with slow-response gas analyzers, are difficult to implement or rely on empirical parameters that introduce large systematic errors. Here, we develop a new micrometeorological method, optimized for slow-response gas analyzers, that directly measures exchange rates of different atmospheric constituents with minimal requirements. The new method requires only sampling air at a constant rate and directing it into one of two reservoirs, depending on the direction of the vertical wind velocity. An integral component of this technique is an error diffusion algorithm that minimizes the biases in the measured fluxes and achieves direct flux estimates. We demonstrate that the new method provides an unbiased estimate of the flux, with accuracy within 0.1% of the reference eddy covariance flux, and importantly, allows for significant enhancements in signal-to-noise ratio of measured scalars without compromising accuracy. Our new method provides a simple and reliable way to address complex environmental questions and offers a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of ecological systems and atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>Direct Statistical Simulation using generalised cumulant expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Generalised Quasilinear (GQL) approximation has been developed and its efficacy tested against purely quasilinear (QL) approximations. GQL systematically interpolates between QL and fully non-linear dynamics by employing a generalised Reynolds decomposition. Here, we examine an exact statistical closure for the GQL equations on the doubly periodic $\beta$-plane. Closure is achieved at second order using a generalised cumulant approach which we term GCE2. GCE2 is shown to yield improved performance over statistical representations of purely QL dynamics (CE2) and thus enables Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) of complex mean flows that do not entirely fall within the remit of pure QL theory. Despite the existence of an exact closure, GCE2 like CE2 admits the possibility of a rank instability that leads to differences with statistics obtained from GQL. Recognition of this instability is a necessary step before further progress can be made with the GCE2 statistical closure.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Predictive Modeling of Short-term Impacts of Hurricanes on the US Employment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical and economic damages of hurricanes can acutely affect employment and the well-being of employees. However, a comprehensive understanding of these impacts remains elusive as many studies focused on narrow subsets of regions or hurricanes. Here we present an open-source dataset that serves interdisciplinary research on hurricane impacts on US employment. Compared to past domain-specific efforts, this dataset has greater spatial-temporal granularity and variable coverage. To demonstrate potential applications of this dataset, we focus on the short-term employment disruptions related to hurricanes during 1990-2020. The observed county-level employment changes in the initial month are small on average, though large employment losses (&gt;30%) can occur after extreme storms. The overall small changes partly result from compensation among different employment sectors, which may obscure large, concentrated employment losses after hurricanes. Additional econometric analyses concur on the post-storm employment losses in hospitality and leisure but disagree on employment changes in the other industries. The dataset also enables data-driven analyses that highlight vulnerabilities such as pronounced employment losses related to Puerto Rico and rainy hurricanes. Furthermore, predictive modeling of short-term employment changes shows promising performance for service-providing industries and high-impact storms. In the examined cases, the nonlinear Random Forests model greatly outperforms the multiple linear regression model. The nonlinear model also suggests that more severe hurricane hazards projected by physical models may cause more extreme losses in US service-providing employment. Finally, we share our dataset and analytical code to facilitate the study and modeling of hurricane impacts in a changing climate.</description>
