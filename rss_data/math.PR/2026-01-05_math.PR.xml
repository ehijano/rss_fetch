      <title>The largest common subtree of two random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size and structure of the largest common subtree (LCS) between two independent Bienaym\'e trees conditioned to have size $n$. When the trees are critical with finite $2$nd and $(2+\kappa)$th moment respectively for some $\kappa&gt;0$, we prove that the LCS has size of order $\sqrt{n}$, and is approximated by the length of three paths meeting at a central node. Moreover, we show that the largest common subtree between two critical independent Bienaym\'e trees with size $n$ and finite second moments may be much larger than $\sqrt{n}$, implying that our result is tight. We also pose a number of open questions and suggestions for future research.</description>

      <title>Exponential ergodicity of first order endotactic stochastic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are a widely accepted modeling framework for diverse science phenomena stemming from all disciplines of science, such as biochemistry, ecology, epidemiology, social and political science. In this paper we prove that every first order endotactic stochastic mass-action reaction system (SMART) is essential (i.e., every state in the state space is within a closed communicating class of the underlying continuous time Markov chain model) and is exponentially ergodic. The proof is based on a recent result on first order endotactic reaction networks in a companion paper [C.X., First order endotactic reaction networks. arXiv:2409.01598v2]. Besides, we show that a stochastic reaction system (of possibly nonlinear propensities) dominated by a first order endotactic SMART is exponentially erogdic. To demonstrate the applicability of results, we provide various examples of higher order SMART, including e.g., (1) SMART with a first order endotactic asymptotic limit as well as, (2) joint of translations of first order endotactic SMART.</description>

      <title>The probability of connection between two vertices cannot be monotone with the distance for Bernoulli Percolation on transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular question in Bernoulli percolation models is if the probability of connection between two vertices in a transitive graph decays monotonically with the distance between these two vertices. For example, on the square lattice is an open question to prove that the probability of the origin being connected to the vertex $(0,n)$ is monotone in $n$. In this short note, we exhibit an example of a transitive graph in which the probability of connection between vertices does not necessarily decay as the distance of those vertices grows. We also define a critical point for percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, in which using a generalization of the percolation process it is possible to see the same phenomena happening in the embedding of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Effective geometric ergodicty for Markov chains in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we prove ``effective" geometric ergodicity (i.e a Perron-Frobenius theorem) for Markov chains in random mixing dynamical environment satisfying a random non-uniform version of the Doeblin condition. Effectivity here means that all the random variables involved in the random exponential rates are integrable with arbitrarily large order. This compliments \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Kifer 1996}, where ``non-effective" geometric ergodicity was obtained. From a different perspective, our result is also motivated by egrodic theory, as it can be seen as an effective version of the ``spectral" gap in the top Oseledets space in the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem for the random Markov operator cocycle (when it applies). We also present applications of the effective ergodicity to rates in the (quenched) almost sure invariance principle (ASIP), exponential decay of correlations for Markovian skew products and for exponential tails for random mixing times. As a byproduct of the proof of the ASIP rates we also provide easy to verify sufficient conditions for the verification of the assumptions of \cite[Theorem 2.4]{Kifer 1998}.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism of Stochastic Equilibrium Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economics, construction of perfect models in a way that would be comparable to the standards customary in physical sciences is generally not feasible. In particular, the observed value for an economic equilibrium may deviate significantly from its model-based a priori expected value. Mathematically, the a posteriori observed equilibrium may then represent a large deviation in the sense that it falls outside the region of validity of the Central Limit Theorem. With this as the motivating starting point, we propose a new approach to the theory of stochastic economic equilibrium. Drawing on recent developments in probability theory, we argue for the relevance of the theory of large deviations in stochastic equilibrium economics. Thereby the formalism of stochastic equilibrium economics becomes analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics, as the theory of large deviations forms also the mathematical basis of statistical mechanics. In consequence, thermodynamic concepts such as entropy, partition function and canonical probability can be introduced in a natural way to stochastic equilibrium economics. We focus here on the economic analogs of two fundamental principles, the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Gibbs Conditioning Principle.</description>

      <title>Voronoi Percolation: Topological Stability and Giant Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological stability of Voronoi percolation in higher dimensions. We show that slightly increasing p allows a discretization that preserves increasing topological properties with high probability. This strengthens a theorem of Bollob\'as and Riordan and generalizes it to higher dimensions. As a consequence, we prove a sharp phase transition for the emergence of i-dimensional giant cycles in Voronoi percolation on the 2i-dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Affine Invariant Langevin Dynamics for rare-event sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an affine invariant Langevin dynamics (ALDI) framework for the efficient estimation of rare events in nonlinear dynamical systems. Rare events are formulated as Bayesian inverse problems through a nonsmooth limit-state function whose zero level set characterises the event of interest. To overcome the nondifferentiability of this function, we propose a smooth approximation that preserves the failure set and yields a posterior distribution satisfying the small-noise limit. The resulting potential is sampled by ALDI, a (derivative-free) interacting particle system whose affine invariance allows it to adapt to the local anisotropy of the posterior.
  We demonstrate the performance of the method across a hierarchy of benchmarks, namely two low-dimensional examples (an algebraic problem with convex geometry and a dynamical problem of saddle-type instability) and a point-vortex model for atmospheric blockings. In all cases, ALDI concentrates near the relevant near-critical sets and provides accurate proposal distributions for self-normalised importance sampling. The framework is computationally robust, potentially gradient-free, and well-suited for complex forward models with strong geometric anisotropy. These results highlight ALDI as a promising tool for rare-event estimation in unstable regimes of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the maximal solution of the supercooled Stefan problem in 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of the maximal weak solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem in 1 dimension. This follows by showing that in 1 dimension, the optimal solution of the corresponding free target optimal transport problem given in \cite{GeneralDimensions}, is independent of the choice of the cost function. Moreover, we show that the supercooled Stefan problem lacks monotonicity and $L^1$-Lipschitz stability, which are available in a similar problem considered in a previous paper \cite{freetarget}. However, in $1$ dimension, it has stability in the weak convergence of measures.</description>

Abstract: Let $S_k$ be a sequence of compact hyperbolic surfaces of increasing volume which locally converges to a random rooted surface. We show that if the normalized sum of the reciprocal lengths of very short simple closed geodesics converges to 0, then the normalized logarithm of the determinant of the Laplacian of $S_k$ converges to a constant depending only the law of the limiting surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of Pfaffian Schur processes whose first coordinate marginal relates to the half--space geometric last passage percolation. We show that the line ensembles corresponding to the Pfaffian Schur processes with geometric weights converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy line ensemble. By detailed asymptotic analysis of the kernels, we can verify the conditions for the finite dimensional weak convergence introduced in arXiv:2408.08445. By utilizing the tightness criteria of the line ensembles established in arXiv:2410.23899, we can further improve the finite dimensional convergence to the uniform convergence over compact sets. Moreover, using the same methodology we also show that sequences of spiked Pfaffian Schur processes converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles constructed in arXiv:2408.08445.</description>

      <title>Large-scale distributed synchronization systems, using a cancel-on-completion redundancy mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent distributed synchronization systems, which are modeled as $n$ particles moving on the real line. This class generalizes the model of a multi-server queueing system, considered in [15], employing so-called cancel-on-completion (c.o.c.) redundancy mechanism, but is motivated by other applications as well. The model in [15] is a particle system, regulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is such that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no regulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the number of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job arrival rates per particle remain constant. The system state for a given $n$ is the empirical distribution of the particles' locations. The results include: the existence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe the limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic independence (concentration of the stationary distribution on a single ML fixed point); the limits of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system advances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and generalize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical approach is such that the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a unified framework.</description>

Abstract: A step-graphon has the strong (resp., weak) $H$-property if a directed, random graph sampled from it has a Hamilton cycle (resp., a node-wise disjoint cycle cover) asymptotically almost surely. The weak/strong $H$-property is essentially a zero-one property. We identify key objects associated with the step-graphon that matter for the zero-one law and provide a complete characterization.</description>

Abstract: In 2020, F. Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the weak limit of a suitably scaled continuous-time random walk (CTRW) is the Brownian motion. We investigate the convergence of certain patterned random matrices whose entries are independent CTRWs and their time-changed versions, in a non-commutative probability framework. For the Wigner link function, the limits are free Brownian motion and its time-changed version driven by an inverse stable subordinator. For the symmetric circulant and the circulant with CTRW entries, we use their explicit eigenvalue expressions to define some empirical processes that converge weakly to a Brownian motion and a complex Brownian motion, respectively. For matrices with iid entries, and for elliptic matrices, the algebraic limits are equal in $*$-distribution to processes whose marginals are circular and elliptic variables, respectively. A random time-changed variant of these results is also established.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; 2\gamma/(1+\gamma)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of random surfaces, especially in the asymptotics of large genus, has been of increasing interest in recent years. Many geometrical questions have analogous formulations in the theory of random graphs with a large number of vertices, and results obtained in one area can inspire the other. In this paper, we are interested in the diameter of random surfaces, a basic measure of the connectivity of the surface. We introduce a new class of models of random surfaces built from random graphs and we compute the asymptotics of the diameter of these surfaces, which is logarithmic in the genus of the surface. The strategy of the proof relies on a detailed study of an exploration process which is the analogue of the breadth-first search exploration of a random graph. Its analysis is based on subadditive and concentration techniques.</description>

In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Energy Market Contracts: Dynkin Game with Doubly RBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a Contract for Difference (CfD) with early exit options as a two-player zero-sum Dynkin game, reflecting the strategic interaction between an electricity producer and a regulatory entity. The game incorporates penalties for early termination and mean-reverting price dynamics, with the value characterized through a doubly reflected backward stochastic differential equation (DRBSDE).
  To compute the contract value and optimal stopping strategies, we develop a neural solver that approximates the DRBSDE solution using a sequence of neural networks trained on simulated trajectories. The method avoids discretizing the state space, supports time-dependent barriers, and scales to high-dimensional settings. We establish a convergence result and test the method on two scenarios: a benchmark symmetric game in 20 dimensions, and a CfD model with 24-dimensional electricity prices representing multiple European zones.
  The results demonstrate that the proposed solver accurately captures the contract's value and optimal stopping regions, with consistent performance across dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>No-prior Bayes reIMagined: probabilistic approximations of inferential models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When prior information is lacking, the go-to strategy for probabilistic inference is to combine a "default prior" and the likelihood via Bayes's theorem. Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under this umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior distributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty quantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach that yields posterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed construction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the mathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly valid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner probabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation inherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible sets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also agrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution in applications where the model has a group invariance structure. A Monte Carlo method for evaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities and asymptotics of McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for solutions to the McKean-Vlasov (granular media) equation on the flat torus in a genuinely nonconvex setting. Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials. This yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without convexity assumption and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows. In the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a prominent application.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
