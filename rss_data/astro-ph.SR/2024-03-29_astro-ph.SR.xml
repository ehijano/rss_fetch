      <title>Anatomy of the Class I protostar L1489 IRS with NOEMA -- I. Disk, streamers, outflow(s) and bubbles at 3mm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, chemical studies have revealed multiple structures in the vicinity of young stellar objects (YSOs). It has become evident that specific physical conditions are associated with the emission of particular molecular lines, allowing us to use molecular probes of the YSO physics. Consequently, chemical surveys are now necessary to fully constrain the origin of the observed structures. Several surveys have been conducted to explore the chemistry of YSOs, focusing on Class 0 and Class II objects. However, our knowledge of intermediate objects, that are Class I objects, remains limited. To bridge the gap and establish the relationship between observed structures and molecular line emission at the Class I evolutionary stage, we investigate the spatial distribution of key molecular gas species in the low-mass Class I protostar L1489 IRS (IRAS 04016+2610), a source part of the ChemYSO survey. We performed a 3mm line survey at high spatial and high spectral resolution using the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM-30m telescope. We present here the ten brightest lines of our survey, in which we identified a new ~ 3 000 au long streamer in HC3N, C2H, and c-C3H2 emission, likely associated with more localized accretion shocks probed in SO. In addition, two ~ 10 000 au bubbles are seen with the dense molecular tracers HCO+, CS, and HCN around the YSO. Additionally, potential indicators of a second outflow appear in CS and HCN emission, but its nature remains to be confirmed. The late infall identified at large scales may originate from the nearby prestellar core L1489 and is likely responsible for the formation of an external warped disk in this system. The detection of a potential second outflow could be the direct evidence of a binary system. Finally, we hypothesize that the bubbles may result from the magnetic pressure as observed in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Presupernova evolution and explosive nucleosynthesis of rotating massive stars II: the Super Solar models at [Fe/H]=0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the set of models published in Limongi &amp; Chieffi, 2018, ApJS, 237, 13, at metallicity two times solar, i.e. [Fe/H]=0.3. The key physical properties of these models at the onset of the core collapse are mainly due to the higher mass loss triggered by the higher metallicity: the super solar metallicity (SSM) models reach the core collapse with smaller He- and CO-core masses, while the amount of 12C left by the central He burning is higher. These results are valid for all the rotation velocities. The yields of the neutron capture nuclei expressed per unit mass of Oxygen (i.e. the X/O) are higher in the SSM models than in the SM ones in the non rotating case while the opposite occurs in the rotating models. The trend shown by the non rotating models is the expected one, given the secondary nature of the n-capture nucleosynthesis. Vice versa, the counter intuitive trend obtained in the rotating models is the consequence of the higher mass loss present in the SSM models that removes the H rich envelope faster than in the SM ones while the stars are still in central He burning, dumping out the entanglement (activated by the rotation instabilities) and therefore a conspicuous primary n-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Complexity of emerging magnetic flux during lifetime of solar ephemeral regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a relatively active region, ephemeral region (ER) exhibits highly complex pattern of magnetic flux emergence. We aim to study detailed secondary flux emergences (SFEs) which we define as bipoles that they appear close to ERs and finally coalesce with ERs after a period. We study the SFEs during the whole process from emergence to decay of 5 ERs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) . The maximum unsigned magnetic flux for each ER is around $10^{20}$ Mx. Each ER has tens of SFEs with an average emerging magnetic flux of approximately 5$\times10^{18}$ Mx. The frequency of normalized magnetic flux for all the SFEs follows a power law distribution with an index of -2.08 . The majority of SFEs occur between the positive and negative polarities of ER , and their growth time is concentrated within one hour. The magnetic axis of SFE is found to exhibit a random distribution in the 5 ERs. We suggest that the relationship between SFEs and ERs can be understood by regarding the photospheric magnetic field observations as cross-sections of an emerging magnetic structure. Tracking the ERs' evolution, we propose that these SFEs in ERs may be sequent emergences from the bundle of flux tube of ERs, and that SFEs are partially emerged $\Omega$-loops.</description>

      <title>The Sun's differential rotation is controlled by high-latitude baroclinically unstable inertial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating fluids have a rotation profile which depends only on the distance from the rotation axis, in accordance with the Taylor-Proudman theorem. Although the Sun was expected to be such a body, helioseismology showed that the rotation rate in the convection zone is closer to constant on radii. It has been postulated that this deviation is due to the poles being warmer than the equator by a few degrees. Using numerical simulations, we show that the pole-to-equator temperature difference cannot exceed 7 Kelvin as a result of the back-reaction of the high-latitude baroclinically unstable inertial modes. The observed amplitudes of the modes further indicate that this maximum temperature difference is reached in the Sun. We conclude that the Sun's latitudinal differential rotation reaches its maximum allowed value.</description>

      <title>Wave Reflection in the Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence supporting wave reflection in the lower solar chromosphere based on helioseismic analysis of multi-height Doppler data. This evidence is derived through a wave propagation model that incorporates both upward- and downward-traveling (reflected) waves. Moreover, we find that the height of the reflecting region varies with magnetic field strengths in a way that suggests a connection with the the plasma $\beta\sim1$ region. We measure an effective reflection coefficient of $13\,\%$ in a magnetically quiet region of the Sun.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic diagnostics of lead stratification in hot subdwarf atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy metal subdwarfs are a class of hot subdwarfs with very high abundances of heavy elements, typically around 10 000 times solar. They include stars which are strongly enhanced in either lead or zirconium, as well as other elements. Vertical stratification of the enhanced elements, where the element is concentrated in a thin layer of the atmosphere, has been proposed as a mechanism to explain the apparent high abundances. This paper explores the effects of the vertical stratification of lead on theoretical spectra of hot subdwarfs. The concentration of lead in different regions of the model atmosphere is found to affect individual lines in a broadly wavelength-dependent manner, with the potential for lines to display modified profiles depending on the location of lead enhancement in the atmosphere. This wavelength dependence highlights the importance of observations in both the optical and the UV for determining whether stratification is present in real stars.</description>

      <title>The Lorentz force at work: multi-phase magnetohydrodynamics throughout a flare lifespan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hour-long, gradual phase of solar flares is well-observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, demonstrating many multi-phase aspects, where cold condensations form within the heated post-flare system, but a complete three-dimensional (3D) model is lacking. Using a state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we identify the key role played by the Lorentz force through the entire flare lifespan, and show that slow variations in the post-flare magnetic field achieve the bulk of the energy release. Synthetic images in multiple passbands closely match flare observations, and we quantify the role of conductive, radiative and Lorentz force work contributions from flare onset to decay. This highlights how the non-force-free nature of the magnetic topology is crucial to trigger Rayleigh-Taylor dynamics, observed as waving coronal rays in extreme ultraviolet observations. Our C-class solar flare reproduces multi-phase aspects such as post-flare coronal rain. In agreement with observations, we find strands of cooler plasma forming spontaneously by catastrophic cooling, leading to cool plasma draining down the post-flare loops. As there is force balance between magnetic pressure and tension and the plasma pressure in gradual-phase flare loops, this has potential for coronal seismology to decipher the magnetic field strength variation from observations.</description>

      <title>Titanium abundances in late-type stars, II. Grid of departure coefficients and application to a sample of $70\,000$ stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly growing datasets from stellar spectroscopic surveys are providing unprecedented opportunities to analyse the chemical evolution history of our Galaxy. However, spectral analysis requires accurate modelling of synthetic stellar spectra for late-type stars, for which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) has been shown to be insufficient in many cases. Errors associated with LTE can be particularly large for Ti I, which is susceptible to over-ionisation, particularly in metal-poor stars. The aims of this work are to study and quantify the 1D non-LTE effects on titanium abundances across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for a large sample of stars. A large grid of departure coefficients, $\beta_\nu$, were computed on standard MARCS model atmospheres. The grid extends from 3000K to 8000K in T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, -0.5 to +5.5 dex in log(g), and -5.0 to +1.0 in [Fe/H], with non-LTE effects in this grid reaching up to 0.4 dex. This was used to compute abundance corrections that were subsequently applied to the LTE abundances of over 70,000 stars selected from the GALAH survey and additional metal-poor dwarfs. The non-LTE effects grow towards lower [Fe/H], lower log(g), and higher T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$, with a minimum and maximum $\Delta$A(Ti I) of 0.02 and 0.19 in the GALAH sample. For metal-poor giants, the non-LTE modelling reduces the average ionisation imbalance from -0.11 dex to -0.01 dex at [Fe/H] = -1.7, and the enhancement in titanium abundances from Ti I lines results in a [Ti/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend that more closely resembles the behaviour of Ti II at low metallicities. Non-LTE effects on titanium abundances are significant. Neglecting them may alter our understanding of Galactic chemical evolution. We have made our grid of departure coefficients publicly available, with the caveat that the Ti abundances of metal-poor dwarfs need further study in 3D non-LTE.</description>

      <title>JWST study of the DG Tau B disk wind candidate: I -- Overview and Nested H$_2$/CO outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and impact of outflows on proto-planetary disks and planet formation are key open questions. DG Tau B, a Class I protostar with a structured disk and a striking rotating conical CO outflow, recently identified with ALMA as one of the best MHD disk wind candidate, is an ideal target for studying these phenomena. Our aim is to analyse the outflow components intermediate between the fast axial jet and the wider molecular CO outflow to discriminate between the different scenarios at their origin (irradiated/shocked disk wind or swept-up material). Using observations from JWST NIRSpec-IFU, NIRCam and SINFONI/VLT, we investigate the morphology, kinematics and excitation conditions of H$_2$ emission lines of the red-shifted outflow lobe. We find an onion-like structure of the outflows with increasing temperature, velocity and collimation towards the flow axis. The red-shifted H$_2$ emission reveals a narrow conical cavity nested inside the CO outflow and originating from the inner disk regions (&lt; 6 au). The H$_2$ shell exhibits a constant vertical velocity ($\simeq$22 km/s), twice faster that of the CO flow and an average mass flux of $\dot{M}$(H$_2$) = 3e-11 M$_\odot$/yr significantly lower than the jet and CO values, suggesting low H$_2$ abundance. The global layered structure of the H$_2$/CO outflows is consistent with an MHD disk wind scenario, with the hot H$_2$ possibly tracing an inner dense photodissociation layer of the wind coming from a launching radius in the disk of 0.2-0.4 au. Further analysis, including MIRI observations will provide additional insights into the H$_2$ excitation mechanisms and the origin of the layered outflows observed in DG Tau B.</description>

      <title>Imaging spectroscopy of spectral bump in a type II radio burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observations of solar type II radio bursts provide a unique opportunity to analyze the non-thermal electrons accelerated by coronal shocks and also to diagnose the plasma density distribution in the corona. However, there are very rare high-frequency resolution interferometric observations for type II radio bursts that are capable of tracking these electrons.
  Aims. Recently, more spatially resolved high-resolution observations of type II radio bursts have been recorded with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). Using these observations, we aim to track the location of a type II radio burst that experiences a sudden spectral bump.
  Methods. Here, we present the first radio imaging observations for a type II burst with a spectral bump. We measure the variation in source location and frequency drift of the type II burst, and deduct the density distribution along its propagation direction.
  Results. We identified a type II burst that experiences a sudden spectral bump in its frequency-time profile. The overall frequency drift rate is 0.06 MHz/s and it corresponds to an estimated speed of 295 km/s. The projected speed of the radio source obtained from imaging is 380 km/s towards the east direction. At the spectral bump, a deviation in the source locations of the type II split bands is observed. The band separation increases significantly in the north-south direction.
  Conclusions. The spectral bump shows an 8 MHz deviation at 60 MHz which corresponds to a 25% decrease in the plasma density. The estimated crossing distance during the spectrum bump in type II is 29 Mm suggesting that this density variation occurs in a confined area. This indicates that the shock most likely encounters the upper extent of a coronal hole.</description>

      <title>UVIT/AstroSat observation of TW Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates the spectroscopic and photometric capabilities of the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to study T-Tauri stars (TTSs). We present the first UVIT/Far-UV spectrum of a TTS, TW Hya. Based on C IV line luminosity, we estimated accretion luminosity (0.1 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (2.2 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) of TW Hya, and compared these values with the accretion luminosity (0.03 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (0.6 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) derived from spectral energy distribution (SED). From the SED, we derive best-fitted parameters for TW Hya: $T_{eff}$ = 3900$\pm$50 K, radius = 1.2$\pm$0.03 $R_\odot$, $\mathrm{log}\, g = 4.0$ and equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to accretion luminosity as 14100$\pm$25 K. The parameters of TW Hya derived from UVIT observations were found to be matched well with the literature. Comparison with IUE spectra also suggests that UVIT can be used to study the spectroscopic variability of young stars. This study proposes leveraging the FUV spectroscopic capabilities of UVIT to contribute to the advancement of upcoming UV spectroscopic missions, including the Indian Spectroscopic Imaging Space Telescope (INSIST).</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Flaring Transients Following Supernova Explosions in Black-Hole Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems, a fraction of which is expected to remain bound after the first star goes off as a supernova. When the second star also explodes, the SN ejecta are bound to interact with the compact object companion. We explore the consequences of this interaction in the case of a black hole (BH) companion. We show that accretion of the SN ejecta by the BH generally occurs with highly super-Eddington rates, which can be strongly modulated if the ejecta are clumpy, as typically observed in supernova remnants. This late accretion produces transient flaring activity with a time delay from the SN explosion of days to months, depending on the orbital separation and the velocity of the ejecta. The flares are expected to have a non-thermal, broad band spectrum, but their high-frequency emission (UV and X-rays) would be absorbed within the remnant. Observed flares should therefore be in the optical and near-infrared. We propose this model as an explanation to the late-time flaring activity observed in the fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae have become increasingly mature and important in recent years. Magnetic fields take center stage in scenarios for explaining hypernova explosions, but are now also considered in supernova theory more broadly as an important factor even in neutrino-driven explosions, especially in the context of neutron star birth properties. Here we present an overview of simulation approaches currently used for magnetohydrodynamic supernova simulations and sketch essential physical concepts for understanding the role of magnetic fields in supernovae of slowly or rapidly rotating massive stars. We review progress on simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae, magnetorotational supernovae, and the relevant field amplification processes. Recent results on the nucleosynthesis and gravitational wave emission from magnetorotational supernovae are also discussed. We highlight efforts to provide better initial conditions for magnetohydrodynamic supernova models by simulating short phases of the progenitor evolution in 3D to address uncertainties in the treatment of rotation and magnetic fields in current stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>The phase curve of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-167b as seen by TESS</title>

Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) orbiting pulsating A/F stars represent an important subset of the exoplanetary demographic, as they are excellent candidates for the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, as well as being astrophysical laboratories for the investigation of planet-to-star interactions. We analyse the \texttt{TESS} (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curve of the WASP-167 system, consisting of an F1V star and a substellar companion on a $\sim 2.02$ day orbit. We model the combination of the ellipsoidal variability and the Doppler beaming to measure the mass of WASP-167b, and the reflection effect to obtain constraints on the geometric albedo, while placing a special emphasis on noise separation. We implement a basic model to determine the dayside ($T_{\rm Day}$), nightside ($T_{\rm Night}$) and intrinsic ($T_{\rm Internal}$) temperatures of WASP-167b and put a constraint on its Bond albedo. We confirm the transit parameters of the planet seen in the literature. We find that a resonant $\sim 2P^{-1}$ stellar signal (which may originate from planet-to-star interactions) interferes with the phase curve analysis. After considerate treatment of this signal, we find $M_p = 0.34 \pm 0.22$~$M_J$. We measure a dayside temperature of $2790 \pm 100$ K, classifying WASP-167b as an UHJ. We find a $2\sigma$ upper limit of $0.51$ on its Bond albedo, and determine the geometric albedo at $0.34 \pm 0.11$ ($1 \sigma$ uncertainty). With an occultation depth of $106.8 \pm 27.3$ ppm in the \texttt{TESS} passband, the UHJ WASP-167b will be an excellent target for atmospheric studies, especially those at thermal wavelength ranges, where the stellar pulsations are expected to be be less influential.</description>

      <title>VLBI detection of nearby (&lt; 100 pc) young stars: Pilot observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To increase the number of sources with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry available for comparison with the Gaia results, we have observed 31 young stars with recently reported radio emission. These stars are all in the Gaia DR3 catalog and were suggested, on the basis of conventional interferometry observations, to be non-thermal radio emitters and, therefore, good candidates for VLBI detections. The observations were carried out with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at two epochs separated by a few days and yielded 10 detections (a $\sim$30\% detection rate). Using the astrometric Gaia results, we have extrapolated the target positions to the epochs of our radio observations and compared them with the position of the radio sources. For seven objects, the optical and radio positions are coincident within five times their combined position errors. Three targets, however, have position discrepancies above eight times the position errors, indicating different emitting sources at optical and radio wavelengths. In one case, the VLBA emission is very likely associated with a known companion of the primary target. In the other two cases, we associate the VLBA emission with previously unknown companions, but further observations will be needed to confirm this.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar accretion rates from $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$ emission lines with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we present the first systematic spectroscopic measurements of the Near-InfraRed (NIR) hydrogen recombination lines Paschen alpha ($Pa_{\alpha}$ $\lambda = 1.875 \mu m$) and Brackett beta ($Br_{\beta}$ $\lambda = 2.626 \mu m$), produced by pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. These stars, consisting of T Tauri and Herbig AeBe stars are located in the massive Galactic star-formation region NGC 3603. The measurements were obtained from JWST NIRSpec, using multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode. Utilising existing empirical relations between $L_{acc}$ and $L_{Br_{\gamma}}$, we have used our new measurements to formulate, for the first time, an empirical relationship between the accretion luminosity $L_{acc}$ of the stars, and the line luminosities $L_{line}$ of both $Pa_{\alpha}$ and $Br_{\beta}$. These relationships are: $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.42 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Pa_{\alpha}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 3.33 (\pm 0.42)$ and $\log_{10}( \frac{L_{acc}}{L_{\odot}}) = 1.47 (\pm 0.18) \times \log_{10}( \frac{L_{Br_{\beta}}}{L_{\odot}}) + 4.60 (\pm 0.57)$. These new relationships are key for roughly estimating the accretion rates for large samples of PMS stars with JWST.</description>
