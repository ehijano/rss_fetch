      <title>Characterizing the Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entertainment-driven dynamics of social media platforms encourage users to engage with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with their beliefs. These dynamics may amplify polarization by reinforcing shared perspectives and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, users migrate from one platform to another, either forced by moderation policies, such as de-platforming, or spontaneously seeking environments more aligned with their preferences. These migrations foster the specialization and differentiation of the social media ecosystem, with platforms increasingly organized around specific user communities and shared content preferences. This shift marks an evolution from echo chambers enclosed within platforms to "echo platforms", i.e., entire platforms functioning as ideologically homogeneous niches. This study introduces an operational framework to systematically analyze these dynamics, by examining three key dimensions: platform centrality (central vs. peripheral), news consumption (reliable vs questionable), and user base composition (uniform vs diverse). To this aim, we leverage a dataset of 126M URLs posted by nearly 6M users on nine social media platforms, namely Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (now X), YouTube, BitChute, Gab, Parler, Scored, and Voat. We find a clear separation between mainstream and alt-tech platforms, with the second category being characterized by a peripheral role in the social media ecosystem, a greater prevalence of unreliable content, and a heightened ideological uniformity. These findings outline the main dimensions defining the fragmentation and polarization of the social media ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Network Formation Model Based on Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.07658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new class of random graph models for the statistical estimation of network formation -- subgraph generated models (SUGMs). Various subgraphs -- e.g., links, triangles, cliques, stars -- are generated and their union results in a network. We show that SUGMs are identified and establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of parameter estimators in empirically relevant cases. We show that a simple four-parameter SUGM matches basic patterns in empirical networks more closely than four standard models (with many more dimensions): (i) stochastic block models; (ii) models with node-level unobserved heterogeneity; (iii) latent space models; (iv) exponential random graphs. We illustrate the framework's value via several applications using networks from rural India. We study whether network structure helps enforce risk-sharing and whether cross-caste interactions are more likely to be private. We also develop a new central limit theorem for correlated random variables, which is required to prove our results and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Comment on Lubineau et al. (2023) 'Does word flickering improve reading? Negative evidence from four experiments using low and high frequencies'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.</description>
