      <title>Astronomical outreach and education in marginalised and indigenous communities: astronomy as a tool for social development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way we look at the sky is connected to the cosmological paradigm embraced by the society we live in. On the other hand, several astronomical concepts reinforce the idea of a common humanity. Yet, scientific outreach is frequenty reaching out only to a specific part of the world population, often excluding people living in extreme social vulnerability, victims of violence and prejudice, fighting for their lives and for the right of living according to their traditions. We present two outreach projects, developed in Brazil, funded by the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), i.e. 'Under Other Skies' and 'OruMbya', which tackle the importance of ethno-astronomy, and the collaboration with leaders and cultural agents of marginalised communities. We also describe an educational project born in the favela of Cantagalo Pav\~ao Pava\~azinho (PPG), in Rio de Janeiro, during the COVID19 pandemic, which started a collaboration with local educators and artists to offer classes of astronomy and English language to children in the favela</description>

      <title>How time and pollster history affect U.S. election forecasts under a compartmental modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the months leading up to political elections in the United States, forecasts are widespread and take on multiple forms, including projections of what party will win the popular vote, state ratings, and predictions of vote margins at the state level. It can be challenging to evaluate how accuracy changes in the lead up to Election Day or to put probabilistic forecasts into historical context. Moreover, forecasts differ between analysts, highlighting the many choices in the forecasting process. With this as motivation, here we take a more comprehensive view and begin to unpack some of the choices involved in election forecasting. Building on a prior compartmental model of election dynamics, we present the forecasts of this model across months, years, and types of race. By gathering together monthly forecasts of presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial races from 2004--2022, we provide a larger-scale perspective and discuss how treating polling data in different ways affects forecast accuracy. We conclude with our 2024 election forecasts (upcoming at the time of writing).</description>

      <title>Measuring the Variability of Outcomes of the New Natural Daylighting Requirements in the Basque Country's Habitability Decree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Basque Country's Habitability Decree of 2022 redefines natural lighting requirements in residential spaces, increasing the Wall-to-Floor Ratio (WFR) compared to previous municipal and sectoral standards, based on the depth of the space considered. This regulatory adjustment seeks to optimize the quality of natural light, a key factor for well-being. However, the application of a geometric rule based on fixed proportions raises questions about the variability of achievable lighting results and their suitability for residential comfort needs. This study analyses the implementation of the regulation in two bedroom models, BR1 and BR2, selected as the typical and the deepest, but with less than 4 meters and meeting the rest of the dimensional requirements, respectively. Through simulations of the Daylight Factor (DF) using window proportions of 1:1, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:2 under a CIE overcast sky model, the dispersion in the obtained natural lighting has been examined. Such analysis allows for the quantification of lighting result variability within the regulatory parameters, exploring the complexity of meeting lighting requirements through an approach based exclusively on geometric proportions. Additionally, the impact of architectural and urban variables such as building height, the presence of courtyards, street width, and balcony depth has been considered. These factors, often overlooked in regulations and indirectly considered in D80/2022, play an important role in modulating natural light and lighting quality. At the end, the paper comments on the advantages and limitations of regulating natural light through arithmetic or geometric rules like the WFR, comparing this method with approaches based on detailed room-by-room analysis.</description>

      <title>Kinetic exchange opinion dynamics for the battleground-states in the 2024 US presidential elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly polarizing political discourse in the U. S. implies that a small minority of the population, determining the outcome of the presidential elections in a few so called battleground-states, also determines the outcome of the overall election. Given the almost equal distributions of the electoral college members in the so-called blue and red states, the members elected from these battleground states would determine the election results. We build a kinetic exchange opinion model that takes into account the dynamical nature of the opinions of the individuals in the battleground states and the already determined core voters of the non-battleground states. In a fully connected graph, we consider the interaction among the population in the battleground states while the agents in the non-battleground states are assumed to have fixed opinions. We provide the analytical results and numerical simulations using realistic parameters from the opinion poll of the previous election's data. Counter-intuitively, a more noisy environment predicts a higher chance of the Democrats' win.</description>

      <title>Identifiability analysis of vaccination decision-making dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations in individuals' perceptions of vaccination and decision-making processes can give rise to poor vaccination coverage. The future vaccination promotion programs will benefit from understanding this heterogeneity amongst groups within a population and, accordingly, tailoring the communication strategies. Motivated by this, we developed a mechanistic model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations that
  categorizes individuals based on two factors: (i) perceived payoff gains for vaccination and (ii} decision-making strategies where we assumed that individuals may behave as either myopic rationalists, going for a dose of vaccine if doing so maximizes their perceived payoff gain, or success-based learners, waiting to observe feedback on vaccination before deciding.
  We then investigated the global identifiability of group proportions and perceived payoff gains, that is, the possibility of globally retrieving these parameters by observing the error-free cumulative proportion of vaccinated individuals over time.
  To do so, for each group, we assumed a piecewise constant payoff gain and, for each time interval, obtained the so-called generalized input-output equation. We then proved the global identifiability of these parameters under certain conditions.
  Global identifiability opens the door to reliable estimations of the group proportions and their perceived payoffs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the MBTI distribution among Chinese undergraduate physics students: the influence of family income on career trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the distribution of MBTI personality types among physics undergraduates at Zhejiang University and analyzed their career aspirations, family income and mental health status. A comprehensive survey of 68 questions, including 52 multiple-choice questions and 16 short-answer questions, assessed various personality traits and their correlation with academic intent and emotional state. The results showed that INTJ and INTP personality types showed the most significant tendency to pursue academic research. They usually come from middle and above-class backgrounds. Notably, these two personality types accounted for about 41\% of the total surveyed population, while NT types combined accounted for about 58\%. This indicates that although NT personality is more suitable for academic research, students with introverted tendencies are more suitable. Research has further shown that people with ISTJ personalities often exhibit unexpectedly strong academic interests. In addition, individuals who aspire to enter academia generally maintain a stable state of mind, as evidenced by their consistent work efficiency in the face of personal challenges. Interestingly, although some aspiring academics come from financially stable families, most have encountered financial constraints. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how personality traits and socioeconomic factors influence the academic career paths of physics students.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimensions $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Vehicles, Pedestrians, and E-bikes: a Three-party Game at Right-turn-on-red Crossroads Revealing the Dual and Irrational Role of E-bikes that Risks Traffic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of e-bikes has facilitated short-distance travel yet led to confusion and safety problems in road traffic. This study focuses on the dual characteristics of e-bikes in traffic conflicts: they resemble pedestrians when interacting with motor vehicles and behave like motor vehicles when in conflict with pedestrians, which raises the right of way concerns when potential conflicts are at stake. Using the Quantal Response Equilibrium model, this research analyzes the behavioral choice differences of three groups of road users (vehicle-pedestrian, vehicle-e-bike, e-bike-pedestrian) at right-turn-on-red crossroads in right-turning lines and straight-going lines conflict scenarios. The results show that the behavior of e-bikes is more similar to that of motor vehicles than pedestrians overall, and their interactions with either pedestrians or motor vehicles do not establish a reasonable order, increasing the likelihood of confusion and conflict. In contrast, a mutual understanding has developed between motor vehicles and pedestrians, where motor vehicles tend to yield, and pedestrians tend to cross. By clarifying the game theoretical model and introducing the rationality parameter, this study precisely locates the role of e-bikes among road users, which provides a reliable theoretical basis for optimizing traffic regulations.</description>

      <title>Network community detection via neural embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning research have produced powerful neural graph embedding methods, which learn useful, low-dimensional vector representations of network data. These neural methods for graph embedding excel in graph machine learning tasks and are now widely adopted. However, how and why these methods work -- particularly how network structure gets encoded in the embedding -- remain largely unexplained. Here, we show that node2vec -- shallow, linear neural network -- encodes communities into separable clusters better than random partitioning down to the information-theoretic detectability limit for the stochastic block models. We show that this is due to the equivalence between the embedding learned by node2vec and the spectral embedding via the eigenvectors of the symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix. Numerical simulations demonstrate that node2vec is capable of learning communities on sparse graphs generated by the stochastic blockmodel, as well as on sparse degree-heterogeneous networks. Our results highlight the features of graph neural networks that enable them to separate communities in embedding space.</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum entanglement in visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent development in purely perception based models of collective motion using perception vectors, we suggest a quantum-inspired model of collective behaviour. We investigate the alignment of self-propelled agents by introducing quantum entanglement in the perceptual states of neighboring agents within each agent's vision cone. In this framework, we propose that the force acting on active agents is proportional to the quantum expectation value of perception operator encoding perceptual dynamics that drives alignment within the flock. Additionally, we introduce two quantum mechanical measures-perception strength and perceptual energy-to characterize collective behavior. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of the entangled state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into swarm intelligence and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from entangled perceptual states.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Network Influence: Social Influence Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.09072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding network influence and its determinants are key challenges in political science and network analysis. Traditional latent variable models position actors within a social space based on network dependencies but often do not elucidate the underlying factors driving these interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Social Influence Regression (SIR) model, an extension of vector autoregression tailored for relational data that incorporates exogenous covariates into the estimation of influence patterns. The SIR model captures influence dynamics via a pair of $n \times n$ matrices that quantify how the actions of one actor affect the future actions of another. This framework not only provides a statistical mechanism for explaining actor influence based on observable traits but also improves computational efficiency through an iterative block coordinate descent method. We showcase the SIR model's capabilities by applying it to monthly conflict events between countries, using data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Our findings demonstrate the SIR model's ability to elucidate complex influence patterns within networks by linking them to specific covariates. This paper's main contributions are: (1) introducing a model that explains third-order dependencies through exogenous covariates and (2) offering an efficient estimation approach that scales effectively with large, complex networks.</description>
