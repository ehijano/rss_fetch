      <title>Fabrication-Aware Inverse Design For Shape Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design (ID) is a computational method that systematically explores a design space to find optimal device geometries based on specific performance criteria. In silicon photonics, ID often leads to devices with design features that degrade significantly due to the fabrication process, limiting the applicability of these devices in scalable silicon photonic fabrication. We demonstrate a solution to this performance degradation through fabrication-aware inverse design (FAID), integrating lithography models for deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography and electron beam lithography (EBL) into the shape optimization approach of ID. A Y-branch and an SWG-to-strip converter were generated and fabricated with this new approach. Simulated and measured results verify that the FAID yields devices with up to 0.6 dB lower insertion loss per device. The modified workflow enables designers to use ID to generate devices that adjust for process bias predicted by lithography models.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Shielding for Safe Autonomy under Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shielding is a common method used to guarantee the safety of a system under a black-box controller, such as a neural network controller from deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with simpler, verified controllers. Existing shielding methods rely on formal verification through Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), assuming either known or finite-state models, which limits their applicability to DRL settings with unknown, continuous-state systems. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a data-driven shielding methodology that guarantees safety for unknown systems under black-box controllers. The approach leverages Deep Kernel Learning to model the systems' one-step evolution with uncertainty quantification and constructs a finite-state abstraction as an Interval MDP (IMDP). By focusing on safety properties expressed in safe linear temporal logic (safe LTL), we develop an algorithm that computes the maximally permissive set of safe policies on the IMDP, ensuring avoidance of unsafe states. The algorithms soundness and computational complexity are demonstrated through theoretical proofs and experiments on nonlinear systems, including a high-dimensional autonomous spacecraft scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning responsibility allocations for multi-agent interactions: A differentiable optimization approach with control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From autonomous driving to package delivery, ensuring safe yet efficient multi-agent interaction is challenging as the interaction dynamics are influenced by hard-to-model factors such as social norms and contextual cues. Understanding these influences can aid in the design and evaluation of socially-aware autonomous agents whose behaviors are aligned with human values. In this work, we seek to codify factors governing safe multi-agent interactions via the lens of responsibility, i.e., an agent's willingness to deviate from their desired control to accommodate safe interaction with others. Specifically, we propose a data-driven modeling approach based on control barrier functions and differentiable optimization that efficiently learns agents' responsibility allocation from data. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that we can obtain an interpretable and quantitative understanding of how much agents adjust their behavior to ensure the safety of others given their current environment.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of High Efficiency Single-stage Electromagnetic Coil Guns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents several novel approaches to improve the efficiency of a single-stage coil gun. Conventional designs typically feature a uniformly wound solenoid and a ferrite projectile. For our research, we constructed a microcontroller-based prototype to test several new enhancements, including the use of a bipolar current pulse, a stepped multilayer coil with non-uniform winding densities, and the replacement of conventional ferrite projectiles with a neodymium permanent magnet. These modifications were designed to reduce energy loss and improve projectile acceleration by changing magnetic field strength and effectively controlling the magnetic flux. The experimental results show that the proposed methods resulted in significant efficiency improvements, with the varying current pulse and stepped coil design providing enhanced magnetic force at key points in the projectile's path, and the permanent magnet projectile contributing to higher velocities and efficiencies by leveraging the current pulses. Our findings suggest that combining these enhancements significantly improves coil gun performance, achieving higher velocities and efficiencies. These findings can be applied to future coil gun developments, such as multi-stage coil gun systems.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Grid Storage on Balancing Costs and Carbon Emissions in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid energy storage can help to balance supply and demand, but its financial viability and operational carbon emissions impact is poorly understood because of the complexity of grid constraints and market outcomes. We analyse the impact of several technologies (Li-ion and flow batteries, pumped hydro, hydrogen) on Great Britain balancing mechanism, the main market for supply-demand balancing and congestion management. We find that, for many locations and technologies, financially optimal operation of storage for balancing can result in higher carbon emissions. For example, the extra emissions associated with a 1 MW 2-hour duration Li-ion battery in winter vary between +230 to -71 kgCO2/h. Although storage enable higher usage of renewables, it can also unlock additional demand leading to greater use of gas. In addition, balancing services alone are presently insufficient for financial viability of storage projects. This work highlights the need for market reform aligning financial incentives with environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Reachability Analysis for Black-Box Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful framework for ensuring safety and performance in autonomous systems. However, existing methods typically rely on a white-box dynamics model of the system, limiting their applicability in many practical robotics scenarios where only a black-box model of the system is available. In this work, we propose a novel reachability method to compute reachable sets and safe controllers for black-box dynamical systems. Our approach efficiently approximates the Hamiltonian function using samples from the black-box dynamics. This Hamiltonian is then used to solve the HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE), providing the reachable set of the system. The proposed method can be applied to general nonlinear systems and can be seamlessly integrated with existing reachability toolboxes for white-box systems to extend their use to black-box systems. Through simulation studies on a black-box slip-wheel car and a quadruped robot, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately obtaining the reachable sets for black?box dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A four-bodies motorcycle dynamic model for observer design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to predict dangerous scenarios, this article introduces a non-linear dynamic model for motorcycles consisting of four rigid bodies. Using Jourdain's principle, the model incorporates both longitudinal and lateral dynamics, targeting a balance between numerical complexity and accuracy of representation. The paper further employs the model to design a Luenberger observer based on linear quadratic regulator theory, for estimating physical states based on sensor measurements. In turn, the state estimates are useful for predicting dangerous scenarios (lowside, highside, fall). The relevance of the approach is demonstrated through simulations of various rectilinear trajectories and a lane-changing scenario using BikeSim simulator.</description>

      <title>Sensor-Based Safety-Critical Control using an Incremental Control Barrier Function Formulation via Reduced-Order Approximate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing control barrier function literature generally relies on precise mathematical models to guarantee system safety, limiting their applicability in scenarios with parametric uncertainties. While incremental control techniques have shown promise in addressing model uncertainties in flight control applications, translating these approaches to safety-critical control presents significant challenges. This paper bridges this gap by introducing measurement robust incremental control barrier functions (MRICBFs), which leverage sensor-based reduced-order models to provide formal safety guarantees for uncertain systems. By carefully addressing the challenges of sensor accuracy and approximation errors in the incremental formulation, our approach enables substituting specific model components with real-time sensor measurements while maintaining rigorous safety guarantees. This formulation overcomes the limitations of traditional adaptive control methods that adjust system parameters over time, enabling immediate and reliable safety measures for a particular class of model uncertainties. The efficacy of MRICBFs is demonstrated in two simulation case studies: a simple first-order system with time-varying sensor biases and a more complex overactuated hypersonic glide vehicle with multiple state constraints.</description>

      <title>State Feedback System Level Synthesis in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System level synthesis (SLS) is a controller parameterization technique that facilitates distributed structured control via convex techniques. Results on SLS are primarily in the discrete-time setting; this paper extends SLS to the continuous-time setting. We translate the parametrization and associated constraints to continuous time, and propose a controller design procedure consisting of two steps: (1) pole selection and (2) optimization over closed-loops. We provide SLS reformulations of H2 and Hinf control, and show that the proposed procedure allows for convex design of structured H2 and Hinf controllers. We verify our methods in simulation on a grid of linearized swing equations. The resulting structured (i.e. sparse) controllers perform similarly (in some cases within 1\% cost) as the centralized (i.e. dense) controllers. The proposed procedure preserves the scalability and disturbance-rejection features of the original discrete-time SLS framework.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Input-to-State Stable Stochastic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing model predictive control to systems with unbounded, stochastic disturbances poses the challenge of guaranteeing safety, i.e., repeated feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system. Especially, there are no strict repeated feasibility guarantees for standard stochastic MPC formulations. Thus, traditional stability proofs are not straightforwardly applicable. We exploit the concept of input-to-state stability in probability and outline how it can be used to provide stability guarantees, circumventing the requirement for strict repeated feasibility guarantees. Loss of feasibility is captured by a back-up controller, which is explicitly taken into account in the stability analysis. We illustrate our findings using a numeric example.</description>

      <title>Comparing Mass-Preserving Numerical Methods for the Lithium-Ion Battery Single Particle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single particle model (SPM) is a reduced electrochemical model that holds promise for applications in battery management systems due to its ability to accurately capture battery dynamics; however, the numerical discretization of the SPM requires careful consideration to ensure numerical stability and accuracy. In this paper, we present a comparative study of two mass-preserving numerical schemes for the SPM: the finite volume method and the control volume method. Using numerical simulations, we systematically evaluate the performance of these schemes, after independently calibrating the SPM discretized with each scheme to experimental data, and find a tradeoff between accuracy (quantified by voltage root-mean-square error) and computational time. Our findings provide insights into the selection of numerical schemes for the SPM, contributing to the advancement of battery modeling and simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Model Reference Computed Torque Control Strategy for Human Lower Limb Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoskeleton robots have become a promising tool in neurorehabilitation, offering effective physical therapy and recovery monitoring. The success of these therapies relies on precise motion control systems. Although computed torque control based on inverse dynamics provides a robust theoretical foundation, its practical application in rehabilitation is limited by its sensitivity to model accuracy, making it less effective when dealing with unpredictable payloads. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel model reference computed torque controller that accounts for parametric uncertainties while optimizing computational efficiency. A dynamic model of a seven-degree-of-freedom human lower limb exoskeleton is developed, incorporating a realistic joint friction model to accurately reflect the physical behavior of the robot. To reduce computational demands, the control system is split into two loops: a slower loop that predicts joint torque requirements based on input trajectories and robot dynamics, and a faster PID loop that corrects trajectory tracking errors. Coriolis and centrifugal forces are excluded from the model due to their minimal impact on system dynamics relative to their computational cost. Experimental results show high accuracy in trajectory tracking, and statistical analyses confirm the controller's robustness and effectiveness in handling parametric uncertainties. This approach presents a promising advancement for improving the stability and performance of exoskeleton-based neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batteryless IoT devices, powered by energy harvesting, face significant challenges in maintaining operational efficiency and reliability due to intermittent power availability. Traditional checkpointing mechanisms, while essential for preserving computational state, introduce considerable energy and time overheads. This paper introduces Approxify, an automated framework that significantly enhances the sustainability and performance of batteryless IoT networks by reducing energy consumption by approximately 40% through intelligent approximation techniques. \tool balances energy efficiency with computational accuracy, ensuring reliable operation without compromising essential functionalities. Our evaluation of applications, SUSAN and Link Quality Indicator (LQI), demonstrates significant reductions in checkpoint frequency and energy usage while maintaining acceptable error bounds.</description>

      <title>Evaluating internal and external dissonance of belief dynamics in social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belief dynamics are fundamental to human behavior and social coordination. Individuals rely on accurate beliefs to make decisions, and shared beliefs form the basis of successful cooperation. Traditional studies often examined beliefs in isolation, but recent perspectives suggest beliefs operate as interconnected systems, both within individuals and across social networks. To better understand belief dynamics, we propose an extension of Galesic et al.'s model, which allows individuals to weigh internal and social dissonance based on belief certainty. Our model suggests that belief convergence occurs in two patterns: internal alignment, where beliefs become ideologically consistent but socially disagreeable, or social alignment, where beliefs become socially consistent but internally varied. These results highlight a competition between internal and social belief networks, with one network often dominating. Our findings suggest that belief dynamics tend to settle at extremes, indicating a need for future models to incorporate negative feedback to reflect more nuanced societal belief changes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Attitude Control of Large Flexible Space Structures with Distributed Momentum Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent spacecraft mission concepts propose larger payloads that have lighter, less rigid structures. For large lightweight structures, the natural frequencies of their vibration modes may fall within the attitude controller bandwidth, threatening the stability and settling time of the controller and compromising performance. This work tackles this issue by proposing an attitude control design paradigm of distributing momentum actuators throughout the structure to have more control authority over vibration modes. The issue of jitter disturbances introduced by these actuators is addressed by expanding the bandwidth of the attitude controller to suppress excess vibrations. Numerical simulation results show that, at the expense of more control action, a distributed configuration can achieve lower settling times and reduce structural deformation compared to a more standard centralized configuration.</description>

      <title>A Rapid Trajectory Optimization and Control Framework for Resource-Constrained Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient model predictive control formulation that uses an integral Chebyshev collocation method to enable rapid operations of autonomous agents. By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance.

      <title>Simulating the blood transfusion system in Kenya: Modelling methods and exploratory analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of collecting blood from donors and making it available for transfusion requires a complex series of operations involving multiple actors and resources at each step. Ensuring hospitals receive adequate and safe blood for transfusion is a common challenge across low- and middle-income countries, but is rarely addressed from a system level. This paper presents the first use of discrete event simulation to study the blood system in Kenya and to explore the effect of variations and perturbations at different steps of the system on meeting patient blood demand. A process map of the Kenyan blood system was developed to capture critical steps from blood donation to transfusion using interviews with blood bank, hospital, and laboratory personnel at four public hospitals across three counties in Kenya. The blood system was simulated starting with blood collection, a blood bank where blood is tested and stored before it is issued, a major hospital attached to the blood bank, and several smaller hospitals served by the same blood bank. Values for supply-side parameters were based mainly on expert opinion; demand-side parameters were based on data from blood requisitions made in hospital wards, and dispatch of blood from the hospital laboratory. Illustrative examples demonstrate how the model can be used to explore the impacts of changes in blood collection (e.g., prioritising different donor types), blood demand (e.g., differing clinical case mix), and blood distribution (e.g., restocking strategies) on meeting demand at patient level. The model can reveal potential process impediments in the blood system and aid in choosing strategies for improving blood collection, distribution or use. Such a systems approach allows for interventions at different steps in the blood continuum to be tested on blood availability for different patients presenting at diverse hospitals across the country.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic System with Optical Coherence Tomography Guidance for Vascular Anastomosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular anastomosis, the surgical connection of blood vessels, is essential in procedures such as organ transplants and reconstructive surgeries. The precision required limits accessibility due to the extensive training needed, with manual suturing leading to variable outcomes and revision rates up to 7.9%. Existing robotic systems, while promising, are either fully teleoperated or lack the capabilities necessary for autonomous vascular anastomosis. We present the Micro Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (micro-STAR), an autonomous robotic system designed to perform vascular anastomosis on small-diameter vessels. The micro-STAR system integrates a novel suturing tool equipped with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) fiber-optic sensor and a microcamera, enabling real-time tissue detection and classification. Our system autonomously places sutures and manipulates tissue with minimal human intervention. In an ex vivo study, micro-STAR achieved outcomes competitive with experienced surgeons in terms of leak pressure, lumen reduction, and suture placement variation, completing 90% of sutures without human intervention. This represents the first instance of a robotic system autonomously performing vascular anastomosis on real tissue, offering significant potential for improving surgical precision and expanding access to high-quality care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop improved physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for high-order and high-dimensional power system models described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We propose some novel enhancements to improve PINN training and accuracy and also implement several other recently proposed ideas from the literature. We successfully apply these to study the transient dynamics of synchronous generators. We also make progress towards applying PINNs to advanced inverter models. Such enhanced PINNs can allow us to accelerate high-fidelity simulations needed to ensure a stable and reliable renewables-rich future grid.</description>

      <title>Parallel Digital Twin-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for User Association and Load Balancing in Dynamic Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of user association in a densely deployed heterogeneous cellular network is usually challenging and even more complicated due to the dynamic nature of user mobility and fluctuation in user counts. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. In addition, existing DRL-based user association methods are usually only applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. In this paper, we propose a parallel digital twin (DT)-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with both dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. Our method employs a distributed DRL strategy to handle varying user numbers and exploits a refined neural network structure for faster convergence. To address these DRL training-related challenges, we devise a high-fidelity DT construction technique, featuring a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on a diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. Armed with this DT environment, DRL agents are enabled to be trained without the need for interactions with the physical network. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve the training efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed parallel DT-driven DRL method achieves closely comparable performance to real environment training, and even outperforms those trained in a single real-world environment with nearly 20% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</description>

      <title>A Visual Cooperative Localization Method for Airborne Magnetic Surveying Based on a Manifold Sensor Fusion Algorithm Using Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in UAV technology have spurred interest in developing multi-UAV aerial surveying systems for use in confined environments where GNSS signals are blocked or jammed. This paper focuses airborne magnetic surveying scenarios. To obtain clean magnetic measurements reflecting the Earth's magnetic field, the magnetic sensor must be isolated from other electronic devices, creating a significant localization challenge. We propose a visual cooperative localization solution. The solution incorporates a visual processing module and an improved manifold-based sensor fusion algorithm, delivering reliable and accurate positioning information. Real flight experiments validate the approach, demonstrating single-axis centimeter-level accuracy and decimeter-level overall 3D positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>PHODCOS: Pythagorean Hodograph-based Differentiable Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents PHODCOS, an algorithm that assigns a moving coordinate system to a given curve. The parametric functions underlying the coordinate system, i.e., the path function, the moving frame and its angular velocity, are exact -- approximation free -- differentiable, and sufficiently continuous. This allows for computing a coordinate system for highly nonlinear curves, while remaining compliant with autonomous navigation algorithms that require first and second order gradient information. In addition, the coordinate system obtained by PHODCOS is fully defined by a finite number of coefficients, which may then be used to compute additional geometric properties of the curve, such as arc-length, curvature, torsion, etc. Therefore, PHODCOS presents an appealing paradigm to enhance the geometrical awareness of existing guidance and navigation on-orbit spacecraft maneuvers. The PHODCOS algorithm is presented alongside an analysis of its error and approximation order, and thus, it is guaranteed that the obtained coordinate system matches the given curve within a desired tolerance. To demonstrate the applicability of the coordinate system resulting from PHODCOS, we present numerical examples in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) for the Lunar Gateway.</description>

      <title>Robotic framework for autonomous manipulation of laboratory equipment with different degrees of transparency via 6D pose estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.</description>

      <title>Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge. Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms. In this work, we propose OHIO: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the inverse problem, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy. This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training. We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness. We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed.</description>

      <title>Eco-driving Incentive Mechanisms for Mitigating Emissions in Urban Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes incentive mechanisms that promote eco-driving in transportation networks with the over-arching objective of minimizing emissions. The transportation system operator provides the drivers with energy-efficient driving guidance throughout their trips, and their eco-driving levels are measured by how closely they follow this guidance via vehicle telematics. Drivers choose their eco-driving levels to optimize a combination of their travel times and their emissions. To obtain optimal budget allocation and recommendations for the incentive mechanism, the system operator gathers drivers' preferences, or types, to assess each driver's trip urgency and natural willingness to eco-drive. In a setting where drivers truthfully report their types, we introduce the first-best incentive mechanism and show that the obedience condition holds (i.e., drivers find it optimal to comply with the system operator's recommendations) when the recommended eco-driving profile constitutes a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, in a setting where drivers can strategically report their types, we introduce the second-best incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism is incentive-compatible (i.e., drivers find it optimal to be truthful). Under this mechanism, we also show that all equilibrium outcomes are at least as good as the recommended eco-driving profile in terms of the system operator's objective. Overall, this work offers a framework for designing eco-driving incentive mechanisms while considering both the strategic behavior of individual drivers and the network effects of collective decision-making.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Policy-Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance and scalability through comprehensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Optimization via Quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimization methods exhibit fast convergence to critical points, however, in nonconvex optimization, these methods often require restrictive step-sizes to ensure a monotonically decreasing objective function. In the presence of highly nonlinear objective functions with large Lipschitz constants, increasingly small step-sizes become a bottleneck to fast convergence. We propose a second-order optimization method that utilizes a dynamic system model to represent the trajectory of optimization variables as an ODE. We then follow the quasi-steady state trajectory by forcing variables with the fastest rise time into a state known as quiescence. This optimization via quiescence allows us to adaptively select large step-sizes that sequentially follow each optimization variable to a quasi-steady state until all state variables reach the actual steady state, coinciding with the optimum. The result is a second-order method that utilizes large step-sizes and does not require a monotonically decreasing objective function to reach a critical point. Experimentally, we demonstrate the fast convergence of this approach for optimizing nonconvex problems in power systems and compare them to existing state-of-the-art second-order methods, including damped Newton-Raphson, BFGS, and SR1.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the ranges of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between the experimental data and the data from the numerical simulation of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities and material properties of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Load Forecasting of Distribution Power Systems based on Empirical Copulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable electricity load forecasts are becoming increasingly important as the share of intermittent resources in the system increases. Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are called to accurately forecast their production and consumption to place optimal bids in the day-ahead market. Forecasts must account for the volatility of weather-parameters that impacts both the production and consumption of electricity. If DSO-loads are small or lower-granularity forecasts are needed, parametric statistical methods may fail to provide reliable performance since they rely on a priori statistical distributions of the variables to forecast. In this paper, we introduce a Probabilistic Load Forecast (PLF) method based on Empirical Copulas (ECs). The model is datadriven, does not need a priori assumption on parametric distribution for variables, nor the dependence structure (copula). It employs a kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution using beta kernels that have bounded support on the unit hypercube. The method naturally supports variables with widely different distributions, such as weather data (including forecasted ones) and historic electricity consumption, and produces a conditional probability distribution for every time step in the forecast, which allows inferring the quantiles of interest. The proposed non-parametric approach differs significantly from previous forecasting methods based on copulas, which typically uses copulas to model hierarchical dependence. The bandwidth of the beta kernel density estimators is optimized using Integrated Square Error (ISE). We present results from an open dataset and showcase the strength of the model with respect to Quantile Regression (QR) using standard probabilistic evaluation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).</description>

      <title>Balancing Application Relevant and Sparsity Revealing Excitation in Input Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum absolute correlation between regressors, which is called mutual coherence, plays an essential role in sparse estimation. A regressor matrix whose columns are highly correlated may result from optimal input design, since there is no constraint on the mutual coherence, making it difficult to handle sparse estimation. This paper aims to tackle this issue for fixed denominator models, which include Laguerre, Kautz, and generalized orthonormal basis function expansion models, for example.
  The paper proposes an optimal input design method where the achieved Fisher information matrix is fitted to the desired Fisher matrix, together with a coordinate transformation designed to make the regressors in the transformed coordinates have low mutual coherence. The method can be used together with any sparse estimation method and any desired Fisher matrix. A numerical study shows its potential for alleviating the problem of model order selection when used in conjunction with, for example, classical methods such as the Akaike Information Criterion.</description>

      <title>MPC using mixed-integer programming for aquifer thermal energy storages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) are used to temporally store thermal energy in groundwater saturated aquifers. Typically, two storages are combined, one for heat and one for cold, to support heating and cooling of buildings. This way, the use of classical fossil fuel-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning can be significantly reduced. Exploiting the benefits of ATES beyond "seasonal" heating in winter and cooling in summer as well as meeting legislative restrictions requires sophisticated control. We propose a tailored model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the sustainable operation of ATES systems, which mainly builds on a novel model and objective function. The new approach leads to a mixed-integer quadratic program. Its performance is evaluated on real data from an ATES system in Belgium.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description>

      <title>A Family of Switching Pursuit Strategies for a Multi-Pursuer Single-Evader Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of pursuit strategies for multi-pursuer single-evader games in a planar environment. They leverage conditions under which the minimum-time solution of the game becomes equivalent to that of a suitable two-pursuer single-evader game. This enables the design of strategies in which the pursuers first aim to meet such conditions, and then transition to a two-pursuer game once they are satisfied. As a consequence, naive strategies that are in general unsuccessful, can be turned into winning strategies by switching to the appropriate two-pursuer game. Moreover, it is shown via numerical simulations that the switching mechanism significantly enhances the performance of existing pursuit algorithms, like those based on Voronoi partitions.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of Reachable Sets for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed reachable set computation for multi-agent systems (MASs) interacting over an undirected, stationary graph. A full state-feedback control input for such MASs depends no only on the current agent's state, but also of its neighbors. However, in most MAS applications, the dynamics are obscured by individual agents. This makes reachable set computation, in a fully distributed manner, a challenging problem. We utilize the ideas of polytopic reachable set approximation and generalize it to a MAS setup. We formulate the resulting sub-problems in a fully distributed manner and provide convergence guarantees for the associated computations. The proposed algorithm's convergence is proved for two cases: static MAS graphs, and time-varying graphs under certain restrictions.</description>

Abstract: The attitude of a rigid-body in the three dimensional space has a unique and global definition on the Special Orthogonal Group SO (3). This paper gives an overview of the rotation matrix, attitude kinematics and parameterization. The four most frequently used methods of attitude representations are discussed with detailed derivations, namely Euler angles, angle-axis parameterization, Rodriguez vector, and unit-quaternion. The mapping from one representation to others including SO (3) is given. Also, important results which could be useful for the process of filter and/or control design are given. The main weaknesses of attitude parameterization using Euler angles, angle-axis parameterization, Rodriguez vector, and unit-quaternion are illustrated.

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and sometimes even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Clique-Wise Coupled Problems via Three-Operator Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores distributed optimization problems with clique-wise coupling via operator splitting and how we can utilize this framework for performance analysis and enhancement. This framework extends beyond conventional pairwise coupled problems (e.g., consensus optimization) and is applicable to broader examples. To this end, we first introduce a new distributed optimization algorithm by leveraging a clique-based matrix and the Davis-Yin splitting (DYS), a versatile three-operator splitting method. We then demonstrate that this approach sheds new light on conventional algorithms in the following way: (i) Existing algorithms (NIDS, Exact diffusion, diffusion, and our previous work) can be derived from our proposed method; (ii) We present a new mixing matrix based on clique-wise coupling, which surfaces when deriving the NIDS. We prove its preferable distribution of eigenvalues, enabling fast consensus; (iii) These observations yield a new linear convergence rate for the NIDS with non-smooth objective functions. Remarkably our linear rate is first established for the general DYS with a projection for a subspace. This case is not covered by any prior results, to our knowledge. Finally, numerical examples showcase the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Semantic Region Aware Autonomous Exploration for Multi-Type Map Construction in Unknown Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream autonomous exploration methods usually perform excessively-repeated explorations for the same region, leading to long exploration time and exploration trajectory in complex scenes. To handle this issue, we propose a novel semantic region aware autonomous exploration method, the core idea of which is considering the information of semantic regions to optimize the autonomous navigation strategy. Our method enables the mobile robot to fully explore the current semantic region before moving to the next region, contributing to avoid excessively-repeated explorations and accelerate the exploration speed. In addition, compared with existing au?tonomous exploration methods that usually construct the single-type map, our method allows to construct four types of maps including point cloud map, occupancy grid map, topological map, and semantic map. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest 50.7% exploration time reduction and 48.1% exploration trajectory length reduction while maintaining &gt;98% exploration rate when comparing with the classical RRT (Rapid-exploration Random Tree) based autonomous exploration method.</description>

      <title>A Course in Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are derived from a graduate-level course in dynamic optimization, offering an introduction to techniques and models extensively used in management science, economics, operations research, engineering, and computer science. The course emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings of discrete-time dynamic programming models and advanced algorithmic strategies for solving these models. Unlike typical treatments, it provides a proof for the principle of optimality for upper semi-continuous dynamic programming, a middle ground between the simpler countable state space case \cite{bertsekas2012dynamic}, and the involved universally measurable case \cite{bertsekas1996stochastic}. This approach is sufficiently rigorous to include important examples such as dynamic pricing, consumption-savings, and inventory management models. The course also delves into the properties of value and policy functions, leveraging classical results \cite{topkis1998supermodularity} and recent developments. Additionally, it offers an introduction to reinforcement learning, including a formal proof of the convergence of Q-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the notes delve into policy gradient methods for the average reward case, presenting a convergence result for the tabular case in this context. This result is simple and similar to the discounted case but appears to be new.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>LEGO: QEC Decoding System Architecture for Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a critical component of FTQC; the QEC decoder is an important part of Classical Computing for Quantum or C4Q. Recent years have seen fast development in real-time QEC decoders. Existing efforts to build real-time decoders have yet to achieve a critical milestone: decoding dynamic logical circuits with error-corrected readout and feed forward. Achieving this requires significant engineering effort to adapt and reconfigure the decoders during runtime, depending on the branching of the logical circuit.
  We present a QEC decoder architecture called LEGO, with the ambitious goal of supporting dynamic logical operations. LEGO employs a novel abstraction called the decoding block to describe the decoding problem of a dynamic logical circuit. Moreover, decoding blocks can be combined with three other ideas to improve the efficiency, accuracy and latency of the decoder. First, they provide data and task parallelisms when combined with fusion-based decoding. Second, they can exploit the pipeline parallelism inside multi-stage decoders. Finally, they serve as basic units of work for computational resource management.
  Using decoding blocks, LEGO can be easily reconfigured to support all QEC settings and to easily accommodate innovations in three interdependent fields: code, logical operations and qubit hardware. In contrast, existing decoders are highly specialized to a specific QEC setting, which leads to redundant research and engineering efforts, slows down innovation, and further fragments the nascent quantum computing industry.</description>
