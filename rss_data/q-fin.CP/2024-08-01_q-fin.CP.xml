      <title>Enhancing Deep Hedging of Options with Implied Volatility Surface Feedback Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamic hedging scheme for S&amp;P 500 options, where rebalancing decisions are enhanced by integrating information about the implied volatility surface dynamics. The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep policy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm, with a novel hybrid neural network architecture improving the training performance. The favorable inclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface allows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as practitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation and backtesting experiments.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly scalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional approaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or assumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from the need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from market data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&amp;P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the models leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels of transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Is the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging a statistical arbitrage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) claims that under a complete market admitting statistical arbitrage, the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging can be a statistical arbitrage if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from including a speculative overlay within its hedging strategy.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the deep BSDE method for stochastic control problems formulated through the stochastic maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that decision-making problems from stochastic control can be formulated by means of a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). Recently, the authors of Ji et al. 2022 proposed an efficient deep learning algorithm based on the stochastic maximum principle (SMP). In this paper, we provide a convergence result for this deep SMP-BSDE algorithm and compare its performance with other existing methods. In particular, by adopting a strategy as in Han and Long 2020, we derive a-posteriori estimate, and show that the total approximation error can be bounded by the value of the loss functional and the discretization error. We present numerical examples for high-dimensional stochastic control problems, both in case of drift- and diffusion control, which showcase superior performance compared to existing algorithms.</description>
