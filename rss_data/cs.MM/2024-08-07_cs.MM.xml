      <title>ASR-enhanced Multimodal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Product Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text, together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product retrieval.</description>

      <title>Lighthouse: A User-Friendly Library for Reproducible Video Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Lighthouse, a user-friendly library for reproducible video moment retrieval and highlight detection (MR-HD). Although researchers proposed various MR-HD approaches, the research community holds two main issues. The first is a lack of comprehensive and reproducible experiments across various methods, datasets, and video-text features. This is because no unified training and evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly design. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up individual environments. In addition, most works release only the training codes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD. Lighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible codebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In addition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods easily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate that Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference papers. The code is available at https://github.com/line/lighthouse.</description>

      <title>Multitask and Multimodal Neural Tuning for Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large-scale multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, enabling these models to effectively perform multiple multimodal tasks simultaneously remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel tuning method called neural tuning, designed to handle diverse multimodal tasks concurrently, including reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. Neural tuning emulates sparse distributed representation in human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Additionally, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, where each sample is annotated with multiple task labels. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we achieve simultaneous task handling in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be publicly available after publication, facilitating further research and development in this field.</description>

      <title>MaskAnyone Toolkit: Offering Strategies for Minimizing Privacy Risks and Maximizing Utility in Audio-Visual Data Archiving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MaskAnyone, a novel toolkit designed to navigate some privacy and ethical concerns of sharing audio-visual data in research. MaskAnyone offers a scalable, user-friendly solution for de-identifying individuals in video and audio content through face-swapping and voice alteration, supporting multi-person masking and real-time bulk processing. By integrating this tool within research practices, we aim to enhance data reproducibility and utility in social science research. Our approach draws on Design Science Research, proposing that MaskAnyone can facilitate safer data sharing and potentially reduce the storage of fully identifiable data. We discuss the development and capabilities of MaskAnyone, explore its integration into ethical research practices, and consider the broader implications of audio-visual data masking, including issues of consent and the risk of misuse. The paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness and ethical integration of masking tools in such research settings.</description>

      <title>ReSyncer: Rewiring Style-based Generator for Unified Audio-Visually Synced Facial Performer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lip-syncing videos with given audio is the foundation for various applications including the creation of virtual presenters or performers. While recent studies explore high-fidelity lip-sync with different techniques, their task-orientated models either require long-term videos for clip-specific training or retain visible artifacts. In this paper, we propose a unified and effective framework ReSyncer, that synchronizes generalized audio-visual facial information. The key design is revisiting and rewiring the Style-based generator to efficiently adopt 3D facial dynamics predicted by a principled style-injected Transformer. By simply re-configuring the information insertion mechanisms within the noise and style space, our framework fuses motion and appearance with unified training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSyncer not only produces high-fidelity lip-synced videos according to audio, but also supports multiple appealing properties that are suitable for creating virtual presenters and performers, including fast personalized fine-tuning, video-driven lip-syncing, the transfer of speaking styles, and even face swapping.

      <title>Television Discourse Decoded: Comprehensive Multimodal Analytics at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the complex task of analyzing televised debates, with a focus on a prime time news debate show from India. Previous methods, which often relied solely on text, fall short in capturing the multimodal essence of these debates. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive automated toolkit that employs advanced computer vision and speech-to-text techniques for large-scale multimedia analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and speech-to-text methods, we transcribe, diarize, and analyze thousands of YouTube videos of a prime-time television debate show in India. These debates are a central part of Indian media but have been criticized for compromised journalistic integrity and excessive dramatization. Our toolkit provides concrete metrics to assess bias and incivility, capturing a comprehensive multimedia perspective that includes text, audio utterances, and video frames. Our findings reveal significant biases in topic selection and panelist representation, along with alarming levels of incivility. This work offers a scalable, automated approach for future research in multimedia analysis, with profound implications for the quality of public discourse and democratic debate. To catalyze further research in this area, we also release the code, dataset collected and supplemental pdf.</description>

      <title>A Picture Is Worth a Graph: A Blueprint Debate Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate that BDoG is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in ScienceQA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.

      <title>MambaMOS: LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based Moving Object Segmentation (MOS) aims to locate and segment moving objects in point clouds of the current scan using motion information from previous scans. Despite the promising results achieved by previous MOS methods, several key issues, such as the weak coupling of temporal and spatial information, still need further study. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model, termed MambaMOS. Firstly, we develop a novel embedding module, the Time Clue Bootstrapping Embedding (TCBE), to enhance the coupling of temporal and spatial information in point clouds and alleviate the issue of overlooked temporal clues. Secondly, we introduce the Motion-aware State Space Model (MSSM) to endow the model with the capacity to understand the temporal correlations of the same object across different time steps. Specifically, MSSM emphasizes the motion states of the same object at different time steps through two distinct temporal modeling and correlation steps. We utilize an improved state space model to represent these motion differences, significantly modeling the motion states. Finally, extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI-MOS and KITTI-Road benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaMOS achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Terminal-K/MambaMOS.</description>

      <title>SafePaint: Anti-forensic Image Inpainting with Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing image inpainting methods have achieved remarkable accomplishments in generating visually appealing results, often accompanied by a trend toward creating more intricate structural textures. However, while these models excel at creating more realistic image content, they often leave noticeable traces of tampering, posing a significant threat to security. In this work, we take the anti-forensic capabilities into consideration, firstly proposing an end-to-end training framework for anti-forensic image inpainting named SafePaint. Specifically, we innovatively formulated image inpainting as two major tasks: semantically plausible content completion and region-wise optimization. The former is similar to current inpainting methods that aim to restore the missing regions of corrupted images. The latter, through domain adaptation, endeavors to reconcile the discrepancies between the inpainted region and the unaltered area to achieve anti-forensic goals. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we validate the effectiveness of domain adaptation for anti-forensic performance. Furthermore, we meticulously crafted a region-wise separated attention (RWSA) module, which not only aligns with our objective of anti-forensics but also enhances the performance of the model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our approach achieves comparable results to existing image inpainting methods while offering anti-forensic capabilities not available in other methods.</description>

      <title>MMTrail: A Multimodal Trailer Video Dataset with Language and Music Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models. However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information. They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions. Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training. In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</description>
