      <title>Enhanced indexation using both equity assets and index options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider how we can include index options in enhanced indexation. We present the concept of an \enquote{option strategy} which enables us to treat options as an artificial asset. An option strategy for a known set of options is a specified set of rules which detail how these options are to be traded (i.e.~bought, rolled over, sold) depending upon market conditions.
  We consider option strategies in the context of enhanced indexation, but we discuss how they have much wider applicability in terms of portfolio optimisation.
  We use an enhanced indexation approach based on second-order stochastic dominance. We consider index options for the S\&amp;P~500, using a dataset of daily stock prices over the period 2017-2025 that has been manually adjusted to account for survivorship bias. This dataset is made publicly available for use by future researchers.
  Our computational results indicate that introducing option strategies in an enhanced indexation setting offers clear benefits in terms of improved out-of-sample performance. This applies whether we use equities or an exchange-traded fund as part of the enhanced indexation portfolio.</description>

      <title>Gradient-enhanced sparse Hermite polynomial expansions for pricing and hedging high-dimensional American options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and easy-to-implement gradient-enhanced least squares Monte Carlo method for computing price and Greeks (i.e., derivatives of the price function) of high-dimensional American options. It employs the sparse Hermite polynomial expansion as a surrogate model for the continuation value function, and essentially exploits the fast evaluation of gradients. The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted $H^1$ space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural network-based methods up to dimension 100.</description>
