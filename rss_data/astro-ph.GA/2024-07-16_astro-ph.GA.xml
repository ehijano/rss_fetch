      <title>Effects of Subhalos on Interpreting Highly Magnified Sources Near Lensing Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to $N$-body simulations. Then, we compare a semi-analytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method which we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a $z = 6.2$ candidate of magnified single or multiple star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint ($\lesssim 0.3\, \mathrm{pc}$) previously derived from macro lens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to ten when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is $\lesssim 0.5''$, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-$z$ observations.</description>

      <title>A$^3$COSMOS: the dust mass function and dust mass density at $0.5&lt;z&lt;6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Although dust in galaxies represents only a few percent of the total baryonic mass, it plays a crucial role in the physical processes occurring in galaxies. Studying the dust content of galaxies, particularly at high$-z$, is therefore crucial to understand the link between dust production, obscured star formation and the build-up of galaxy stellar mass.
  Aims. To study the dust properties (mass and temperature) of the largest Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)-selected sample of star-forming galaxies available from the archive (A$^3$COSMOS) and derive the dust mass function and dust mass density of galaxies from $z=0.5\,-\,6$.
  Methods. We performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with the CIGALE code to constrain the dust mass and temperature of the A$^3$COSMOS galaxy sample, thanks to the UV-to-near-infrared photometric coverage of each galaxies combined with the ALMA (and Herschel when available) coverage of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of their dust-continuum emission. We then computed and fitted the dust mass function by combining the A$^3$COSMOS and state-of-the-art {\it Herschel} samples, in order to obtain the best estimate of the integrated dust mass density up to $z \sim 6$.
  Results. Galaxies in \a3 have dust masses between $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. From the SED fitting, we were also able to derive a dust temperature, finding that the distribution of the dust temperature peaks at $\sim 30-35$K. The dust mass function at $z=0.5\,-\,6$ evolves with an increase of $M^*$ and decrease of the number density ($\Phi ^*$) and is in good agreement with literature estimates. The dust mass density shows a smooth decrease in its evolution from $z \sim 0.5$ to $z \sim 6$, which is steeper than what is found by models at $z \gtrsim 2$.</description>

      <title>Stripe 82-XL: the $\sim$54.8 deg$^2$ and $\sim$18.8 Ms Chandra and XMM-Newton point source catalog and number of counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an enhanced version of the publicly-available Stripe 82X catalog (S82-XL), featuring a comprehensive set of 22,737 unique X-ray point sources identified with a significance $\gtrsim 4\sigma$. This catalog is four times larger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering $\sim54.8$ deg$^2$ of non-overlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the area and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes) of 3.4$\times 10^{-16}$ (2.4$\times 10^{-15}$), 2.9$\times 10^{-15}$ (1.5$\times 10^{-14}$), and 1.4$\times 10^{-15}$ (9.5$\times 10^{-15}$) erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ across the soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV), and full (0.5-10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area parameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with rest-frame luminosities from $1.2\times 10^{38}$ to $1.6\times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 2-10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, $7.2\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and spectroscopic redshifts up to $z\sim6$. By using hardness ratios, we derived Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) obscuration obtaining a median value of $N_H=21.6_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$, and an overall, obscured fraction ($\log N_H/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}&gt;22$) of $\sim 36.9\%$. S82-XL serves as a benchmark in X-ray surveys and, with its extensive multiwavelength data, is especially valuable for comprehensive studies of luminous AGNs.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Dust temperature and physical conditions of the interstellar medium in a typical galaxy at z=5.66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09681v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new $\lambda_{\rm rest}=77$ $\mu$m dust continuum observations from the ALMA of HZ10 (CRISTAL-22), a dusty main-sequence galaxy at $z$=5.66 as part of the [CII] Resolved Ism in STar-forming Alma Large program, CRISTAL. The high angular resolution of the ALMA Band 7 and new Band 9 data($\sim{0}''.4$) reveals the complex structure of HZ10, which comprises two main components (HZ10-C and HZ10-W) and a bridge-like dusty emission between them (the Bridge). We model the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) to constrain the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) and its variations among the different components identified in HZ10. We find that HZ10-W (the more UV-obscured component) has an SED dust temperature of $T_{\rm SED}$$\sim$51.2$\pm13.1$ K; this is $\sim$5 K higher (although still consistent) than that of the central component and previous global estimations for HZ10. Our new ALMA data allow us to reduce by a factor of $\sim$2.3 the uncertainties of global $T_{\rm SED}$ measurements compared to previous studies. Interestingly, HZ10-W shows a lower [CII]/FIR ratio compared to the other two components (although still within the uncertainties), suggesting a harder radiation field destroying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon associated with [CII] emission (e.g., active galactic nuclei or young stellar populations). While HZ10-C appears to follow the tight IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation seen in local UV-selected starburst galaxies and high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, we find that both HZ10-W and the Bridge depart from this relation and are well described by dust-screen models with holes in front of a hard UV radiation field. This suggests that the UV emission (likely from young stellar populations) is strongly attenuated in the more dusty components of the HZ10 system.</description>

      <title>Formation of S-bearing complex organic molecules in interstellar clouds via ice reactions with C2H2, HS, and atomic H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical network governing interstellar sulfur has been the topic of unrelenting discussion for the past decades due to the conspicuous discrepancy between its expected and observed abundances in different interstellar environments. More recently, the astronomical detections of CH3CH2SH and CH2CS highlighted the importance of interstellar formation routes for sulfur-bearing organic molecules with two carbon atoms. In this work, we perform a laboratory investigation of the solid-state chemistry resulting from the interaction between C2H2 molecules and SH radicals -- both thought to be present in interstellar icy mantles -- at 10 K. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry combined with temperature-programmed desorption experiments are employed as analytical techniques. We confirm that SH radicals can kick-start a sulfur reaction network under interstellar cloud conditions and identify at least six sulfurated products: CH3CH2SH, CH2CHSH, HSCH2CH2SH, H2S2, and tentatively CH3CHS and CH2CS. Complementarily, we utilize computational calculations to pinpoint the reaction routes that play a role in the chemical network behind our experimental results. The main sulfur-bearing organic molecule formed under our experimental conditions is CH3CH2SH and its formation yield increases with the ratios of H to other reactants. It serves as a sink to the sulfur budget within the network, being formed at the expense of the other unsaturated products. The astrophysical implications of the chemical network proposed here are discussed.</description>

      <title>The disc origin of the Milky Way bulge: On the high velocity dispersion of metal-rich stars at low latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the chemo-kinematic properties of stars in the Galactic bulge have revealed a puzzling trend. Along the bulge minor axis, and close to the Galactic plane, metal-rich stars display a higher line-of-sight velocity dispersion compared to metal-poor stars, while at higher latitudes metal-rich stars have lower velocity dispersions than metal-poor stars, similar to what is found in the Galactic disc. In this work, we re-examine this issue, by studying the dependence of line-of-sight velocity dispersions on metallicity and latitude in the latest APOGEE Data Release 17, confirming the results of previous works. We then analyse an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, also taking into account observational biases introduced by the APOGEE selection function. We show that the inversion in the line-of-sight velocity dispersion-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge can be reproduced by our model. We show that this inversion is a natural consequence of a scenario in which the bulge is a boxy/peanut-shaped structure, whose metal-rich and metal-poor stars mainly originate from the thin and thick disc of the Milky Way, respectively. Due to their cold kinematics, metal-rich, thin disc stars, are efficiently trapped in the boxy/peanut bulge, and, at low latitudes, show a strong barred morphology, which results in high velocity dispersions which are larger than those attained by the metal-poor populations. Extremely metal-rich stars in the Galactic bulge, which have received renewed attention in the literature, do follow the same trends as those of the metal-rich populations. The line-of-sight velocity-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge for metal-poor and metal-rich stars are thus both an effect of the intrinsic nature of the Galactic bulge and of the angle at which we observe it from the Sun.</description>

      <title>Molecular clouds: do they deserve a non-Gaussian description?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds show complex structures reflecting their non-linear dynamics. Many studies, investigating the bridge between their morphology and physical properties, have shown the interest provided by non-Gaussian higher-order statistics to grasp physical information. Yet, as this bridge is usually characterized in the supervised world of simulations, transferring it onto observations can be hazardous, especially when the discrepancy between simulations and observations remains unknown. In this paper, we aim at identifying relevant summary statistics directly from the observation data. To do so, we develop a test that compares the informative power of two sets of summary statistics for a given dataset. Contrary to supervised approaches, this test does not require the knowledge of any data label or parameter, but focuses instead on comparing the degeneracy levels of these descriptors, relying on a notion of statistical compatibility. We apply this test to column density maps of 14 nearby molecular clouds observed by Herschel, and iteratively compare different sets of usual summary statistics. We show that a standard Gaussian description of these clouds is highly degenerate but can be substantially improved when being estimated on the logarithm of the maps. This illustrates that low-order statistics, properly used, remain a very powerful tool. We then further show that such descriptions still exhibit a small quantity of degeneracies, some of which are lifted by the higher order statistics provided by reduced wavelet scattering transforms. This property of observations quantitatively differs from state-of-the-art simulations of dense molecular cloud collapse and is not reproduced by logfBm models. Finally we show how the summary statistics identified can be cooperatively used to build a morphological distance, which is evaluated visually, and gives very satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>The formation of supermassive black holes from Population III.1 seeds. III. Galaxy evolution and black hole growth from semi-analytic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of Pop III.1 seeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution to assess the growth the SMBH population and the properties of the host galaxies. The model of Pop III.1 seeding involves SMBH formation at redshifts $z\gtrsim 20$ in dark matter minihalos that are isolated from external radiative feedback, parameterized by isolation distance $d_{\rm iso}$. Within a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we generate dark matter halos using the code \textsc{pinocchio} and seed them according to the Pop III.1 scenario, exploring values of $d_{\rm iso}$ from 50 to 100~kpc (proper distance). We consider two alternative cases of SMBH seeding: a Halo Mass Threshold (HMT) model in which all halos $&gt;7\times10^{10}\:M_\odot$ are seeded with $\sim 10^5\:M_\odot$ black holes; an All Light Seed (ALS) model in which all halos are seeded with low, stellar-mass black holes. We follow the redshift evolution of the halos, populating them with galaxies using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly theoretical model of galaxy formation, including accretion on SMBHs and related feedback processes. Here we present predictions for the properties of galaxy populations, focusing on stellar masses, star formation rates, and black hole masses. The local, $z\sim0$ metrics of occupation fraction as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), and black hole mass function (BHMF) all suggest a constraint of $d_{\rm iso}&lt;75\:$kpc. We discuss the implications of this result for the Pop III.1 seeding mechanism.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Understanding the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We model the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes are studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parametrization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximal angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs of grain aggregates, and to resolve this problem we propose a new parametrization which predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are strongest for larger grains with smaller monomer-density, this manifests as size and monomer-density dependence in the constant part of the parametrization. Following the constant part, the parametrization has two power-laws with different slopes, which retain the universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength, due to different drag mechanisms dominating depending on grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Modelling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-Mass YSOs: I: Constraining the Role of Iron Inclusions and Inelastic Relaxation on Grain Alignment with ALMA Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron inclusions embedded inside dust grains play a crucial role in both internal alignment via Barnett relaxation and external alignment via the MAgnetically Enhanced RAdiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism. Moreover, inelastic relaxation is predicted to dominate over Barnett relaxation in driving the internal alignment of micron-sized and very large grains above $10\mu m$ (VLGs). Yet, a detailed modeling of polarized thermal dust emission from Class 0/I Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) taking into account these effects and their observational constraints are still lacking. In this paper, we perform synthetic dust polarization modeling for MHD simulations of an intermediate-mass YSOs using our updated POLARIS code developed by Giang et al. (2022). Synthetic polarization results are then post-processed with CASA to confront ALMA observations. We found that to reproduce the high polarization degree of $p \sim 5-30\%$ observed in protostellar envelopes by ALMA, micron-sized and VLGs must contain iron inclusions with $N_{\rm cl} \sim 5 - 10^{4}$ iron atoms per cluster, assuming $30\%$ of iron abundance locked inside dust grains under the cluster form. Inside the inner $\sim 500$ au region, it requires inelastic relaxation, larger iron inclusions of $N_{\rm cl} \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$, and grain growth beyond $\geq 10\mu m$ to reproduce $\sim 3-10\%$ of polarization observed by ALMA. But given such a combination, the internal alignment and MRAT efficiency acting on VLGs still decrease toward the center, which produces the decrease of $p(\%)$ with increasing gas density, reaching $p \sim 1\%$ inside the disk. Additionally, our results show that the high polarization by ALMA toward YSOs is not totally an artifact caused by the interferometric filtering, but it could be explained by the efficient magnetic alignment of SPM grains by MRAT mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring fluorine chemical evolution in the Galactic disk: the open cluster perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters are ideal tools for tracing the abundances of different elements because their stars are expected to have the same age, distance, and metallicity. Therefore, they serve as very powerful tracers for investigating the cosmic origins of elements. This paper expands on a recent study by us, where the element Fluorine was studied in seven previously open clusters, adding six open clusters as well as eight field stars. The primary objective is to determine the abundance of fluorine (F) to gain insight into its production and evolution. The magnesium (Mg) abundances were derived to categorize the field stars into high and low alpha disk populations. Additionally, cerium (Ce) abundances are determined to better understand the interplay between F and s-process elements. The spectra were obtained from the high-resolution near-infra-red GIANO-B instrument at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). For the derivation of the stellar parameters and abundances, the Python version of Spectroscopy Made Easy (PySME) was used. OH, CN, and CO molecular lines and band heads along with Fe I lines were used to determine the stellar parameters in the H-band region. Two HF lines in the K-band ({\lambda}{\lambda} 2.28, 2.33 {\mu}m), three K-band Mg I lines ({\lambda}{\lambda} 2.10, 2.11, 2.15 {\mu}m), and two Ce II lines in the H-band ({\lambda}{\lambda} 1.66, and 1.71 {\mu}m) were used to derive the abundances of F, Mg, and Ce, respectively. F, Mg, and Ce abundances were derived for 14 stars from 6 OCs, as well as 8 field stars. The F and Ce abundances were investigated as a function of metallicity, age, and Galactocentric distances. Our results indicate that asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars, including a subset of fast rotators (whose rotation speed likely increases as metallicity decreases), are necessary to explain the cosmic origin of F.</description>

Abstract: We involve the galactic halo observational data to test the weak field General Relativity involving the cosmological constant. Using the data for 15 hydrogen (Hi) VLA super spirals and the Tully-Fisher relation we obtain constraints for each galaxy. The results are consistent with previous results for spiral galaxies, as well as with the scaling relations for the halos, thus confirming the efficiency of the use of dark halo data and Tully-Fisher relation, including the baryonic Tully{Fisher index (BTFR), for testing modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at $\lambda&gt;4000$ A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at $\lambda&lt;3000$ A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ($\gamma&lt;1$; $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$) with a characteristic gas density of $\simeq 10-10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.</description>

      <title>CircleZ: Reliable Photometric redshifts for AGN computed using only photometry from Legacy Survey Imaging for DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged)Photometric redshifts for AGN (galaxies hosting an accreting supermassive black hole in their center) are notoriously challenging and currently better computed via SED fitting, assuming that deep photometry for many wavelengths is available. However, for AGN detected all-sky, the photometry is limited and provided by different projects. This makes the task of homogenising the data challenging and is a dramatic drawback for the millions of AGN that wide surveys like SRG/eROSITA will detect. This work aims to compute reliable photometric redshifts for X-ray-detected AGN using only one dataset that covers a large area: the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey (LS10) for DESI. LS10 provides deep grizW1-W4 forced photometry within various apertures, thus avoids issues related to the cross-calibration of surveys. We present the results from CircleZ, a machine-learning algorithm based on a Fully Connected Neural Network. CircleZ uses training sample of 14,000 X-ray-detected AGN and utilizes multi-aperture photometry. The accuracy and the fraction of outliers reached in a test sample of 2913 AGN are 0.067 and 11.6%, respectively. The results are comparable to or better than those obtained previously for the same field but with much less effort. We further tested the stability of the results by computing the photometric redshifts for the sources detected in CSC2 and Chandra-COSMOS Legacy, reaching comparable accuracy as in eFEDS when limiting the magnitude of the counterparts with respect to the depth of LS10. The method applies to fainter samples of AGN using deeper optical data from future surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid), granted LS10-like information on the light distribution beyond a morphological type is provided. With the paper, we release an updated version of the photometric redshifts (including errors and probability distribution function) for eROSITA/eFEDS.</description>

      <title>Correlations between IR Luminosity, Star Formation Rate, and CO Luminosity in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the DustPedia sample of galaxies within approximately 40 Mpc, selecting 388 sources, to investigate the correlations between IR luminosity (L$_{\rm IR}$), the star formation rate (SFR), and the CO(1-0) luminosity (L$_{\rm CO}$) down to much lower luminosities than reached by previous analyses. We find a sub-linear dependence of the SFR on L$_{\rm IR}$. Below $\log(\hbox{L}_{\rm IR}/\hbox{L}_\odot)\simeq 10$ or $\hbox{SFR}\simeq 1\,\hbox{M}_\odot\,\hbox{yr}^{-1}$, the SFR/L$_{\rm IR}$ ratio substantially exceeds the standard ratio for dust-enshrouded star formation, and the difference increases with decreasing L$_{\rm IR}$ values. This implies that the effect of unobscured star formation overcomes that of dust heating by old stars, at variance with results based on the $\textit{Planck}$ ERCSC galaxy sample. We also find that the relations between the L$_{\rm CO}$ and L$_{\rm IR}$ or the SFR are consistent with those obtained at much higher luminosities.</description>

      <title>VVVX survey dusts off a new intermediate-age star cluster in the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our primary long-term objective is to seek out additional star clusters in the poorly studied regions of the MW. The aim of this pursuit is to finalize the MG's globular and open cluster system census and to gain a comprehensive understanding of both the formation and evolution of these systems and our Galaxy as a whole. We report the discovery of a new star cluster, named Garro~03. We investigated this target using a combination of near-infrared and optical databases. We employed VVVX and 2MASS data in the NIR, and Gaia DR3 and the DECaPS2 datasets in the optical passband. We performed a photometrical analysis in order to derive its main physical parameters. Garro~03 is located at equatorial coordinates RA=14:01:29.3 and Dec=-65:30:57.0. It is not heavily affected by extinction $A_{Ks}=0.25\pm 0.04$ mag. It is located at heliocentric distance of $14.1\pm0.5$ kpc, which places Garro~03 at 10.6 kpc from the Galactic centre and Z=-0.89 kpc below the Galactic plane. We calculated the mean cluster PM of ($\mu_{\alpha}^{\ast},\mu_{\delta}) = (-4.57\pm 0.29,\ -1.36\pm 0.27$) mas yr$^{-1}$. We derived an age=3 Gyr and [Fe/H]~$= -0.5\pm 0.2$ by the isochrone-fitting method. The total luminosity was derived in the $K_s$ and V-bands, finding $M_{Ks} = -6.32\pm 1.10$ mag and $M_V =-4.06$ mag. The core and tidal radii were measured constructing the Garro~03 radial density profile and fitting the King model, obtaining $r_c = 3.07\pm 0.98$ pc and $r_t = 19.36\pm 15.96$ pc. We photometrically confirm the cluster nature for Garro~03, located in the Galactic disk. It is a distant, low-luminosity, metal-rich star cluster of intermediate age. We also searched for possible signatures (streams or bridges) between Garro~03 and Garro~01, but we exclude a possible companionship. We need spectroscopic data to classify it as an old open cluster or a young globular cluster, and to understand its origin.</description>

      <title>LeMMINGs. Multi-wavelength constraints on the co-existence of nuclear star clusters and AGN in nucleated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] The relation between nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and the growth of the central SMBHs, as well as their connection to the properties of the host galaxies, is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Recent observations have revealed that about 10 per cent of nucleated galaxies host hybrid nuclei, consisting of both NSCs and accreting SMBHs that power active galactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the potential of the recently published multi-wavelength data sets from LeMMINGs survey, here we present the most thorough investigation to date of the incidence of hybrid nuclei in a large sample of 100 nearby nucleated galaxies (10 E, 25 S0, 63 S, and 2 Irr), covering a wide range in stellar mass ($M_{*,\rm gal} \sim 10^{8.7}-10^{12}~\rm M_{sun}$). We identify the nuclei and derive their properties by performing detailed 1D and 2D multi-component decompositions of the optical and near-infrared $HST$ stellar light distributions of the galaxies using S\'ersic and core-S\'ersic models. Our AGN diagnostics are based on homogeneously derived nuclear 1.5 GHz $e$-MERLIN radio, $Chandra$ X-ray (0.3--10 keV) and optical emission-line data. We determine the nucleation fraction ($f_{\rm nuc} $) as the relative incidence of nuclei across the LeMMINGs $HST$ sample and find $f_{\rm nuc} =~ $100/149 (= 67 $\pm$ 7 per cent), confirming previous work, with a peak value of 49/56~(= $88 \pm 13$ per cent) at bulge masses $M_{*,\rm bulge} \sim 10^{9.4}$- $10^{10.8}~\rm M_{sun}$. We identify 30 nucleated LeMMINGs galaxies that are optically active, radio-detected and X-ray luminous ($L_{X} &gt; 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$). This indicates that our nucleated sample has a lower limit $\sim$ 30 per cent occupancy of hybrid nuclei, which is a function of $M_{*,\rm bulge}$ and $M_{*,\rm gal}$. We find that hybrid nuclei have a number density of $(1.5 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Revealing Gas Inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gas inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) based on the gas morphological and kinematic features from the MWISP in the region of l=1.2 deg--19.0 deg and |b|&lt;3.0 deg. We find that the near dust lane extends to l~15 deg, in which the end of the large-scale gas structure intersects with the 3 kpc-ring at a distance of ~5 kpc. Intriguingly, many filamentary MCs, together with the bow-like/ballistic-like clouds and continuous CO features with notable velocity gradient, are finely outlined along the long structure. These MCs also have relatively large velocity dispersions, indicating the shocked gas generated by local continuous accretion and thus the enhanced turbulence along the entire gas structure. We suggest that the ~3.1--3.6 kpc long CO structure originates from the accretion molecular gas driven by the Galactic bar. The gas near the bar end at the 3 kpc-ring becomes an important reservoir for the large-scale accreting flows inwards to the CMZ through the bar channel. The inclination angle of the bar is estimated to be 20--26 deg, while the pattern speed of the bar is 30--35 km/s. The total mass of the whole gas lane is about (0.9-1.7)x10^7 Msun according to the calculated X_CO=(0.6-1.4)x10^20 cm^-2 (Kkm/s)^-1 from the large-scale CO data and the complementary HI data. The mean gas inflow rate is about 0.8-1.4 Msun/yr, which seems to be comparable to the outflow's rate of the Galactic nuclear winds after applying the updated lower X-factor value above.</description>

      <title>Accelerated by Dark Matter: a High-redshift Pathway to Efficient Galaxy-scale Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations $g$, or equivalently surface densities $\Sigma = g/(\pi\,G)$, where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as $(1+z)^2$ at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as $(1+z)^{-6}$ and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of $n(&gt;\!M_{\rm vir}) \approx 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \gtrsim 8$. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of $M_{\star} \sim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ can form in regions that end up with sizes $\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm pc})$ over $40\,{\rm Myr}$ time-scales at $z\approx 12-14$; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Counting the Unseen I: Nuclear Density Scaling Relations for Nucleated Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volumetric rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) encodes information on the still-unknown demographics of central massive black holes (MBHs) in low-mass galaxies ($\lesssim 10^9$~M$_\odot$). Theoretical TDE rates from model galaxy samples can extract this information, but this requires accurately defining the nuclear stellar density structures. This region is typically dominated by nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which have been shown to increase TDE rates by orders of magnitude. Thus, we assemble the largest available sample of pc-scale 3-D density profiles that include NSC components. We deproject the PSF-deconvolved surface brightness profiles of 91 nearby galaxies of varying morphology and combine these with nuclear mass-to-light ratios estimated from measured colors or spectral synthesis to create 3-D mass density profiles. We fit the inner 3-D density profile to find the best-fit power-law density profile in each galaxy. We compile this information as a function of galaxy stellar mass to fit new empirical density scaling relations. These fits reveal positive correlations between galaxy stellar mass and central stellar density in both early- and late-type galaxies. We find that early-type galaxies have somewhat higher densities and shallower profiles relative to late-type galaxies at the same mass. We also use the density profiles to estimate the influence radius of each galaxy's MBH and find that the sphere of influence was likely resolved in most cases. These new relations will be used in future works to build mock galaxy samples for dynamical TDE rate calculations, with the aim of constraining MBH demographics in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jets of radio AGN provide one of the most important forms of AGN feedback, yet considerable uncertainties remain about how they are triggered. Since the molecular gas reservoirs of the host galaxies can supply key information about the dominant triggering mechanism(s), here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) CO(1-0) observations of a complete sample of 29 powerful radio AGN ($P_{1.4GHz} &gt; 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$) with an angular resolution of about 2 - 3 arcsec (corresponding to 2 - 8 kpc). We detect molecular gas with masses in the range $10^{8.9} &lt; M_{H_2} &lt; 10^{10.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ in the early-type host galaxies of 10 targets, while for the other 19 sources we derive upper limits. The detection rate of objects with such large molecular masses -- $34\pm9$% -- is higher than in the general population of non-active early-type galaxies (ETG: $&lt;$10%). The kinematics of the molecular gas are dominated in most cases by rotating disk-like structures, with diameters up to 25 kpc. Compared with the results for samples of quiescent ETG in the literature, we find a larger fraction of more massive, more extended and less settled molecular gas structures. In most of the CO-detected sources, the results are consistent with triggering of the AGN as the gas settles following a merger or close encounter with a gas-rich companion. However, in a minority of objects at the centres of rich clusters of galaxies, the accretion of gas cooling from the hot X-ray halos is a plausible alternative to galaxy interactions as a triggering mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Age and metal gradients in massive quiescent galaxies at $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.0$: implications for quenching and assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved, SSP-equivalent ages, stellar metallicities, and abundance ratios for 456 massive ($10.3\lesssim\log(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)\lesssim11.8$) quiescent galaxies at $0.6\lesssim z\lesssim1.0$ from the LEGA-C survey, derived using full-spectrum models. Typically, we find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients, and negative [Fe/H] gradients, implying iron-rich cores. We also estimate intrinsic [Fe/H] gradients via forward-modeling. We examine the observed gradients in three age bins. Younger quiescent galaxies typically have negative [Fe/H] gradients and positive age gradients, possibly indicating a recent central starburst. Additionally, this finding suggests that photometrically-measured flat colour gradients in young quiescent galaxies are the result of the positive age and negative metallicity gradients cancelling each other. For older quiescent galaxies, the age gradients become flat and [Fe/H] gradients weaken, though remain negative. Thus, negative colour gradients at older ages are likely driven by metallicity gradients. The diminishing age gradient may result from the starburst fading. Furthermore, the persistence of the [Fe/H] gradients may suggest that the outskirts are simultaneously built up by mergers with lower-metallicity satellites. On the other hand, the gradients could be inherited from the star-forming phase, in which case mergers may not be needed to explain our findings. This work illustrates the need for resolved spectroscopy, instead of just photometry, to measure stellar population gradients. Extending these measurements to higher redshift is imperative for understanding how stellar populations in quiescent galaxies are assembled over cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: In this note, an interesting region about the Sun in phase space is described where the permanent capture of an object, $P$, of small mass from interstellar space can occur, under the gravitational perturbation of the resultant mass of the Galaxy. $P$ is never ejected back into interstellar space and won't collide with the Sun. It cycles about the Sun for all time, asymptotically approaching the capture set. In addition to being permanently captured, $P$ is also weakly captured. A recent result in \cite{Belbruno:2024} describes this region in general. It has a fractal structure. This is applied to the permanent capture of rogue planets and other objects from interstellar space</description>

      <title>Optical and UV Flares from Binary Black Hole Mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass, binary black hole (BBH) mergers dominates the sources of gravitational wave (GW) events so far detected the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) experiment. The origin of these BBHs is unknown, and no electromagnetic (EM) counterpart has been undoubtedly associated to any of such GW events. The thin discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) might be viable environments where BBHs can form and at the same time produce observable radiation feedback. This paper presents new physically motivated light-curve (LC) solutions for thermal flares driven by the remnant of a BBH merger within the disc of an AGN. Following previous analyses, we consider that the BBH likely creates an under-density cavity in the disc prior to its coalescence. Depending on the merger conditions, the black hole (BH) remnant can leave the cavity, interact with the unperturbed disc, and drive a transient BH wind. The wind expels disc material that expands above and below the disc plane and we consider the emission of these plasma ejections as the EM counterpart to the merger GW. We model the LC of such eruptions as mini supernovae explosions finding that stellar mass merger remnants can drive distinguishable flares in optical and UV bands, with time lags of $\sim 10-40$ ($100-400$) days after the GW event, lasting for a few days (weeks) when occurring in AGN with central engines of $\sim 10^6$ ($10^7$) M$_\odot$. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory can potentially detect the optical component of these EM counterparts up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.5 - 1$, accordingly. The present LC models are applicable to localise flaring AGNs as sources of multi-messenger emission following GW alerts.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the birthplaces of NGC2070's massive stars, tracked with MUSE and revealed with JWST</title>

Abstract: The formation of massive O-type stars cannot be simply explained as a scaled-up version of the accretion mechanisms observed in lower-mass stars. Understanding these processes necessitates systematic studies of their early stages. Forming massive stars remain embedded in their dense nursery clouds, and IR instruments with high spatial resolution capabilities are needed to better observe them. Despite these challenges, MUSE optical observations of the massive cluster NGC 2070 successfully detected potential star-forming regions through spatially resolved electron density maps. To further explore these regions, the JWST utilized its NIRCam and MIRI instruments to penetrate optically obscured areas. This study examines two specific regions in the southeast part of the NGC 2070 MUSE density map, where tracks of highly dense point sources were identified. NIRCam, partially overlapped with MIRI, resolved these MUSE findings, revealing a procession of stellar point sources in the projected images. The detections are associated with elongated clouds, suggesting greater proper motions compared to the surrounding interstellar medium. These findings may indicate the presence of runaway candidates in the early stages of their evolution that are following common escape routes. This would support the notion that dynamical ejection is an efficient mechanism for the formation of massive runaway stars during early stages and likely plays a significant role in the origin of O-type field stars. However, additional data are required to confirm this scenario and rule out other ionizing feedback mechanisms, such as those observed in the formation of pillar-like structures around HII regions in the Milky Way. MUSE electron density mapping effectively captures the complexity of NGC 2070's interstellar medium and highlights targets for subsequent spectroscopic follow-ups.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>

Abstract: We carried out long-term monitoring of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA binary black hole (BBH) merger candidate S230922g in search of electromagnetic emission from the interaction of the merger remnant with an embedding active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. Using a dataset primarily composed of wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and supplemented by additional photometric and spectroscopic resources, we searched ~ 70% of the sky area probability for transient phenomena, and discovered 6 counterpart candidates. One especially promising candidate - AT 2023aagj - exhibited temporally varying asymmetric components in spectral broad line regions, a feature potentially indicative of an off-center event such as a BBH merger. This represents the first live search and multiwavelength, photometric, and spectroscopic monitoring of a GW BBH optical counterpart candidate in the disk of an AGN.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does molecular complexity emerge and evolve during the process leading to the formation of a planetary system? Astrochemistry is experiencing a golden age, marked by significant advancements in the observation and understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the inner regions of protostellar systems. However, many questions remain open, such as the origin of the chemical diversity observed in the early evolutionary stages, which may influence the chemical composition of the forming planets. Additionally, astrochemistry provides us with powerful tools to investigate the accretion/ejection processes occurring in the inner regions of young embedded objects, such as jets, winds, accretion streamers, and shocks. In this chapter, we review the observational efforts carried out in recent years to chemically characterize the inner regions of Solar-System analogs. We summarize our current understanding of molecular complexity in planet-forming disks and shed light on the existing limitations and unanswered questions. Finally, we highlight the important role of future radio facilities, like SKAO and ngVLA, in exploring the chemical complexity of the regions where planetary systems are emerging.</description>

      <title>Median Surface Brightness Profiles of Lyman-$\alpha$ Haloes in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the median surface brightness profiles of diffuse Ly$\alpha$ haloes (LAHs) around star-forming galaxies by stacking 155 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at 3&lt;z&lt;4 in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field (MXDF), with median Ly$\alpha$ luminosity $\mathrm{L_{Ly\alpha} \approx 10^{41.1} erg\,s^{-1}}$. After correcting for a systematic surface brightness offset we identified in the datacube, we detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission out to a distance of 270 kpc. The median Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profile shows a power-law decrease in the inner 20 kpc, and a possible flattening trend at larger distance. This shape is similar for LAEs with different Ly$\alpha$ luminosities, but the normalisation of the surface brightness profile increases with luminosity. At distances over 50 kpc, we observe strong overlap of adjacent LAHs, and the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness is dominated by the LAHs of nearby LAEs. We find no clear evidence of redshift evolution of the observed Ly$\alpha$ profiles when comparing with samples at 4&lt;z&lt;5 and 5&lt;z&lt;6. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which the inner 20 kpc of the LAH is powered by star formation in the central galaxy, while the LAH beyond a radius of 50 kpc is dominated by photons from surrounding galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved Spectroscopic Analysis of Ly$\alpha$ Haloes: Radial Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Line Profile out to 60 kpc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Ly$\alpha$ haloes (LAHs) have been found to be prevalent around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. However, the origin of the LAHs is still a subject of debate. Spatially resolved analysis of Ly$\alpha$ profiles provides an important diagnostic. We analyse the average spatial extent and spectral variation of the circumgalactic LAHs by stacking a sample of 155 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshift $3&lt;z&lt;4$ in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to the Ly$\alpha$ line of the target LAE, the peak of the Ly$\alpha$ line at large distances becomes increasingly more blueshifted up to a projected distance of 60 kpc ($\approx 3 \times$ virial radius), with a velocity offset of $\approx$ 250 km/s. This trend is evident in both the mean and median stacks, suggesting that it is a general property of our LAE sample, which typically has a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity $\mathrm{\approx 10^{41.1} erg\,s^{-1}}$. However, due to the absence of systemic redshift data, it remains unclear whether the Ly$\alpha$ line peak at large projected distances is less redshifted compared to the inner regions or truly blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity. We explore various scenarios to explain the large-scale kinematics of the Ly$\alpha$ line.</description>

      <title>Why does the Milky Way have a bar?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no doubt that the Milky Way is a barred galaxy; however, factors that establish its prominent morphology remain largely elusive and poorly comprehended. In this work, we attempt to constrain the history of the MW by tracing the present-day parameters and evolution of a set of MW and M31 analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulations. We find that the strength of bars at $z=0$ correlates well not only with the total mass build-up of galaxies but, more crucially, with the time of rapid onset of stellar discs. Discs of strongly barred galaxies form early ($ z \gtrsim 2-3$), compared to weakly barred and non-barred galaxies ($z \approx 1-1.5$). Although we are cautious to draw ultimate conclusions about the governing factor of discs formation due to the complexity and correlations between different physical phenomena~(dark matter mass growth, gas accretion rate, mergers and others) affecting galaxy growth, the observed morphological diversity of galaxies can be tentatively explained by a substantial variation in the gas angular momentum around proto-galaxies already at $z\approx 3-5$; in such a way, early discs with the strongest bars at $z=0$ formed from gas with the largest angular momentum.
  By comparing the formation time scales of discs of barred galaxies in the TNG50 sample, we suggest that the MW has a strong bar ($0.35&lt;A_2&lt;0.6$) and that its stellar disc started to dominate over the spheroidal component already at $z \approx 2$, with a mass of $\approx 1 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. We, therefore, conclude that the presence of a strong bar in the MW is a natural manifestation of the early formation of the stellar disc, which made possible bursty but highly efficient star formation at high redshift.</description>

      <title>The HI covering fraction of Lyman Limit Systems in FIRE haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen (HI) serves a crucial role in connecting galactic-scale properties such as star formation with the large-scale structure of the Universe. While recent numerical simulations have successfully matched the observed covering fraction of HI near Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and in the foreground of luminous quasars at redshifts $z \lesssim 3$, the low-mass end remains as-of-yet unexplored in observational and computational surveys. We employ a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation (FIREbox) supplemented with zoom-in simulations (MassiveFIRE) from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to investigate the HI covering fraction of Lyman Limit Systems ($N_{\mathrm{HI}} \gtrsim 10^{17.2}$ cm$^{-2}$) across a wide range of redshifts ($z=0-6$) and halo masses ($10^8-10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, $10^8-10^{11} M_{\odot}$ at $z=6$) in the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei. We find that the covering fraction inside haloes exhibits a strong increase with redshift, with only a weak dependence on halo mass for higher-mass haloes. For massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{vir}} \sim 10^{11}-10^{12} M_{\odot}$), the radial profiles showcase scale-invariance and remain independent of mass. The radial dependence is well-captured by a fitting function. The covering fractions in our simulations are in good agreement with measurements of the covering fraction in LBGs. Our comprehensive analysis unveils a complex dependence with redshift and halo mass for haloes with $M_{\mathrm{vir}} \lesssim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ that future observations aim to constrain, providing key insights into the physics of structure formation and gas assembly.</description>

      <title>Modelling LAEs in the Epoch of Reionization with OBELISK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lya emitters (LAEs) are particularly useful objects for the study of the Epoch of Reionization. Lya profiles can be used to estimate the amount of ionizing photons that are able to escape the galaxies, and therefore to understand what objects contributed to reionization. However, Lya is a resonant line and its complex radiative transfer effects make the interpretation of the line challenging and require the use of appropriate radiative transfer methods for anything but the simplest gas distributions. With this work we aim to study the properties of simulated LAEs, and the robustness of these inferred properties under a change in the dust model. We also explore the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape fraction of these galaxies and compare our results with observationally calibrated methods to infer this quantity from the Lya spectrum. We use the radiative transfer code RASCAS to perform synthetic observations of 13 flux-selected galaxies from the Obelisk simulation at redshift z = 6, towards the end of the Epoch of Reionization. Each galaxy was observed in Lya, ionizing and non-ionizing continuum from 48 different viewing angles. We show that the Lya profiles emitted from a galaxy present large variations with a change in viewing angle and that the relation between peak separation and Lya escape fraction is not as strong as previously found, as we find lines of sight with both low peak separation and low escape fraction, due to their dust content. We also show that the properties of the Lya line are reasonably robust under a change in dust model. Lastly, we compare the LyC escape fractions we derive from the simulation to three observationally calibrated methods of inferring this quantity. We determine that none of these relations reproduce the scatter that we find in our sample, and that high escape fraction lines of sight have both low peak separation and low dust extinction in the UV.</description>

      <title>Entrainment of Hot Gas into Cold Streams: The Origin of Excessive Star-formation Rates at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of cold streams from the cosmic web that feed galaxies through their shock-heated circumgalactic medium (CGM) at cosmic noon, $z\simeq 1-5$. In addition to the hydrodynamical instabilities and radiative cooling that we have incorporated in earlier works, we embed the stream and the hot CGM in the gravitational potential of the host dark-matter halo, deriving equilibrium profiles for both. Self-gravity within the stream is tentatively ignored. We find that the cold streams gradually entrain a large mass of initially hot CGM gas that cools in the mixing layer and condenses onto the stream. This entrainment, combined with the acceleration down the gravitational potential well, typically triples the inward cold inflow rate into the central galaxy, compared to the original rate at the virial radius, which makes the entrained gas the dominant source of gas supply to the galaxy. The potential sources for the hot gas to be entrained are recycled enriched gas that has been previously ejected from the galaxy, and fresh virial-shock-heated gas that has accumulated in the CGM. This can naturally elevate the star formation rate in the galaxy by a factor of $\sim 3$ compared to the gas accretion rate onto the halo, thus explaining the otherwise puzzling observed excess of star formation at cosmic noon. When accounting for self-shielding of dense gas from the UV background, we find that the energy radiated from the streams, originating predominantly from the cooling of the entrained gas, is consistent with observed Lyman-$\alpha$ blobs around galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful tool to probe the gas content at high redshift is the [C II] 158 $\mu$m sub-millimeter emission line, which, due to its low excitation potential and luminous emission, is considered a possible direct tracer of star forming gas. In this work we investigate the origin, evolution and environmental dependencies of [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission line, as well as its expected correlation with stellar mass and star formation activity of the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST. We use a set of state-of-the-art cold-gas hydrodynamic simulations (ColdSIM) with fully coupled time-dependent atomic and molecular non-equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent [C II] emission from metal enriched gas. We accurately track the evolution of H I, H II and $H_2$ in a cosmological context and predict both global and galaxy-based [C II] properties. For the first time, we predict the cosmic mass density evolution of [C II] and find that it is in good agreement with new measurements at redshift z = 6 from high-resolution optical quasar spectroscopy. We find a correlation between [C II] luminosity, $L_{[C II]}$, and stellar mass, consistent with results from ALMA high-redshift large programs. We predict a redshift evolution in the relation between $L_{[C II]}$ and the star formation rate, SFR, and provide a fit to relate $L_{[C II]}$ to SFR which can be adopted as a more accurate alternative to the currently used linear relation. Our findings provide physical grounds to interpret high-redshift detections in contemporary and future observations, such as the ones performed by ALMA and JWST, and to advance our knowledge on structure formation at early times.</description>

Based on Gaia DR3 data, we apply the hierarchical clustering algorithm to a young open cluster NGC 6530 and group its members into 5 substructures. By linear tracing with the kinematic information of their members, we find that: Sub 1 is the core of the cluster. It is expanding slowly. Sub 2 consists of less bound members, which began escaping from the core about 0.78 Myr ago. Sub 3 is associated with a young star forming region. It will merge with the core after 0.72 Myr; Sub 4, as an outskirt group, is also moving towards the core, but won't end up falling in. While Sub 5 is composed of less-bound members with field contamination. This work reveals the complex internal structure and evolutionary trends of the cluster NGC 6530. It also shows the potential of the hierarchical clustering algorithm in star cluster structure analysis.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations and redshift dependence of the correlation between infrared and radio luminosity</title>

Abstract: We argue that the difference in infrared-to-radio luminosity ratio between local and high-redshift star-forming galaxies reflects {the alternative physical conditions} -- including magnetic field configurations -- of the dominant population of star-forming galaxies in different redshift ranges. We define three galactic types, based on our reference model, with reference to ages of stellar populations. ``Normal'' late-type galaxies dominate the star formation in the nearby Universe; ``starburst'' galaxies take over at higher redshifts, up to z ~1.5; while ``protospheroidal'' galaxies dominate at high redshift. A reanalysis of data from the COSMOS field combined with literature results shows that, for each population, the data are consistent with an almost redshift-independent mean value of the parameter q_IR, which quantifies the infrared-radio correlation. However, we find a hint of an upturn of the mean q_IR at z&gt;~3.5 consistent with the predicted dimming of synchrotron emission due to cooling of relativistic electrons by inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background. The typical stellar masses increase from normal, to starburst, and to protospheroidal galaxies, accounting for the reported dependence of the mean q_IR on stellar mass. Higher values of q_IR found for high-z strongly lensed dusty galaxies selected at 500 micron might be explained by differential magnification.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ALPAKA survey II. Evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks across cosmic time: difference between cold and warm gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is supersonically turbulent. Measurements of turbulence typically rely on cold gas emission lines for low-z galaxies and warm ionized gas observations for z&gt;0 galaxies. Studies of warm gas kinematics at z&gt;0 conclude that the turbulence strongly evolves as a function of redshift, due to the increasing impact of gas accretion and mergers in the early Universe. However, recent findings suggest potential biases in turbulence measurements derived from ionized gas at high-z, impacting our understanding of turbulence origin, ISM physics and disk formation. We investigate the evolution of turbulence using velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) measurements from cold gas tracers (i.e., CO, [CI], [CII]) derived from a sample of 57 galaxy disks spanning the redshift range z=0-5. This sample consists of main-sequence and starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The comparison with current H$\alpha$ kinematic observations and existing models demonstrates that the velocity dispersion inferred from cold gas tracers differ by a factor of $\approx 3$ from those obtained using emission lines tracing warm gas. We show that stellar feedback is the main driver of turbulence measured from cold gas tracers. This is fundamentally different from the conclusions of studies based on warm gas, which had to consider additional turbulence drivers to explain the high values of $\sigma$. We present a model predicting the redshift evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks, attributing the increase of $\sigma$ with redshift to the higher energy injected by supernovae due to the elevated star-formation rate in high-z galaxies. This supernova-driven model suggests that turbulence is lower in galaxies with lower stellar mass compared to those with higher stellar mass. Additionally, it forecasts the evolution of $\sigma$ in Milky-Way like progenitors.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>

Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>

      <title>One Small Step for $Roman$; One Giant Leap for Black Holes</title>

Abstract: The $Roman$ microlensing program can detect and fully characterize black holes (BHs) that are in orbit with about 30 million solar-type and evolved stars with periods up to the mission lifetime $P&lt;T=5$ yr, and semi-major axes $a&gt;0.2$au, i.e., $P&gt; 10$ d $(M/M_\odot)^{-1/2}$, where $M$ is the BH mass. For BH companions of about 150 million later (fainter) main-sequence stars, the threshold of detection is $a&gt;0.2$ au $\times 10^{(H_{\rm Vega}-18.5)/5}$. The present $Roman$ scheduling creates a "blind spot" near periods of $P=3.5$ yr due to a 2.3-year gap in the data. It also compromises the characterization of BHs in eccentric orbits with periods $P&gt;3$ yr and peribothra within a year of the mission midpoint. I show that one can greatly ameliorate these issues by making a small adjustment to the $Roman$ observing schedule. The present schedule aims to optimize proper-motion measurements, but the adjustment proposed here would degrade these by only 4%-9%. For many cases of $P&gt;90$ d BHs, there will be discrete and/or continuous degeneracies. For G-dwarf and evolved sources, it will be straightforward to resolve these by radial-velocity (RV) follow-up observations, but such observations will be more taxing for fainter sources. Many BH-binaries in orbits of 5 yr $&lt;P&lt;10$ yr will be reliably identified as such from the $Roman$ data, but will lack precise orbits. Nevertheless, the full orbital solutions can be recovered by combining $Roman$ astrometry with RV followup observations. BH binaries with periods 10 yr $&lt;P&lt;$ 95 yr $(M/10 M_\odot)^{1/4}$ can be detected from their astrometric acceleration, but massive multi-fiber RV monitoring would be needed to distinguish them from the astrophysical background due to stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Bow-shock structure of Sgr B molecular-cloud complex in the Galactic Centre inferred from 3D CO-line kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) bubble structure of the Sgr-B molecular-cloud complex is derived by a kinematical analysis of CO-line archival cube data of the Galactic Centre (GC) observed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The line-of-sight depth is estimated by applying the face-on transformation method of radial velocity to the projected distance on the Galactic plane considering the Galactic rotation of the central molecular zone (CMZ). The 3D complex exhibits a conical-horn structure with the Sgr-B2 cloud located in the farthest end on the line of sight at radial velocity $v_{\rm lsr} \sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$, and the entire complex composes a lopsided bubble opening toward the Sun at $v_{\rm lsr}\sim 50$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight extent of the complex is $\sim 100$ pc according to the large velocity extent for several tens of km s$^{-1}$ from Sgr B2 to the outskirts. The entire complex exhibits a flattened conical bubble with full sizes $\sim 40 {\rm pc} \times 20 {\rm pc} \times 100 {\rm pc}$ in the $l$, $b$ and line-of-sight directions, respectively. Based on the 3D analysis, we propose a formation scenario of the giant molecular bubble structure due to a galactic bow shock, and suggest that the star formation in Sgr B2 was enhanced by dual-side compression of the B2 cloud by the Galactic shock wave from up-stream and expanding HII region from the down-stream side of the GC Arm I in Galactic rotation.</description>

      <title>Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>

      <title>The neutral gas phase nearest to supermassive black holes</title>

Abstract: Broad Line Regions (BLRs) are known to contain gravitationally-bound gas within r~(few) 10^2-10^3 Schwarszchild radii (Rs) near supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Photo-ionized by strong non-stellar AGN continuum, this gas emits luminous ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared lines from ionized hydrogen (and other multi-ionized atoms) that have the widest velocity profiles observed in galaxies, uniquely indicating the deep gravitational wells of SMBHs. Nearly all BLR studies focus on its ionized gas phase (hereafter BLR+), with typical masses of only a few 10-100 M_Sun, despite strong indications of neutral BLR gas reservoirs (hereafter BLR0) with M_BLR0~10^{5-6} M_Sun. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY, with its chemistry augmented using three-body reactions, to explore 1-D models of dustless BLRs, focusing on the BLR0 conditions, and the abundances of its most prevalent neutral atoms and molecules. A neutral-atom-) and molecule-rich BLR0 gas phase is found underlying the BLR+, the latter occupying only a thin outer layer of AGN-irradiated gas column densities, while the former contains the bulk of the BLR gas mass. Atomic carbon and oxygen as well as the CO molecule can reach substantial abundances in the BLR0, while their lines at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths can yield new probes of the BLR physical conditions and dynamics, unhindered by the dust absorption from outer AGN tori that readily absorb the BLR+ optical/far-ultraviolet (FUV) lines. We find that neutral-atom-rich neutral-atom-rich and even molecule-rich gas can exist in the BLR0. The corresponding spectral lines from neutral atoms and molecules promise a new spectral window of gas dynamics in the vicinity of~SMBHs unhindered by dust absorption. This may even offer the prospect of conducting novel tests of general relativity in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Stellar metallicity is a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>A Supermassive Binary Black Hole Candidate in Mrk 501</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using multifrequency observations, from radio to gamma-rays of the blazar Mrk~501, we constructed their corresponding light curves and built periodograms using RobPer and Lomb-Scargle algorithms. Long-term variability was also studied using the power density spectrum and the detrended function analysis. Using the software VARTOOLS,
  we also computed the analysis of variance, box-least squares and discrete fourier transform. The result of these techniques showed an achromatic periodicity &lt;~ 229 d. This, combined with the result of pink-color noise in the spectra, led us to propose that the periodicity was produced via a secondary eclipsing supermassive binary black hole orbiting the primary one locked inside the central engine of Mrk~501. We built a relativistic eclipsing model of this phenomenon using Jacobi elliptical functions, finding a periodic relativistic eclipse occurring every ~ 224 d in all the studied wavebands. This implies that the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves falls slightly above 0.1 mHz, well within the operational range of the upcoming LISA space-based interferometer, and as such, these gravitational waves must be considered as a prime science target for future LISA observations.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). These have enabled high-dimensional inference of galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) properties during the first billion years of our Universe. However, even using efficient, semi-numerical simulations, traditional inference approaches that compute 3D lightcones on-the-fly can take $10^5$ core hours. Here we present 21cmEMU: an emulator of several summary observables from the popular 21cmFAST simulation code. 21cmEMU takes as input nine parameters characterizing EoR galaxies, and outputs the following summary statistics: (i) the IGM mean neutral fraction; (ii) the 21-cm power spectrum; (iii) the mean 21-cm spin temperature; (iv) the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal; (v) the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs); and (vi) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All observables are predicted with sub-percent median accuracy, with a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of over 10$^4$. After validating inference results, we showcase a few applications, including: (i) quantifying the relative constraining power of different observational datasets; (ii) seeing how recent claims of a late EoR impact previous inferences; and (iii) forecasting upcoming constraints from the sixth observing season of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope. 21cmEMU is publicly-available, and is included as an alternative simulator in the public 21CMMC sampler.</description>

      <title>Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies Science with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) Space Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case for the \textit{Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies} (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions, thanks to its cold ($&lt;$40~K) 14-m primary mirror. Key Milky Way and nearby galaxies science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of star formation in feedback in the Local Universe. In addition to this science case, SALTUS would open a new window to to of Galactic and extragalactic communities in the 2030s, enable fundamentally new questions to be answered, and be a far-IR analog to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. This paper summarizes the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case and plans for notional observing programs in both guaranteed and guest (open) time.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the decametre sky at subarcminute resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largely unexplored decameter radio band (10-30 MHz) provides a unique window for studying a range of astronomical topics, such as auroral emission from exoplanets, inefficient cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, fossil radio plasma, and free-free absorption. The scarcity of low-frequency studies is mainly due to the severe perturbing effects of the ionosphere. Here we present a calibration strategy that can correct for the ionosphere in the decameter band. We apply this to an observation from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 16 to 30 MHz . The resulting image covers 330 square degrees of sky at a resolution of 45", reaching a sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. Residual ionospheric effects cause additional blurring ranging between 60 to 100". This represents an order of magnitude improvement in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to previous decameter band observations. In the region we surveyed, we have identified four fossil plasma sources. These rare sources are believed to contain old, possibly re-energised, radio plasma originating from previous outbursts of active galactic nuclei. At least three of them are situated near the center of low-mass galaxy clusters. Notably, two of these sources display the steepest radio spectral index among all the sources detected at 23 MHz. This indicates that fossil plasma sources constitute the primary population of steep-spectrum sources at these frequencies, emphasising the large discovery potential of ground-based decameter observations.</description>

Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>
