      <title>The DSSYK Model: Charge and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence (AdS/CFT) is one of the most significant findings in theoretical physics and forms the basis of this thesis. Although highly powerful, the main limitation of AdS/CFT is that AdS does not appear in the real world outside of very specific limits. This limitation justifies the attempt to generalize the holographic principle to other spacetimes. In this thesis, we will pursue this direction and seek spacetimes that have at least some connection to de Sitter (dS), whose cosmological interest is evident. dS is, in fact, not only the geometry that best represents our Universe on large scales in the present, but also during the inflationary epoch that followed the Big Bang, where our current description of Nature fails completely.
  First, we will present some basic facts about the AdS/CFT correspondence. Then, the gravitational path integral will be introduced. After presenting the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and dilaton-gravity models, a holographic link between the two will be established. Next, we will discuss the double-scaled limit of SYK, known as DSSYK. We will then consider a ``charged'' variation of SYK with Dirac fermions, for which we will determine the fermionic two-point function. After studying the thermodynamic properties of the gravitational dual of DSSYK and the quasinormal modes of massive real scalars propagating in this geometry, we will conjecture how to modify the duality when considering the Dirac version of the model, showing that several bounds constrain the space of possible dual theories. Finally, we will summarize our findings and present an outlook on possible future developments based on the results described here.</description>

      <title>Demystifying stringy miracles with eclectic flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories arising from string compactifications are subject to constraints originating from the duality transformations of string theory. Interpreting these so-called selection rules in terms of conventional symmetries has remained challenging. We show that particular selection rules in heterotic orbifolds can be explained from a subtle interplay between modular and traditional flavor symmetries within the eclectic flavor framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular symmetries are known to be powerful and have various remarkable properties. We point out that the structure of vector-valued modular forms (VVMFs) space leads to the absence of couplings which cannot be explained in terms of the usual symmetries. These modular zeros, which correspond to gaps in spaces of VVMFs, have the power of explaining certain stringy zeros, and to explain the renowned Weinberg texture that relates the Cabibbo angle to the hierarchies of the light down and strange quarks.</description>

Abstract: We show how to identify generators of bosonic VOAs associated with $T_{[n-1,1]}^{[1^n]}(SU(n))$ and $T_{[n-1,1^2]}^{[2,1^{n-1}]}(SU(n+1))$, and conjecture that the algebraic structure of these VOAs can be constructed by these generators. We also find out that the boundary VOA associated with $T_{[n-1,1]}^{[1^n]}(SU(n))$ naturally includes the bosonic VOA.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Padmanabhan Holographic Model in a BIonic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Padmanabhan has argued that a difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and the number in a bulk causes the expansion of the universe. We can reconsider this idea in a BIon system. A Bion is formed from two branes that are connected by a wormhole. Our universe may live on one of these branes. Each brane could be formed by joining lower-dimensional branes, such as $D_1$ ones. By joining $D_1$ branes, a $D_n$ brane is formed, and some amounts of energy are released. Then, perhaps some dimensions are compacted, and a certain amount of energy is released. These energies cause a significant difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk of branes. This causes the evolution of the universe and many changes in thermodynamic parameters, such as entropy, as well as cosmic parameters, including the Hubble constant. We obtain the standard form of the Hubble parameter and its dependency on redshift in a Bion system.</description>

      <title>Bulk-cone singularities and echoes from AdS exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The region near a black hole horizon may be modified by quantum gravity effects that resolve the singularity. Such geometry may be represented by an exotic compact object. Because the horizon is enclosed by a photon sphere, it is difficult to probe this region directly. In this paper, we develop a method to study the region inside the photon sphere by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence. We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole. We compute the corresponding bulk wave functions both via the WKB approximation and through numerical analysis and observe the bulk-cone singularities and echoes explicitly.</description>

      <title>$Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ modular inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate inflation models governed by the Siegel modular group $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$. The $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ group extends the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ framework from one modulus to three moduli while preserving the hyperbolic geometry of the K\"ahler potential, allowing for the construction of cosmological $\alpha$-attractor models. In this context, we use genus $g=2$ absolute invariants to construct inflationary potentials within specific subspaces of the Siegel moduli space. These models are driven by the imaginary components of the moduli $\tau$ and naturally yield plateau-like potentials consistent with Planck 2018 observations in large field limit. We employ two-dimensional complex subspaces to realize E-model and T-model like two-field inflation scenarios. We explore the subspace of complex dimension one to construct a modified polynomial $\alpha$-attractor model, which can accommodate the larger spectral index $n_s$ favored by recent ACT and SPT data, particularly in the larger $N$ regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the shell formula -- a framework capable of providing a unified description for various partition functions whose pole structures are classified by Young diagrams of arbitrary dimension. This formalism encompasses a wide range of physical systems, including instanton partition functions of 5d pure super Yang-Mills theory with classical gauge groups, as well as gauge origami configurations such as the magnificent four, tetrahedron instantons, Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and spiked instantons.</description>

      <title>A topological perspective on bulk boundary thermodynamic equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an exact duality between the extended thermodynamics of five-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes and the thermodynamic framework of the dual boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The thermodynamics of the dual CFT involves two central charges originating from the trace anomaly. We demonstrate a precise correspondence between the extended first laws on the bulk and boundary sides. Moreover, the topological charges of the CFT thermodynamics, associated with the phase transition and critical point, coincide with those of the corresponding bulk black hole.</description>

      <title>Entanglement wedge cross section triangle information and holographic entanglement of assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a non-negative and upper-bounded entanglement signal in holography which is defined as a combination of entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) for a tripartite mixed state $ABE$: $\mathrm{EI}_{\Delta}(A:B|E) = \mathrm{EWCS}(A:EB) + \mathrm{EWCS}(B:EA) - \mathrm{EWCS}(E:AB)$. This quantity is an analogue of conditional mutual information (CMI) and shares similar mathematical structures in both quantum information theory and holography. We show that CMI is upper bounded by a quantum information quantity, the entanglement of assistance, which quantifies the entanglement that can be generated between two parties $A$ and $B$, given assistance from a third party $E$. We prove that $\mathrm{EI}_{\Delta}$ is also upper bounded by the entanglement of assistance in the canonical purification state. We analyze its upper bound by maximizing $\mathrm{EI}_{\Delta}(A:B|E)$ over all configurations of the auxiliary subsystem $E$ in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. The maximized $\mathrm{EI}_{\Delta}$ displays a rich phase structure governed by the cross ratio $X_{AB}$: it vanishes below a critical threshold and, beyond a second phase transition point, saturates the bound of entanglement of assistance. We comment on the interpretation of $\mathrm{EI}_{\Delta}$ as characterizing the assisted bipartite quantum entanglement between $A$ and $B$ with the help of $E$.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>On prethermal time crystals from semi-holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a pair of almost dissipationless oscillating modes at low temperatures in both the shear and sound channels of a hybrid quantum system, comprised of a weakly self-interacting perturbative sector coupled to strongly self-interacting holographic degrees of freedom described by a black hole geometry. We argue that these modes realize prethermal time-crystal behavior in semiholographic systems without fine-tuning and can be observed by measuring operators that probe either the hard (perturbative) or the soft (holographic) sector. We also find novel Gregory Laflamme type instabilities that lead to the formation of inhomogeneities at higher temperatures. These results provide evidence that black holes with planar horizons and dynamical boundary conditions can develop both inhomogeneous and metastable time crystal phases over a wide range of temperatures set by an intermediate scale. Furthermore, they suggest that such phases can be realized without external driving in nonAbelian plasmas of asymptotically free gauge theories in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Momentum Space Correlation Functions in 2D Galilean Conformal Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA) arises as a controlled nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic conformal algebra. In this paper, we initiate the study of momentum space correlation functions in two-dimensional GCA. We derive and solve momentum space Ward identities to obtain two-point and three-point functions. However, relating them to position space correlation functions presents a challenge as Fourier transforms of the latter do not exist. This is resolved by analytically continuing the boost eigenvalues to imaginary values. In this regime, the Fourier transform of the position space two-point and three-point functions exist and match exactly with the momentum space two-point and three-point function obtained by solving the Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partition function associated with the democratic formulation of M-theory, focusing on its global definition and quantization properties. Using a path integral representation that makes manifest the underlying cohomological structure, we analyze the coupled system of form fields $C_4$ and $C_7$ and its associated gauge transformations. We show that the resulting description is naturally captured by a non-linear differential cocycle, reflecting the presence of a quadratic coupling between electric and magnetic degrees of freedom. This framework provides a transparent characterization of the global structure of the theory, clarifies the role of higher-form gauge symmetry, and allows for a consistent definition of the partition function in terms of higher-dimensional auxiliary manifolds.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on dilaton gravity at finite cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of two-dimensional quantum gravity at finite cutoff remains an open problem. We revisit this question in JT gravity from two perspectives: the closed-channel bulk path integral and the path integral over boundary curves. First, we study the radial evolution of a closed universe and derive the trumpet wavefunction as a transition amplitude between a geodesic boundary and a finite Dirichlet boundary. Our analysis recovers the Hartle--Hawking wavefunction without imposing asymptotic boundary conditions, allowing the trumpet to be glued to a cap wavefunction to reconstruct the smooth disk. Second, we derive an exact Riccati equation for the extrinsic curvature of a finite-cutoff boundary curve in the Euclidean Poincar\'e disk. A WKB expansion of this equation yields all perturbative corrections in the cutoff parameter and captures nonperturbative effects. From this, we compute the quadratic boundary action and the one-loop partition function at finite cutoff, finding agreement with both the bulk approach and the expected one-loop effective action for the $T\bar{T}$ deformation of the Schwarzian theory. Extracting lessons from JT gravity, we then argue that similar relationships hold for general dilaton gravities with arbitrary potentials $V(\phi)$ and propose an exact expression for their finite cutoff partition functions. We finally investigate several signatures of UV completeness in these settings, introducing a canonical quantization approach within the finite cutoff framework.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines.

      <title>Notes on off-shell conformal integrals and correlation functions at five points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study five-point off-shell conformal integrals and associated half-BPS correlation functions at the two-loop order in the 't Hooft coupling expansion in maximal supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We construct a basis of uniform transcendental, pure integrals, comprising six distinct topologies, through the method of diagonalizing leading singularities under the constraints of conformal invariance, which serve as basis integrals for conformally-symmetric observables at five points and two loops. By employing different conformal frame fixing choices, this integral basis can be mapped onto known two-loop four-massive-particle Feynman integral families. Subsequently, their integrated results are computed using the method of canonical differential equations and integration-by-parts reduction. We present for the first time the integrated results for the two-loop five-point half-BPS correlators, encompassing both maximal and non-maximal sectors, at symbol level.</description>

      <title>Relating auxiliary field formulations of $4d$ duality-invariant and $2d$ integrable field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxiliary field techniques have recently gained interest in four-dimensional non-linear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable sigma models. In these settings, coupling a suitable ``seed'' theory to auxiliary fields provides a powerful mechanism to generate infinite families of models while preserving key dynamical properties, such as electromagnetic duality invariance in four dimensions and classical integrability in two dimensions. Deformations induced through auxiliary fields are closely related to $T\bar{T}$-like deformations and, in two dimensions, also to their higher-spin generalisations. In this paper, we analyse and clarify the relations between different auxiliary field formulations in two and four dimensions, showing how they are governed by Legendre transformations of the interaction functions combined with appropriate field redefinitions. In four-dimensional electrodynamics, we establish a correspondence between the auxiliary field model of Russo and Townsend and the Ivanov--Zupnik formalism. In two dimensions, we develop the analogue of the Ivanov--Zupnik $\mu$-frame to deform Principal Chiral, symmetric-space, non-Abelian T-dual, and (bi-)Yang-Baxter sigma models. We discuss how integrability is preserved and use properties of the $\mu$-frame to further extend known families of integrable deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the analytic structure of tree-level flat-space wavefunction coefficients (WFCs), with particular attention to fermionic operators, and derive cutting rules for internal-fermion lines. Building on these results, we set up an iterative procedure that, starting from the flat-space S-matrix, reconstructs the 3- and 4-point WFCs with the correct partial- and total-energy poles and satisfying the requisite cutting rules. Consequently, the "four-particle test" for flat-space WFCs imposes no additional constraints beyond the consistency of the flat-space S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Boundary Correlators in (EA)dS space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we bootstrap de Sitter wavefunction coefficients (WFCs) involving fermionic operators. Starting with a fixed total-energy pole order, we systematically impose the conformal Ward identities (CWI) together with cutting-rule constraints. We derive the relevant cutting rules for fermionic exchange for the first time, enabling a complete determination of fermionic three- and four-point WFCs. We show that CWI fixes the leading total-energy-pole residue to the flat-space amplitude and subleading residues to curvature induced corrections to bulk vertices. The structure of the Ward-Takahashi identities are similarly fully determined. As an application, we derive four massless spin-1/2 WFC due to graviton exchange. We also revisit the tension between conserved spin-3/2 operators and de Sitter geometry. We demonstrate that the reality conditions appropriate to dS and Euclidean AdS (EAdS) lead to distinct three-point WFCs for two spin-3/2 operators and the stress tensor. Consequently, the residue of the leading total-energy pole for the four-point WFC receives graviton- and photon-exchange contributions with opposite signs in dS, whereas they appear with the same sign in EAdS. This reproduces the classic result of Pilch, van Nieuwenhuizen, and Sohnius in an explicitly on-shell form.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian soft radiation data for a celestial theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial holography posits that the long-distance behavior of gauge and gravity theories is dictated by two-dimensional conformal field theories defined on the celestial sphere. For non-abelian gauge theories, this proposal is verified, to all perturbative orders, by dipole color correlations in the infrared factor of non-abelian scattering amplitudes, which are given by a correlator of matrix-valued vertex operators in a free-boson theory on the sphere. Decades of high-order gauge-theory calculations have provided a number of further results that can be used to test and constrain a possible celestial theory: they include explicit expressions for soft emission currents up to three particles, and up to three loops for single soft emission. In this paper, we analyze this trove of data, appropriately translated in the celestial language, and we use them to extract information on the celestial theory. In particular, we show that all logarithms arising in the loop expansion of the single soft current can be reabsorbed in the scale choices for the $d$-dimensional coupling, casting some doubt on the need for a logarithmic celestial theory. We then note that the celestial OPEs suggested by the structure of multiple emission currents in collinear limits are never ambiguous, but involve coefficients depending on gluon energy fractions, which break holomorphic factorization, as well as associativity when double limits are taken. Strongly-ordered soft limits recover associativity, but suffer from ambiguities already discussed in earlier literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(d+1)$-dimensional field theory with a periodic spatial dimension may be approximated by a $d$-dimensional theory with a truncated Kaluza-Klein tower of $k$ fields; as $k\to\infty$, one recovers the original $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. One may similarly expect that $\operatorname U(1)$-valued Maxwell theory may be approximated by $\mathbb Z_k$-valued gauge theory and that, as $k\to\infty$, one recovers the original Maxwell theory. However, this fails: the $k\to\infty$ limit of $\mathbb Z_k$-valued gauge theory is flat Maxwell theory with no local degrees of freedom. We instead construct field theories $\mathcal T_k$ such that, with appropriate matter couplings, the $k\to\infty$ limit does recover Maxwell theory in the absence of magnetic monopoles (but with possible Wilson loops), and show that $\mathcal T_k$ can be understood as Maxwell theory with the insertion of a certain nonlocal operator that projects out principal $\operatorname U(1)$-bundles that do not arise from principal $\mathbb Z_k$-bundles sectors (in particular, projecting out sectors with monopole charges).</description>

Abstract: We show that a bound impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate can be directly mapped to an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a relativistic quantum field. We provide explicit experimental parameters for an implementation using ${}^{39}\text{K}$ impurities coupled to a ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ condensate via finite-time Feshbach tuning. As an application, we study the extraction of vacuum entanglement from distant regions of the condensate and find viable parameters for the implementation of entanglement harvesting.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation of Freely Falling Atoms in Bardeen Regular Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Fusion in a (2+1)-dimensional Lattice Model with Generalized Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</description>

Abstract: This short report is dedicated to the 40th anniversary of International Journal of Modern Physics A (IJMPA) and Modern Physics Letters A (MPLA). While the report is based on a series of papers[1-8], its content reflects my personal viewpoints. Therefore I am solely responsible for all the statements in the report. In this report we discuss conservation of energies in a curved spacetime including general relativity. We argue that the matter energy is not necessarily conserved in a curved space time due to a lack of time translational invariance, and adding energy of gravitational fields to recover the conservation law of energies fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem. We show that there exists conserved quantities associated with the matter</description>

      <title>The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with Non-Invertible Selection Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which the quark and lepton flavor structure and suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are governed by non-invertible selection rules. By implementing such non-group-like fusion rules for matter fields, arising from gauging the outer automorphism $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, we obtain realistic Yukawa textures that reproduce the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings while ensuring diagonal soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking masses and hence suppressing dangerous FCNC processes. We analyze mass insertion parameters under random $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients and find that all flavor-violating effects are consistent with experimental limits on processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$ and meson mixings. We show that the Yukawa textures and soft terms remain stable under renormalization group evolution. Our results demonstrate that non-invertible selection rules provide a compelling new mechanism to address both the flavor structure and FCNC problems in supersymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Chaos, Ito-Stratonovich dilemma, and topological supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that the formalism of the generalized transfer operator (GTO) of dynamical systems (DS) theory, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of arbitrary form, belongs to the family of cohomological topological field theories (TFT) -- a class of models at the intersection of algebraic topology and high-energy physics. This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive "pressure", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for Constrained Path Integrals in Minisuperspace Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed evaluation of constrained minisuperspace path integrals in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and in biaxial Bianchi IX quantum cosmology, employing the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute the relevant functional determinants. In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(\phi)=m^{2}\phi^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Analytical Forms and Degeneracy of Quasinormal Modes for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes for massless spin particles using the unified equation. We derive analytical expressions for both the quasinormal mode frequencies and the radial wave functions. The frequencies are determined exclusively by the black hole parameters and the quantum numbers $n$ and $m$, while the radial wave functions also depend on the quantum number $k$, indicating a degeneracy in frequency. For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties. This implies that, through the observation of quasinormal modes, one can not only determine the black hole's parameters but also observe the phenomenon in which one type of particle reproduces the quasinormal mode of another. Our work thus provides a theoretical foundation for understanding this mimicking behavior as well.</description>

It is found that for spin particles, curved spacetime induces an effective complex potential analogous to a Coulomb field. While the real part of this potential contributes a real logarithmic term to the phase, the imaginary part gives rise to a corresponding imaginary logarithmic term. Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure. Insights gained from these experiments could, in turn, shed light on the scattering of other massless fields (e.g., gravitational waves) by actual black holes.</description>

Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Investigation of quantum chaos in local and non-local Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of quantum chaos within Ising spin chains subjected to transverse and longitudinal fields, incorporating both local (nearest-neighbor) and non-local (long-range) couplings. While local Ising models may exhibit integrable or chaotic dynamics contingent on interaction strengths and field parameters, systems with non-local interactions generally display a stronger propensity toward chaos, even when the non-local couplings are weak. By examining the distribution of energy level spacings through the level spacing ratio, we delineate the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes and characterize the emergence of quantum chaos in these systems. Our analysis demonstrates that non-local couplings facilitate faster operator spreading and more intricate dynamical behavior, enabling these systems to approach maximal chaos more readily than their local counterparts. Additionally, we analyze Krylov complexity as a dynamical probe of chaos, observing a characteristic peak followed by a plateau at late times in chaotic regimes. This behavior provides a quantitative means to distinguish between integrable and chaotic phases, with the growth rate and saturation level of the complexity serving as effective indicators. Our findings underscore the role of non-local interactions in accelerating the onset of chaos and modifying dynamical complexity in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>On Critical Temperature and Finite Size Scaling of Continuous Spin $2d$ Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the critical temperature $T_c$ of continuous spin $2d$ square-lattice Ising model using Monte-Carlo simulation. We have considered spins $s$ in a bounded interval, where $s \in [-1,+1]$ in square-lattice configuration with periodic boundary condition. We have observed that the critical temperature $T_c$ is approximately $0.925$, showing a clear second order phase transition. Considering finite size scaling, we have also obtained the critical exponents associated with susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization and we find that these values are in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained for the standard $2d$ Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Phase-space description of photon emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between charged particles and light occur in real space and time, yet quantum field theory usually describes them in momentum space. Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics.</description>

Abstract: Absorption of an isolated bulk magnetic skyrmion into an empty domain wall in a chiral ferromagnetic system is studied using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with and without the demagnetization effect taken into account. The full phase diagram of creation versus repulsion or annihilation is mapped out in case of both Bloch-type and N\'eel-type DMI, with and without demagnetization. Finally, the unstable domain wall, realizable with a setup of several external magnets, contains the theoretical possibility of producing a 1-dimensional version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which in turn can create a number of skyrmion-anti-skyrmion pairs engulfed in the domain wall: We denote them domain-wall-skyrmion-anti-domain-wall-skyrmion pairs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands and Thermodynamics of the Black Hole in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic properties and the entanglement island of a black hole in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, analyzing key thermodynamic quantities such as the Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy, as well as the mass-horizon radius relation. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions of QCD in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of low-energy QCD matter in strong magenetic fields is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), a periodic array of neutral pion domain walls (chiral solitons) perpendicular to the magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion phase, in which Skyrmions are induced on top of the CSL. Previously found domain-wall Skyrmions are bosons with the baryon number two. In this paper, we show that the minimum domain-wall Skyrmions are fermions with the baryon number one; a bosonic domain-wall Skyrmion can be separated without cost of energy into two fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions attached on the opposite sides of a chiral soliton. The phase boundary between the CSL and domain-wall Skyrmion phases is unchanged. In the chiral limit, the CSL reduces to a linearly dependent neutral pion on the direction of the magnetic field, while fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions sit in an equal distance of a half period.</description>

      <title>Rotationally invariant dynamical lattice regulators for Euclidean quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamical-lattice regulator (DLR) for Euclidean quantum field theories on a fixed hypercubic graph $\Lambda \simeq \mathbb{Z}^d$, in which the embedding $x:\Lambda \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is promoted to a dynamical field and integrated over subject to shape-regularity constraints. The total action is local on $\Lambda$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.
  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,\Phi)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $\Lambda$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations; in particular, in $d=4$ we recover the standard one-loop $\beta$-function in a scalar $\phi^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report $d=2$ proof-of-concept simulations showing a well-behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data II: collider templates and Modal analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures of massive particles during inflation are highly informative targets for cosmological experiments. With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35\sigma$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we work out some variations on the discussion of the C-field flux densities in the Sati-Schreiber program. We start by explaining the need for global completion of the field content: the fluxes, the gauge potentials and the gauge transformations on the worldvolume of a single M5 brane in eleven-dimensional supergravity, and how this is encoded by the choice of flux quantization law.
  Assuming Hypothesis H that the 4-flux in M-Theory is flux quantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the three-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we generalize some previous calculations known in the literature to include twisting by background gravity and placing M5 branes on orbifolds. We show that the null concordances of cohomotopically charged fluxes give rise to the traditional gauge potentials and the null concordances of concordances give rise to the corresponding gauge transformations via surjections, in the cases of tangentially twisted cohomotopy, twistorial cohomotopy and equivariant twistorial cohomotopy. We construct the surjections explicitly for these cases and check the consistency relations with the corresponding Bianchi identities.
  Thus, we show how the traditional formulas for the local gauge potentials on M5 brane worldvolume on curved spacetimes and orbifolds are indeed reproduced by the homotopy theory and, as such, become amenable to global completion in cohomotopical charge quantization.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalized perturbative framework for gravitational shadows in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Building upon the recent two-parameter perturbative framework of Kobialko et al. \cite{Kobialko:2024zhc}, this work extends the expansion in particle energy and metric deviation to encompass arbitrary, simultaneous deformations of all metric functions. By relaxing the common restriction of a fixed area radius $(\beta(r) = r^2)$, our formalism applies to a significantly broader class of alternative gravity theories and exotic compact objects. We derive analytical formulae for the massive shadow radius up to the second order in the deformation parameter, explicitly revealing the phenomenological signatures that arise from the coupling between temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The key result is that the distinct energy dependence of the massive shadow provides a powerful method to disentangle these different types of geometric deformations, breaking observational degeneracies inherent in the photon shadow alone. We demonstrate this principle with applications to traversable wormholes and canonical scalar-tensor solutions, showing how each produces a unique, distinguishable energy-dependent fingerprint. This generalized framework provides a robust, theory-agnostic tool for testing strong-field gravity. It offers a clear methodology for reconstructing metric parameters from potential multi-messenger observations of massive particle shadows.</description>

Abstract: We present an alternative dimensional reduction that yields an effective theory of dilatons in a two-dimensional de Sitter background. Specifically, by performing an S-wave reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity, we obtain free massless dilatons in the Nariai static patch, and a dynamically evolving dilatons in the past Milne wedge. We then propose a (Nariai) static patch worldsheet formulation in terms of CFTs with SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) deformed Hamiltonians on the cylinder. A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the (Nariai) static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer. Using the similar reduction, we have also obtained a Schwarzian action coupled to free massless dilatons in the near horizon near extremal limit of four dimensional charged AdS black holes. The worldsheet description for the same has been proposed and discussed in \cite{Das:2025cuq}. We also comment on how different notions of worldsheet time may themselves be \textit{emergent}.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.03401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Via constructing an explicit Lagrangian for which the perturbation equations are analogues of a scalar field propagating in a planar black hole space-time, it is found that all planar black holes conformal to a Painlev\'e--Gullstrand type line element can be realized as analogue metrics. We also introduce the concept of holographic entanglement entropy for planar black-hole space-times. This is valid for an arbitrary choice of conformal and blackening factor, thereby vastly extending the number of known examples of explicitly known analogue metrics.</description>

      <title>Test fields and naked singularities: is the second law the cosmic censor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been claimed that a Kerr-Newman black hole can generically be overspun by neutral test fields, and it has been argued that even when backreactions are taken into account, the black hole can still be destroyed. In this paper, we revisit the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for a Kerr-Newman black hole with a test scalar field and a neutrino field, and point out that the assumption in previous work regarding the energy and angular momentum of the test fields absorbed by the black hole violates the second law of black hole thermodynamics. By solving the test scalar field and neutrino field near the event horizon explicitly, we demonstrate that an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole cannot be overspun by a test scalar field but can be destroyed by a neutrino field. Our results indicate that the condition required to overspin an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole coincides with the condition needed to violate the second law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we observe that such a violation of the second law might inevitably result in a breakdown of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is important to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the thermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics is a crucial and foundational aspect of black hole physics, yet its observational verification remains exceptionally challenging. The photon sphere of a black hole, a manifestation of strong gravitational effects, is intrinsically linked to its shadow, which has been directly captured through observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope. Investigating black hole thermodynamics from a gravitational perspective presents an intriguing avenue for research. This paper obtains an analytical formula for the coexistence curve and investigates the relationship between the thermodynamic phase transition and the photon sphere of a black hole with quantum anomaly. It proposes that the photon sphere encodes information about the black hole phase transition, arguing that the change in the photon sphere radius can serve as an order parameter characterizing the black hole's phase transition.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-d E/d V$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$. In this case, if $\alpha&gt;0$, the effective pressure is always negative, but if $\alpha&lt;0$, it is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes surrounded by skewed dark matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Primary hairs may create echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most scenarios studied so far, the appearance of echoes in the ringdown signal requires modifications external to the black hole itself, such as the presence of matter in the near-horizon region, quantum field clouds, or exotic compact objects like wormholes that effectively introduce additional peaks in the effective potential. In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise in a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet hair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in such a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes without invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics. Using both the higher-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test fields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel mechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the ringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static, spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate "clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Birefringence in a de Sitter Background with Chern-Simons Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is deformed to a logarithmically modified self-adjoint operator \begin{equation*} F_\beta(H) = H + \beta H \log \frac{H}{E_*} \end{equation*} for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$ and a fixed reference scale $E_* &gt; 0$. Dynamical phases acquire energy-dependent factors $\exp[-it\beta E \log(E/E_*)]$, whose rapid variation across the spectrum suppresses interference between distinct energies through a non-stationary-phase mechanism. Stationary-phase analysis shows that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$ when $|\beta|$ is large.
  Since $F_\beta(H)$ is self-adjoint for every real $\beta$, the evolution operator $U_\beta(t) = \exp[-itF_\beta(H)]$ is unitary. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- Hilbert-space inner products, projection operators, the Born rule -- remains unchanged. Decoherence arises as suppression of interference terms in coarse-grained observables and decoherence functionals, not as norm loss or stochastic collapse. Physical motivation for logarithmic spectral deformations comes from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections introducing $\log E$ terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses with complex actions generating spectral factors involving $\log(E/E_{\text{P}})$. The mechanism is illustrated with two-level systems, quartic oscillators, FRW minisuperspace models, and Schwarzschild-interior-type Hamiltonians. Current superconducting-qubit coherence times constrain $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-5}$; trapped ions, NV centers, and cold atoms could strengthen this to $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <title>An integrable hierarchy associated with loop extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14108</link>

Abstract: A hierarchy of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable equations is constructed using the loop extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. This hierarchy includes $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Liouville, sinh-Gordon, cosh-Gordon, and, in particular, the mKdV equations. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded KdV equation is also derived from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equation via the Miura transformation. We present explicit formulas for the conserved charges of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-KdV and $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equations. A distinctive feature of these $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable systems is the existence of conserved charges with nontrivial grading.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagators resummed with nontrivial boundary wavefunctions in a constant electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antiparticles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the additional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the simple one-loop calculation captures the pair production effect.</description>
