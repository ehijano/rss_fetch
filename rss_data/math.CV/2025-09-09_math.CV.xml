      <title>Rigidity for compact hyperbolic complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformation behavior of compact hyperbolic complex manifolds. Let $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \Delta$ be a smooth family of compact complex manifolds over the unit disk in $\mathbb{C}$, and $H$ a compact hyperbolic complex manifold. Then the $H$-locus $\{t\in\Delta: X_t\cong H\}$ is either at most a discrete subset of $\Delta$ or the whole $\Delta$. For a smooth family over a compact Riemann surface $Y$, its $H$-locus is either at most finite or the whole $Y$. Furthermore, if $Y$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve, then we conjecture that the $H$-locus is empty or the whole $Y$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for Loewner evolutions with complex linear drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic Loewner evolutions on the complex plane driven by complex-valued functions. This model can be viewed as a generalization of real-driven Loewner evolutions in the upper half-plane, or as the deterministic analogue of complex-driven Schramm-Loewner evolutions. First, we contribute to the already known theory of such evolutions. We establish a sufficient condition for drivers in the $C^1$-class to create a two-sided simple curve. By constructing a counterexample in the $C^0$-class, we demonstrate that the same condition is not necessary and discuss an alternative necessary and sufficient condition for $C^0$-drivers that create two-sided curves.
  Second, we analyze the evolutions driven by the one-parameter family of complex linear drivers $\{ct\}_{c \in \mathbb C}$. We show that the geometries of the generated hulls differ significantly from the chordal real-driven case. Although each complex linear driver creates a two-sided curve, the geometry of the generated curve exhibits three distinct geometric phases depending on the complex parameter $c$: a simple phase, a simple with one end spiraling phase, and a third new exotic variant. In this exotic phase, one part of the curve is simple while the other part forms a Jordan curve rooted at the origin. After forming the Jordan curve, this part ceases to grow while disconnecting an open set of positive area from infinity for arbitrarily large times. We determine the phase boundaries in terms of $c$ via the signs of an explicit expression. Within the H\"older-$1/2$-class, we improve the upper bound on a constant sufficient to ensure that the driver creates a two-sided simple curve.</description>

      <title>On some $q$-analog of an initial value problem with infinite order irregular singularity and Mahler transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of $q$-difference-differential equations in two complex variables is studied, under the action of a so-called Mahler transform on time variable. The appearance of a leading formal $q$-difference operator of irregular type in the equation guarantees the existence of a formal solution to the main problem in time variable, which turns out to be obtained after a $q$-analog of Borel-Laplace procedure. Such formal solution to the main problem is $G_q$-summable along certain directions. The $G_q$-sums of such formal solutions do not in general satisfy the initial problem but rather turns out to be the analytic solutions to some related pseudo $q$-difference-differential equation.</description>

      <title>On Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies of $2$-dimensional toroidal groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A toroidal group is a generalization of a complex torus, and is obtained as the quotient of the complex Euclidean space $mathbb{C}^n$ by a discrete subgroup. Toroidal groups with finite-dimensional cohomology, called theta toroidal groups, are known to exhibit behavior analogous to that of complex tori. We compute Bott--Chern and Aeppli cohomologies for $2$-dimensional non-compact theta toroidal groups.</description>

      <title>Entire solutions of a certain type differential-difference equation and differential-difference analogue of Bruck conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we find out the precise form of the finite order entire solutions of the following differential-difference equation \[f^{(k)}(z)=\sideset{}{^n_{j=0}}{\sum} a_j f(z+jc),\] where $a_0, a_1,\ldots,a_n(\neq 0)\in\mathbb{C}$. Also in the paper we study the differential-difference analogue of Br\"{u}ck conjecture and derive a uniqueness result of finite order entire function $f(z)$ having a Borel exceptional small function of $f(z)$, when $f^{(k)}(z)$ and $\sideset{}{^n_{j=0}}{\sum} a_j f(z+jc)$ share a small function of $f(z)$. The obtained results, significantly generalize and improve the results due to Liu and Dong (Some results related to complex differential-difference equations of certain types, Bull. Korean Math. Soc., 51 (5) (2014), 1453-1467). Some examples are given to ensure the necessity of the condition (s) of our main results.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous uniformization of chord-arc curves and BMO Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article surveys and develops the use of simultaneous uniformization for the study of chord-arc curves in the BMO Teichm\"uller space. The method of simultaneous uniformization provides a unified complex-analytic framework in which chord-arc curves are parametrized by their BMO embeddings and the logarithm of derivatives of these embeddings form a biholomorphic image in the Banach space of BMO functions. We review this correspondence and its consequences, such as the relation to reparametrizations by strongly quasisymmetric homeomorphisms, in a rather self-contained manner in order to highlight the coherence of the approach.
  The main new contribution of this exposition concerns the Cauchy transform of BMO functions on a chord-arc curve. We show that the Cauchy transform is expressed through the derivative of the biholomorphic map arising from simultaneous uniformization, and consequently depends holomorphically on the variation of the chord-arc curve. This result connects classical singular integral operators with the complex structure of Teichm\"uller spaces and illustrates the effectiveness of the method. We also outline the parallel theory in the VMO Teichm\"uller space, which exhibits further structural properties.</description>

      <title>On holomorphicity of Hartogs series satisfying algebraic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a formal power series in one variable whose coefficients are holomorphic functions in a given multidimensional complex domain. Assume the following two conditions on the series. (C1) The restriction of the series at each point of a dense subset of the domain converges in an open disk of a fixed radius. (C2) The series is algebraic over the ring of holomophic functions on the direct product space of the domain and the disk. The main theorem of the present note is that the series defines a holomorphic function on the direct product space. We also give an example where the condition (C2) is essentially necessary.</description>

      <title>On some connections between Kobayashi geometry and pluripotential theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some connections between Kobayashi geometry and the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation. Among the results we obtain through these connections are: $(i)$~a theorem on the continuous extension up to $\partial{D}$ of a proper holomorphic map $F: D\longrightarrow \Omega$ between domains with $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(D) &lt; \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Omega)$, and $(ii)$~a result that establishes the existence of bounded domains with ``nice'' boundary geometry on which H\"older regularity of the solutions to the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation fails. The first, a result in Kobayashi geometry, relies upon an auxiliary construction that involves solving the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation with H\"older estimates. The second result relies crucially on a bound for the Kobayashi metric.</description>

      <title>Seeking a quadratic refinement of Sendov's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture of Sendov states that if a polynomial has all its roots in the unit disk and if $\beta$ is one of those roots, then within one unit of $\beta$ lies a root of the polynomial's derivative. If we define $r(\beta)$ to be the greatest possible distance between $\beta$ and the closest root of the derivative, then Sendov's conjecture claims that $r(\beta) \le 1$.
  In this paper, we conjecture that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ so that $r(\beta) \le 1-c\beta(1-\beta)$ for all $\beta \in [0,1]$. We find such constants for complex polynomials of degree $2$ and $3$, for real polynomials of degree $4$, for all polynomials whose roots lie on a line, for all polynomials with exactly one distinct critical point, and when $\beta$ is sufficiently close to $1$. In addition, we show that experimental data suggests that $c\approx0.233$.</description>

      <title>Levi Flat Structures via Structure Sheaves: Differential Complexes, Convexity, and Global Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Levi flat structures from the perspective of structure sheaves. We employ formal integrability to construct a class of differential complexes, thereby providing a resolution for the structure sheaf of a basic vector bundle. Drawing inspiration from Morse theory and Grauert's convexity, we introduce a notion of convexity that fully exploits Levi flatness, which ensures the global exactness of the differential complex and demonstrates Sobolev regularity in the compact case. As applications, we establish the global solvability of the Treves complex, and derive results on singular cohomology, as well as the extension problem for canonical forms in the elliptic case.</description>

      <title>Commutant lifting, interpolation, and perturbations on the polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental theorem on commutant lifting due to Sarason does not carry over to the setting of the polydisc. This paper presents two classifications of commutant lifting in several variables. The first classification links the lifting problem to the contractivity of certain linear functionals. The second one transforms it into nonnegative real numbers via a distance formula. We also solve the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem for bounded analytic functions on the polydisc. Along the way, we solve a perturbation problem for bounded analytic functions. Commutant lifting and interpolation on the polydisc solve two well-known problems in Hilbert function space theory.</description>
