      <title>Tara Polaris expeditions: Sustained decadal observations of the coupled Arctic system in rapid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled Arctic system is in rapid transition and is set to undergo further dramatic changes over the coming decades. These changes will lead most likely to an ice-free ocean in summer, expected before mid-century. The Arctic will become more strongly influenced by atmospheric and oceanographic processes characteristic of mid-latitudes, increasing the prevalence of contaminants and new biological species. This ongoing transition of the Arctic to a new state necessitates systematic monitoring of all sentinels (variables that make an essential contribution to characterizing the Earth's state) to improve our understanding of the system, enhance forecasting and support knowledge-based decisions. Here, we describe a sustained multi-decadal observation program to be implemented on the Tara Polar Station between 2026 and 2046. The monitoring program is designed as a series of year-long drift expeditions, called Tara Polaris, in the central Arctic Ocean, covering all seasons. The multidisciplinary data will bridge ecological, geochemical, biological, and physical parameters and processes in the atmosphere, sea ice and ocean. In addition, data collected with consistent methodologies over a 20-year period will make it possible to distinguish long-term trends from seasonal and interannual variability. In this paper, we discuss specific measurement challenges in each compartment (i.e., atmosphere, sea ice and ocean) along key sentinels and the most pressing scientific questions to be addressed. The expected outcomes of the Tara Polaris program will enable us to understand and quantify the main feedbacks of the coupled Arctic system, with their seasonal and interannual trends and spatial variability.</description>

      <title>Beta-coalescents when sample size is large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sweepstakes reproduction refers to a highly skewed individual recruitment success without involving natural selection and may apply to individuals in broadcast spawning populations characterised by Type III survivorship. We consider an extension of the model of sweepstakes reproduction for a haploid panmictic population of constant size $N$; the extension also works as an alternative to the Wright-Fisher model. Our model incorporates an upper bound on the random number of potential offspring (juveniles) produced by a given individual. Depending on how the bound behaves relative to the total population size, we obtain the Kingman coalescent, an incomplete Beta-coalescent, or the (complete) Beta-coalescent. We argue that applying such an upper bound is biologically reasonable. Moreover, we estimate the error of the coalescent approximation. The error estimates reveal that convergence can be slow, and small sample size can be sufficient to invalidate convergence, for example if the stated bound is of the form $N/\log N$. We use simulations to investigate the effect of increasing sample size on the site-frequency spectrum. When the limit is a Beta-coalescent, the site frequency spectrum will be as predicted by the limiting tree even though the full coalescent tree may deviate from the limiting one. When in the domain of attraction of the Kingman coalescent the effect of increasing sample size depends on the effective population size as has been noted in the case of the Wright-Fisher model. Conditioning on the population ancestry (the random ancestral relations of the entire population at all times) may have little effect on the site-frequency spectrum for the models considered here (as evidenced by simulation results).</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can persistent functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling persistent and discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce structural and functional persistence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and persist, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial comparison of general galled trees, time-consistent galled trees, and simplex time-consistent galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted binary phylogenetic networks are extensions of rooted binary trees, adding reticulation nodes that are designed to represent evolutionary processes that involve hybridization events. Enumerative combinatorics studies have counted leaf-labeled phylogenetic networks in a variety of classes, finding that when the number of reticulations is fixed, the time-consistent galled trees are asymptotically less numerous than each of several network classes that had been previously examined. Here we provide enumerative results on two additional network classes: general galled trees and simplex time-consistent galled trees. We show that for a fixed number of galls, as the number of leaves goes to infinity, the asymptotic count of general galled trees is identical to that of time-consistent galled trees, whereas the count of simplex time-consistent galled trees is smaller. If the number of galls is not restricted, then the asymptotic approximations all differ: simplex time-consistent galled trees are less numerous than time-consistent galled trees, which are in turn less numerous than general galled trees. We also report a variety of additional results: recursions to count the studied networks with small numbers of leaves a fixed number of galls, as well as enumerative results for unlabeled networks in the classes that we investigate.</description>
