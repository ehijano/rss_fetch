      <title>Waveform Learning under Phase Noise Impairment for Sub-THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large untapped spectrum in sub-THz allows for ultra-high throughput communication to realize many seemingly impossible applications in 6G. Phase noise (PN) is one key hardware impairment, which is accentuated as we increase the frequency and bandwidth. Furthermore, the modest output power of the power amplifier demands limits on peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal design. In this work, we design a PN-robust, low PAPR single-carrier (SC) waveform by geometrically shaping the constellation and adapting the pulse shaping filter pair under practical PN modeling and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) constraints for a given excess bandwidth. We optimize the waveforms under conventional and state-of-the-art PN-aware demappers. Moreover, we introduce a neural-network (NN) demapper enhancing transceiver adaptability. We formulate the waveform optimization problem in its augmented Lagrangian form and use a back-propagation-inspired technique to obtain a design that is numerically robust to PN, while adhering to PAPR and ACLR constraints. The results substantiate the efficacy of the method, yielding up to 2.5 dB in the required Eb/N0 under stronger PN along with a PAPR reduction of 0.5 dB. Moreover, PAPR reductions up to 1.2 dB are possible with competitive BLER and SE performance in both low and high PN conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Coexistence of OTFS Modulation with OFDM-based Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coexistence of orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation with current fourth- and fifth-generation (4G/5G) communication systems that primarily use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. We first derive the input-output-relation of OTFS in the considered coexisting system. In this derivation, we consider (i) the inclusion of multiple cyclic prefixes (CPs) with unequal lengths to the OTFS signal and (ii) edge carrier unloading (ECU), to account for the impacts of CP length, frame structure, and subcarrier arrangement described in 3GPP standards for 4G/5G systems. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of multiple CPs to the OTFS signal and ECU lead to the channel response exhibiting spreading effects/leakage along the Doppler and delay dimensions, respectively. Consequently, the effective sampled delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel model for OTFS in coexisting systems may exhibit reduced sparsity. We also show that the effective DD domain channel coefficients for OTFS in coexisting systems are influenced by the unequal lengths of CPs. Subsequently, we propose an interference cancellation-based channel estimation (CE) technique for OTFS in coexisting systems. Through numerical results, we validate our analysis, highlight the importance of not ignoring the unequal lengths of CPs during signal detection, and show the significance of the proposed CE technique.</description>

      <title>CubeSat-Enabled Free-Space Optics: Joint Data Communication and Fine Beam Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of CubeSats with Free Space Optical (FSO) links accelerates a major advancement in high-throughput, low-Earth orbit communication systems. However, CubeSats face challenges such as size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations, as well as vibrations that cause fluctuations in the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the optical beam at the receiver. These practical challenges make establishing CubeSat-assisted FSO links complicated. To mitigate AoA fluctuations, we expand the receiver's field of view and track the location of the focused beam spot using an array of avalanche photodiodes at the receiver. Initially, we model the optical channel between the transmitter and the detector array. Furthermore, to reduce the computational load of maximum likelihood sequence detection, which is infeasible for CubeSats due to SWaP constraints, we propose a sub-optimal blind sequence data detection approach that relies on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) criterion. We also utilize combining methods such as equal gain combining (EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) for data detection, benchmarking their performance against the GLRT-based method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity GLRT-based method outperforms the combining methods, achieving performance close to that of the ideal receiver.</description>

      <title>Robust Low-Cost Drone Detection and Classification in Low SNR Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has raised significant safety concerns due to their potential misuse in activities such as espionage, smuggling, and infrastructure disruption. This paper addresses the critical need for effective drone detection and classification systems that operate independently of UAV cooperation. We evaluate various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their ability to detect and classify drones using spectrogram data derived from consecutive Fourier transforms of signal components. The focus is on model robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, which is critical for real-world applications. A comprehensive dataset is provided to support future model development. In addition, we demonstrate a low-cost drone detection system using a standard computer, software-defined radio (SDR) and antenna, validated through real-world field testing. On our development dataset, all models consistently achieved an average balanced classification accuracy of &gt;= 85% at SNR &gt; -12dB. In the field test, these models achieved an average balance accuracy of &gt; 80%, depending on transmitter distance and antenna direction. Our contributions include: a publicly available dataset for model development, a comparative analysis of CNN for drone detection under low SNR conditions, and the deployment and field evaluation of a practical, low-cost detection system.</description>

      <title>An open-source Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Acoustic Tracking, Bathymetric and Photogrammetric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) are becoming more affordable and include a wide variety of sensors and capacities with applications from ocean physics such as the Saildrone project to ecology with the tracking of marine species in the wild. Here, we present a multi-modal, affordable, open source, and reproducible ASV to track marine animal in shallow waters, collect information on bathymetry, and carry out photogrammetry surveys. The current specification enables scientists to track an animal equipped with an acoustic tag for 5~h and a spatial accuracy of 1~m. For bathymetric or photogrammetry surveys, the ASV can cover 100 x 100~m areas in 2~h with a distance of 1-m between transects. Depending on the sensors included in the ASV, it has a price ranging from \$2,434 to \$11,072. We illustrate these developments with a case study and a field survey for each of the different application proposed.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Interference Exploitation for DFRC Systems: A Block-Level Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. For high-precision radar sensing, we consider joint optimization of the correlation properties and spatial beam pattern. For communication, we employ constructive interference-based block-level precoding (CI-BLP) to leverage distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission on a block level. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose an improved majorizing function that leverages a novel diagonal matrix structure. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through a series of numerical experiments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance spatial/temporal sidelobe suppression through block-level optimization.</description>

      <title>Interference Cancellation Based Neural Receiver for Superimposed Pilot in Multi-Layer Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an interference cancellation based neural receiver for superimposed pilot (SIP) in multi-layer transmission is proposed, where the data and pilot are non-orthogonally superimposed in the same time-frequency resource. Specifically, to deal with the intra-layer and inter-layer interference of SIP under multi-layer transmission, the interference cancellation with superimposed symbol aided channel estimation is leveraged in the neural receiver, accompanied by the pre-design of pilot code-division orthogonal mechanism at transmitter. In addition, to address the complexity issue for inter-vendor collaboration and the generalization problem in practical deployments, respectively, this paper also provides a fixed SIP (F-SIP) design based on constant pilot power ratio and scalable mechanisms for different modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) and transmission layers. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes on the performance of block error rate and throughput compared with existing counterparts.</description>

      <title>Optimized Waveform Design for OFDM-based ISAC Systems Under Limited Resource Occupancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks introduces integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a technology in which communication and sensing functionalities are inextricably linked, sharing resources across time, frequency, space, and energy. Despite its popularity in communication, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, while advantageous for communication, has limitations in sensing performance within an ISAC network. This paper delves into OFDM waveform design through optimal resource allocation over time, frequency, and energy, maximizing sensing performance while preserving communication quality.
  During quasi-normal operation, the Base Station (BS) does not utilize all available time-frequency resources, resulting in high sidelobes in the OFDM waveform's ambiguity function, as well as decreased sensing accuracy. To address these latter issues, the paper proposes a novel interpolation technique using matrix completion through the Schatten p quasi-normal approximation, which requires fewer samples than the traditional nuclear norm for effective matrix completion and interpolation. This approach effectively suppresses the sidelobes, enhancing the sensing performance. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, such as standard complaint resource scheduling and interpolation, particularly in scenarios with limited resource occupancy.</description>

      <title>Scatterer Recognition from LiDAR Point Clouds for Environment-Embedded Vehicular Channel Modeling via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel environment-embedded vehicular channel model is proposed by scatterer recognition from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To provide a robust data foundation, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset in vehicular urban scenarios is constructed. Based on the constructed dataset, the complex SoM mechanism, i.e., mapping relationship between scatterers in electromagnetic space and LiDAR point clouds in physical environment, is explored via multilayer perceptron (MLP) with electromagnetic propagation mechanism. By using LiDAR point clouds to implement scatterer recognition, channel non-stationarity and consistency are modeled in an environment-embedded manner. Using ray-tracing (RT)-based results as the ground truth, the scatterer recognition accuracy exceeds 90%. The accuracy of the proposed model is further verified by the close fit between simulation results and RT results.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIMO Networks with Rotary ULAs for Indoor Scenarios under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fifth-Generation (5G) wireless communications networks introduced native support for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) use cases. Nevertheless, current 5G networks cannot fully meet the very stringent requirements regarding latency, reliability, and number of connected devices of most MTC use cases. Industry and academia have been working on the evolution from 5G to Sixth Generation (6G) networks. One of the main novelties is adopting Distributed Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (D-MIMO) networks. However, most works studying D-MIMO consider antenna arrays with no movement capabilities, even though some recent works have shown that this could bring substantial performance improvements. In this work, we propose the utilization of Access Points (APs) equipped with Rotary Uniform Linear Arrays (RULAs) for this purpose. Considering a spatially correlated Rician fading model, the optimal angular position of the RULAs is jointly computed by the central processing unit using particle swarm optimization as a function of the position of the active devices. Considering the impact of imperfect positioning estimates, our numerical results show that the RULAs's optimal rotation brings substantial performance gains in terms of mean per-user spectral efficiency. The improvement grows with the strength of the line-of-sight components of the channel vectors. Given the total number of antenna elements, we study the trade-off between the number of APs and the number of antenna elements per AP, revealing an optimal number of APs for the cases of APs equipped with static ULAs and RULAs.</description>

      <title>Fronthaul Quantization-Aware MU-MIMO Precoding for Sum Rate Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system where the precoding matrix is selected in a baseband unit (BBU) and then sent over a digital fronthaul to the transmitting antenna array. The fronthaul has a limited bit resolution with a known quantization behavior. We formulate a new sum rate maximization problem where the precoding matrix elements must comply with the quantizer. We solve this non-convex mixed-integer problem to local optimality by a novel iterative algorithm inspired by the classical weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach. The precoding optimization subproblem becomes an integer least-squares problem, which we solve with a new algorithm using a sphere decoding (SD) approach. We show numerically that the proposed precoding technique vastly outperforms the baseline of optimizing an infinite-resolution precoder and then quantizing it. We also develop a heuristic quantization-aware precoding that outperforms the baseline while having comparable complexity.</description>

      <title>Coordinated RSMA for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Emergency UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving robust and rapid emergency response capabilities. Such a novel framework offers high-quality and cost-efficient C\&amp;S services due to the intrinsic flexibility and mobility of UAVs. In parallel, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is able to achieve a tailor-made communication by splitting the messages into private and common parts with adjustable rates, making it suitable for on-demand data transmission in disaster scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coordinated RSMA for integrated sensing and communication (CoRSMA-ISAC) scheme in emergency UAV system to facilitate search and rescue operations, where a number of ISAC UAVs simultaneously communicate with multiple communication survivors (CSs) and detect a potentially trapped survivor (TS) in a coordinated manner. Towards this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system, subject to the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement. In order to solve the formulated non-convex problem, we first decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., UAV-CS association, UAV deployment, as well as beamforming optimization and rate allocation. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative optimization approach leveraging K-Means, successive convex approximation (SCA), and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithms to reframe the subproblems into a more tractable form and efficiently solve them. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CoRSMA-ISAC scheme is superior to conventional space division multiple access (SDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms of both communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>OTFS-NOMA System for MIMO Communication Networks with Spatial Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication network where mobile users (MUs) with different mobility profiles are grouped into clusters. We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users that have diverse mobility profiles. High-mobility (HM) users' signals are placed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain using OTFS modulation in order to transform their time-varying channel into a sparse static channel, while low-mobility (LM) users signals are placed in the time-frequency (TF) domain. Precoding is adopted at the BS to direct focused beams towards each cluster of users. Moreover, NOMA spectrum sharing is used in each cluster to allow the coexistence of a single HM user and multiple LM users within the same resource block. LM users access disjoint subchannels to ensure their orthogonality. All users within the same cluster first detect the HM user's signal. Afterward, LM users suppress the interference from the HM user and detect their own signals. Closed-form expressions of the detection signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are derived. The numerical results showed that the performance of the proposed system highly depends on the number of LM users, the number of clusters and the power allocation factors between HM and LM users.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable and Efficient Sleep Staging Algorithm: DetectsleepNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep quality directly impacts human health and quality of life, so accurate sleep staging is essential for assessing sleep quality. However, most traditional methods are inefficient and time-consuming due to segmenting different sleep cycles by manual labeling. In contrast, automated sleep staging technology not only directly assesses sleep quality but also helps sleep specialists analyze sleep status, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the cost of sleep monitoring, especially for continuous sleep monitoring. Most of the existing models, however, are deficient in computational efficiency, lightweight design, and model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture based on the prior knowledge of sleep experts. Specifically, 1) Propose an end-to-end model named DetectsleepNet that uses single-channel EEG signals without additional data processing, which has achieved an impressive 80.9% accuracy on the SHHS dataset and an outstanding 88.0% accuracy on the Physio2018 dataset. 2) Constructure an efficient lightweight sleep staging model named DetectsleepNet-tiny based on DetectsleepNet, which has just 6% of the parameter numbers of existing models, but its accuracy exceeds 99% of state-of-the-art models, 3) Introducing a specific inference header to assess the attention given to a specific EEG segment in each sleep frame, enhancing the transparency in the decisions of models. Our model comprises fewer parameters compared to existing ones and ulteriorly explores the interpretability of the model to facilitate its application in healthcare.

      <title>Joint Channel and Data Estimation for Multiuser Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) algorithm for uplink multiuser extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. The initial channel estimation is formulated as a sparse reconstruction problem based on the angle and distance sparsity under the near-field propagation condition. This problem is solved using non-orthogonal pilots through an efficient low complexity two-stage compressed sensing algorithm. Furthermore, the initial channel estimates are refined by employing a JCDE framework driven by both non-orthogonal pilots and estimated data. The JCDE problem is solved by sequential expectation propagation (EP) algorithms, where the channel and data are alternately updated in an iterative manner. In the channel estimation phase, integrating Bayesian inference with a model-based deterministic approach provides precise estimations to effectively exploit the near-field characteristics in the beam-domain. In the data estimation phase, a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based filter is designed at each sub-array to address the correlation due to energy leakage in the beam-domain arising from the near-field effects. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed initial channel estimation and JCDE algorithm outperforms the state-ofthe-art approaches in terms of channel estimation, data detection, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Empowered LiDAR Point Cloud Generation with Multimodal Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications is a key enabler for the 6G wireless communication systems. The multiple sensing modalities will allow the base station to have a more accurate representation of the environment, leading to context-aware communications. Some widely equipped sensors such as cameras and RADAR sensors can provide some environmental perceptions. However, they are not enough to generate precise environmental representations, especially in adverse weather conditions. On the other hand, the LiDAR sensors provide more accurate representations, however, their widespread adoption is hindered by their high cost. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the wireless communication systems by synthesizing LiDAR point clouds from images and RADAR data. Specifically, it uses a multimodal transformer architecture and pre-trained encoding models to enable an accurate LiDAR generation. The proposed framework is evaluated on the DeepSense 6G dataset, which is a real-world dataset curated for context-aware wireless applications. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately generating LiDAR point clouds. We achieve a modified mean squared error of 10.3931. Visual examination of the images indicates that our model can successfully capture the majority of structures present in the LiDAR point cloud for diverse environments. This will enable the base stations to achieve more precise environmental sensing. By integrating LiDAR synthesis with existing sensing modalities, our method can enhance the performance of various wireless applications, including beam and blockage prediction.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structured Sparsity in Near Field: From the Perspective of Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structured sparsity can be leveraged in traditional far-field channels, greatly facilitating efficient sparse channel recovery by compressing the complexity of overheads to the level of the scatterer number. However, when experiencing a fundamental shift from planar-wave-based far-field modeling to spherical-wave-based near-field modeling, whether these benefits persist in the near-field regime remains an open issue. To answer this question, this article delves into structured sparsity in the near-field realm, examining its peculiarities and challenges. In particular, we present the key features of near-field structured sparsity in contrast to the far-field counterpart, drawing from both physical and mathematical perspectives. Upon unmasking the theoretical bottlenecks, we resort to bypassing them by decoupling the geometric parameters of the scatterers, termed the triple parametric decomposition (TPD) framework. It is demonstrated that our novel TPD framework can achieve robust recovery of near-field sparse channels by applying the potential structured sparsity and avoiding the curse of complexity and overhead.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Consumption of Rotary Wing and Fixed Wing UAVs in Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used to enable wireless communications. Due to their characteristics, such as the ability to hover and carry cargo, UAVs can serve as communications nodes, including Wi-Fi Access Points and Cellular Base Stations. In previous work, we proposed the Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement (SUPPLY) algorithm, which focuses on the energy-efficient placement of multiple UAVs acting as Flying Access Points (FAPs). Additionally, we developed the Multi-UAV Energy Consumption (MUAVE) simulator to evaluate the UAV energy consumption, specifically when using the SUPPLY algorithm. However, MUAVE was initially designed to compute the energy consumption for rotary-wing UAVs only.
  In this paper, we propose eMUAVE, an enhanced version of the MUAVE simulator that allows the evaluation of the energy consumption for both rotary-wing and fixed-wing UAVs. Our energy consumption evaluation using eMUAVE considers reference and random networking scenarios. The results show that fixed-wing UAVs can be employed in the majority of networking scenarios. However, rotary-wing UAVs are typically more energy-efficient than fixed-wing UAVs when following the trajectories defined by SUPPLY.</description>

      <title>Spatial Multiplexing in Near-Field Line-of-Sight MIMO Communications: Paraxial and Non-Paraxial Deployments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to include aspects of energy footprint reduction (sustainability), besides those of network capacity and connectivity, at the design stage. This paradigm change requires radically new physical layer technologies. Notably, the integration of large-aperture arrays and the transmission over high frequency bands, such as the sub-terahertz spectrum, are two promising options. In many communication scenarios of practical interest, the use of large antenna arrays in the sub-terahertz frequency range often results in short-range transmission distances that are characterized by line-of-sight channels, in which pairs of transmitters and receivers are located in the (radiating) near field of one another. These features make the traditional designs, based on the far-field approximation, for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems sub-optimal in terms of spatial multiplexing gains. To overcome these limitations, new designs for MIMO systems are required, which account for the spherical wavefront that characterizes the electromagnetic waves in the near field, in order to ensure the highest spatial multiplexing gain without increasing the power expenditure. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework for optimizing the deployment of antenna arrays in line-of-sight channels, which can be applied to paraxial and non-paraxial network deployments. In the paraxial setting, we devise a simpler analytical framework, which, compared to those available in the literature, provides explicit information about the impact of key design parameters. In the non-paraxial setting, we introduce a novel analytical framework that allows us to identify a set of sufficient conditions to be fulfilled for achieving the highest spatial multiplexing gain. The proposed designs are validated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>ALMA: a mathematics-driven approach for determining tuning parameters in generalized LASSO problems, with applications to MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique employed for non-invasive in vivo visualization of internal structures. Sparsity is often deployed to accelerate the signal acquisition or overcome the presence of motion artifacts, improving the quality of image reconstruction. Image reconstruction algorithms use TV-regularized LASSO (Total Variation-regularized LASSO) to retrieve the missing information of undersampled signals, by cleaning the data of noise and while optimizing sparsity. A tuning parameter moderates the balance between these two aspects; its choice affecting the quality of the reconstructions. Currently, there is a lack of general deterministic techniques to choose these parameters, which are oftentimes manually selected and thus hinder the reliability of the reconstructions. Here, we present ALMA (Algorithm for Lagrange Multipliers Approximation), an iterative mathematics-inspired technique that computes tuning parameters for generalized LASSO problems during MRI reconstruction. We analyze quantitatively the performance of these parameters for imaging reconstructions via TV-LASSO in an MRI context on phantoms. Although our study concentrates on TV-LASSO, the techniques developed here hold significant promise for a wide array of applications. ALMA is not only adaptable to more generalized LASSO problems but is also robust to accommodate other forms of regularization beyond total variation. Moreover, it extends effectively to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, broadening its utility in complex data reconstruction scenarios. More generally, ALMA provides a powerful tool for numerically solving constrained optimization problems across various disciplines, offering a versatile and impactful solution for advanced computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS-Empowered Multiple Access: A Distributed Sum-Rate Maximization Approach</title>

Abstract: The plethora of wirelessly connected devices, whose deployment density is expected to largely increase in the upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks, will naturally necessitate substantial advances in multiple access schemes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute a candidate 6G technology capable to offer dynamic over-the-air signal propagation programmability, which can be optimized for efficient non-orthogonal access of a multitude of devices. In this paper, we study the downlink of a wideband communication system comprising multiple multi-antenna Base Stations (BSs), each wishing to serve an associated single-antenna user via the assistance of a Beyond Diagonal (BD) and frequency-selective RIS. Under the assumption that each BS performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions and exclusively controls a distinct RIS, we focus on the sum-rate maximization problem and present a distributed joint design of the linear precoders at the BSs as well as the tunable capacitances and the switch selection matrices at the multiple BD RISs. The formulated non-convex design optimization problem is solved via successive concave approximation necessitating minimal cooperation among the BSs. Our extensive simulation results showcase the performance superiority of the proposed cooperative scheme over non-cooperation benchmarks, indicating the performance gains with BD RISs via the presented optimized frequency selective operation for various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Control-Oriented Deep Space Communications For Unmanned Space Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unmanned space exploration, the cooperation among space robots requires advanced communication techniques. In this paper, we propose a communication optimization scheme for a specific cooperation system named the "mother-daughter system". In this setup, the mother spacecraft orbits the planet, while daughter probes are distributed across the planetary surface. During each control cycle, the mother spacecraft senses the environment, computes control commands and distributes them to daughter probes for actions. They synergistically form sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC^3}$) loops. Given the indivisibility of the $\mathbf{SC^3}$ loop, we optimize the mother-daughter downlink for closed-loop control. The optimization objective is the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost, and the optimization parameters are the block length and transmit power. To solve the nonlinear mixed-integer problem, we first identify the optimal block length and then transform the power allocation problem into a tractable convex problem. We further derive the approximate closed-form solutions for the proposed scheme and two communication-oriented schemes: the max-sum rate scheme and the max-min rate scheme. On this basis, we analyze their power allocation principles. In particular, for time-insensitive control tasks, we find that the proposed scheme demonstrates equivalence to the max-min rate scheme. These findings are verified through simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed and Unsupervised Riemannian Domain Adaptation for Machine Learning on Heterogeneous EEG Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for supervised machine learning (ML) is challenging due to session, subject, and device variability. ML algorithms typically require identical features at train and test time, complicating analysis due to varying sensor numbers and positions across datasets. Simple channel selection discards valuable data, leading to poorer performance, especially with datasets sharing few channels. To address this, we propose an unsupervised approach leveraging EEG signal physics. We map EEG channels to fixed positions using field interpolation, facilitating source-free domain adaptation. Leveraging Riemannian geometry classification pipelines and transfer learning steps, our method demonstrates robust performance in brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks and potential biomarker applications. Comparative analysis against a statistical-based approach known as Dimensionality Transcending, a signal-based imputation called ComImp, source-dependent methods, as well as common channel selection and spherical spline interpolation, was conducted with leave-one-dataset-out validation on six public BCI datasets for a right-hand/left-hand classification task. Numerical experiments show that in the presence of few shared channels in train and test, the field interpolation consistently outperforms other methods, demonstrating enhanced classification performance across all datasets. When more channels are shared, field interpolation was found to be competitive with other methods and faster to compute than source-dependent methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the positioning of the pilot symbols, as well as the power distribution between the pilot and the communication symbols in the OTFS modulation scheme. We analyze the pilot placements that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in estimating the channel taps. In addition, we optimize the average channel capacity by adjusting the power balance. We show that this leads to a significant increase in average capacity. The results provide valuable guidance for designing the OTFS parameters to achieve maximum capacity. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the findings.</description>

Abstract: Limitation of the cost of coordination and contention among a large number of nodes calls for grant-free approaches, exploiting physical layer techniques to solve collisions. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is becoming a key building block of multiple access channel receiver, in an effort to support massive Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we explore the large-scale performance of SIC in a theoretical framework. A general model of a SIC receiver is stated for a shared channel with $n$ transmitters. The asymptotic sum-rate performance is characterized as $n \rightarrow \infty$, for a suitably scaled target Signal to Noise Interference Ratio (SNIR). The probability distribution of the number of correctly decoded packets is shown to tend to a deterministic distribution asymptotically for large values of $n$. The asymptotic analysis is carried out for any probability distribution of the wireless channel gain, assuming that the average received power level is same for all nodes, through power control.</description>

Abstract: The detection of multiple extended targets in complex environments using high-resolution automotive radar is considered. A data-driven approach is proposed where unlabeled synchronized lidar data is used as ground truth to train a neural network with only radar data as input. To this end, the novel, large-scale, real-life, and multi-sensor RaDelft dataset has been recorded using a demonstrator vehicle in different locations in the city of Delft. The dataset, as well as the documentation and example code, is publicly available for those researchers in the field of automotive radar or machine perception. The proposed data-driven detector is able to generate lidar-like point clouds using only radar data from a high-resolution system, which preserves the shape and size of extended targets. The results are compared against conventional CFAR detectors as well as variations of the method to emulate the available approaches in the literature, using the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, and the Chamfer distance as performance metrics. Moreover, an ablation study was carried out to assess the impact of Doppler and temporal information on detection performance. The proposed method outperforms the different baselines in terms of Chamfer distance, achieving a reduction of 75% against conventional CFAR detectors and 10% against the modified state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurement From Wearable Biosignals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have captured significant interest from both academia and industry due to their impressive performance across various textual tasks. However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 $\pm$ 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 $\pm$ 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.</description>

Abstract: Noise: an enemy to be dealt with and a major factor limiting communication system performance. However, what if there is gold in that garbage? In conventional engineering, our focus is primarily on eliminating, suppressing, combating, or even ignoring noise and its detrimental impacts. Conversely, could we exploit it similarly to biology, which utilizes noise-alike carrier signals to convey information? In this context, the utilization of noise, or noise-alike signals in general, has been put forward as a means to realize unconditionally secure communication systems in the future. In this tutorial article, we begin by tracing the origins of thermal noise-based communication and highlighting one of its significant applications for ensuring unconditionally secure networks: the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange scheme. We then delve into the inherent challenges tied to secure communication and discuss the imperative need for physics-based key distribution schemes in pursuit of unconditional security. Concurrently, we provide a concise overview of quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes and draw comparisons with their KLJN-based counterparts. Finally, extending beyond wired communication loops, we explore the transmission of noise signals over-the-air and evaluate their potential for stealth and secure wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Radio Map-Based Spectrum Sharing for Joint Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02118</link>

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) network is expected to provide both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) services. However, spectrum scarcity poses a major challenge to the harmonious coexistence of C&amp;S systems. Without effective cooperation, the interference resulting from spectrum sharing impairs the performance of both systems. This paper addresses C&amp;S interference within a distributed network. Different from traditional schemes that require pilot-based high-frequency interactions between C&amp;S systems, we introduce a third party named the radio map to provide the large-scale channel state information (CSI). With large-scale CSI, we optimize the transmit power of C&amp;S systems to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the radar detection, while meeting the ergodic rate requirement of the interfered user. Given the non-convexity of both the objective and constraint, we employ the techniques of auxiliary-function-based scaling and fractional programming for simplification. Subsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results corroborate our idea that the extrinsic information, i.e., positions and surroundings, is effective to decouple C&amp;S interference.</description>

      <title>Refining Myocardial Infarction Detection: A Novel Multi-Modal Composite Kernel Strategy in One-Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of myocardial infarction (MI), a critical condition arising from coronary artery disease (CAD), is vital to prevent further myocardial damage. This study introduces a novel method for early MI detection using a one-class classification (OCC) algorithm in echocardiography. Our study overcomes the challenge of limited echocardiography data availability by adopting a novel approach based on Multi-modal Subspace Support Vector Data Description. The proposed technique involves a specialized MI detection framework employing multi-view echocardiography incorporating a composite kernel in the non-linear projection trick, fusing Gaussian and Laplacian sigmoid functions. Additionally, we enhance the update strategy of the projection matrices by adapting maximization for both or one of the modalities in the optimization process. Our method boosts MI detection capability by efficiently transforming features extracted from echocardiography data into an optimized lower-dimensional subspace. The OCC model trained specifically on target class instances from the comprehensive HMC-QU dataset that includes multiple echocardiography views indicates a marked improvement in MI detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that our proposed multi-view approach achieves a geometric mean of 71.24%, signifying a substantial advancement in echocardiography-based MI diagnosis and offering more precise and efficient diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Relay Assisted Communication Systems Through Antenna Location Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation for fluid antenna relay (FAR) system with antenna location optimization. In the considered model, each user transmits information to a base station (BS) with help of FAR. The antenna location of the FAR is flexible and can be adapted to dynamic location distribution of the users. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem through jointly optimizing the antenna location and bandwidth allocation with meeting the minimum rate requirements, total bandwidth budget, and feasible antenna region constraints. To solve this problem, we obtain the optimal bandwidth in closed form. Based on the optimal bandwidth, the original problem is reduced to the antenna location optimization problem and an alternating algorithm is proposed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the sum rate can be increased by up to 125% compared to the conventional schemes.</description>
