      <title>Extrapolation to infinite model space of no-core shell model calculations using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbar\Omega$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in the community for the Neutron Stars and what we can learn from them. In this review we show how chiral effective field theory, combined with many-body methods, can provide important results that connect Neutron Star properties at zero temperature to nuclear physics and allows to use these compact objects as laboratories of new physics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering Cross Sections at Medium Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak interactions of neutrinos with other Standard Model particles are well described within the Standard Model of particle physics. However, modern accelerator-based neutrino experiments employ nuclei as targets, where neutrinos interact with bound nucleons, turning a seemingly simple electroweak process into a complex many-body problem in nuclear physics. At the time of writing this Encyclopedia of Particle Physics chapter, neutrino-nucleus interactions remain one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in accelerator-based neutrino oscillation measurements.
  This chapter provides a pedagogical overview of neutrino interactions with nuclei in the medium-energy regime, spanning a few hundred MeV to several GeV. It introduces the fundamental electroweak formalism, outlines the dominant interaction mechanisms - including quasielastic scattering, resonance production, and deep inelastic scattering - and discusses how nuclear effects such as Fermi motion, nucleon-nucleon correlations, meson-exchange currents, and final-state interactions modify observable cross sections. The chapter also presents a brief survey of the foundational and most widely used theoretical models for neutrino-nucleus cross sections, together with an overview of current and upcoming accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments that are shaping the field.
  Rather than targeting experts, this chapter serves as a primer for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career researchers entering the field. It provides a concise foundation for understanding neutrino-nucleus scattering, its relevance to oscillation experiments, and its broader connections to both particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>The $Z\alpha^2$ correction to superallowed beta decays in effective field theory and implications for $|V_{ud}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superallowed ($0^+\rightarrow0^+$) beta decays currently provide the most precise extraction of quark mixing in the Standard Model. Their interpretation as a measurement of $|V_{ud}|$ relies on a reliable first-principles computation of QED radiative corrections expressed as a series in $Z\alpha$ and $\alpha$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent result for two-loop, $O(Z\alpha^2)$, long-distance radiative corrections where the nuclei are treated as heavy point-like particles.
  We use renormalization group analysis to obtain new results at $O(Z\alpha^3)$ for the coefficient of double-logarithms in the ratio of the maximal beta energy to the inverse nuclear size, $\Em/R^{-1}$. We use the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem to obtain new results at $O(Z^2\alpha^3)$ for the coefficient of logarithms in the ratio of maximal beta energy to the electron mass, $\log(2\Em/\me)$. We identify a structure-dependent, and therefore short-distance, contribution to the traditional $Z\alpha^2$ correction that should be revisited.. We provide the first comprehensive update to the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the impact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in the long-distance corrections are $2.5\times$ larger than past estimates of their uncertainty, $1.5\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the combined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated systematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed beta decays at $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate, with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.</description>

      <title>On the Inner Crusts of Neo-Neutron Stars: exotic light nuclei, diffusional and thermodynamical stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model, we investigate the properties of non-accreted crusts of young and warm neo-neutron stars, i.e., of finite-temperature inhomogeneous dense matter in beta equilibrium. An interesting feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust, of an extensive and almost pure layer of neutron-rich light nuclei that extends up to the density of the transition to homogeneous matter. Most probably, this layer emerges due to translational degrees of freedom of the nuclei. If confirmed, it will significantly impact the transport and elastic properties of the crust and its crystallization process. Then, we demonstrate that our inner crust is stable with respect to the diffusion of ions, which is in contrast with some of the predictions made in the literature for cold crusts. Finally, we show that clusterization completely exhausts the density instabilities that affect sub-saturated nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of ground-state correlations on the multipole response of nuclei: Ab initio calculations of moment operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework that allows to calculate integrated properties of the nuclear response from first principles. Using the ab initio in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), we calculate the expectation values of moment operators that are linked to the multipole response of nuclei. This approach is applied to the isoscalar mono- and quadrupole as well as the isovector dipole response of closed-shell nuclei from $^4$He to $^{78}$Ni for different chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions. We find that the inclusion of many-body correlations in the nuclear ground state significantly impacts the multipole response when going from the random-phase approximation to the IMSRG level. Our IMSRG calculations lead to an improved description of experimental data in $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca, including a good reproduction of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn enhancement factor. These findings highlight the utility of the moment method as a benchmark for other ab initio approaches that describe nuclear response functions through the explicit treatment of excited states.</description>

      <title>High-order cumulants and correlation functions near the critical point from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition using molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our prior studies to third- and fourth-order cumulants in both coordinate- and momentum-space acceptances and integrated correlation functions (factorial cumulants). We find that, even near the critical point, non-Gaussian cumulants equilibrate on time scales comparable to those of the second-order cumulants, but show stronger finite-size effects. The presence of interactions and of the critical point leads to strong deviations of the cumulants from the ideal-gas baseline in coordinate space; these deviations are expected to persist in momentum space in the presence of collective expansion. In particular, the kurtosis becomes strongly negative, $\kappa \sigma^2 \ll -1$, on the crossover side of the critical point. However, this signal is significantly diluted once an efficiency cut used to distinguish protons from baryons is applied, leading to $|\kappa \sigma^2| \lesssim 1$ even in the presence of the critical point. We discuss our results in the context of ongoing measurements of proton number cumulants in heavy-ion collisions in RHIC-BES-II.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of the $\phi$-$^{4}\mathrm{He}$ scattering length from near-threshold $\phi$ photoproduction on helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model-independent extraction of the phi-4He scattering length from near-threshold phi photoproduction on helium-4, based on LEPS Collaboration data for the coherent process gamma + 4He -&gt; phi + 4He and the Vector Meson Dominance framework. Assuming an energy-independent differential cross section, we extract the absolute value of the phi-4He scattering length |alpha_{phi4He}| = (3.33 +- 0.06) x 10^{-4} fm from a fit at threshold t_thr. This value is orders of magnitude smaller than those for phi-N and phi-d scattering lengths, indicating an inverse dependence of |alpha_VA| on the target nucleus mass. Our results provide new insight into the phi-nucleus interaction, supporting the notion of weak phi-nucleus coupling. We further explore the dependence of |alpha_VA| on the vector meson mass, the target atom mass, and the threshold energy. An approximate exponential suppression of |alpha_VA| is observed with increasing vector meson mass or target atom mass, indicating that heavier vector mesons or heavier target nuclei exhibit weaker couplings in vector meson-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nuclear Dynamics in First Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research. In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO) pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.</description>
