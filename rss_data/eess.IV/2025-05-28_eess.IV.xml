      <title>An Artificial Intelligence Model for Early Stage Breast Cancer Detection from Biopsy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of breast cancer types plays a critical role in guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents an artificial intelligence enabled tool designed to aid in the identification of breast cancer types using histopathological biopsy images. Traditionally additional tests have to be done on women who are detected with breast cancer to find out the types of cancer it is to give the necessary cure. Those tests are not only invasive but also delay the initiation of treatment and increase patient burden. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues as well as accurate subclassification of breast cancer types. By preprocessing the images to reduce noise and enhance features, the model achieves reliable levels of classification performance. Experimental results on such datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, outperforming several existing solutions in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study emphasizes the potential of deep learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and offers a promising tool to assist pathologists in breast cancer classification.</description>

      <title>DiffNMR: Advancing Inpainting of Randomly Sampled Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy leverages nuclear magnetization to probe molecules' chemical environment, structure, and dynamics, with applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to the petroleum industry. Despite its utility, the high cost of NMR instrumentation, operation and the lengthy duration of experiments necessitate the development of computational techniques to optimize acquisition times. Non-Uniform sampling (NUS) is widely employed as a sub-sampling method to address these challenges, but it often introduces artifacts and degrades spectral quality, offsetting the benefits of reduced acquisition times. In this work, we propose the use of deep learning techniques to enhance the reconstruction quality of NUS spectra. Specifically, we explore the application of diffusion models, a relatively untapped approach in this domain. Our methodology involves applying diffusion models to both time-time and time-frequency NUS data, yielding satisfactory reconstructions of challenging spectra from the benchmark Artina dataset. This approach demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to improve the efficiency and accuracy of NMR spectroscopy as well as the superiority of using a time-frequency domain data over the time-time one, opening new landscapes for future studies.</description>

      <title>A Feasibility Study of Task-Based fMRI at 0.55 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 0.55T MRI offers advantages compared to conventional field strengths, including reduced susceptibility artifacts and better compatibility with simultaneous EEG recordings. However, reliable task-based fMRI at 0.55T has not been significantly demonstrated. In this study, we establish a robust task-based fMRI protocol and analysis pipeline at 0.55T that achieves full brain coverage and results comparable to what is expected for activation extent and location. We attempted fMRI at 0.55T by combining EPI acquisition with custom analysis techniques. Finger-tapping and visual tasks were used, comparing 5- and 10-minute runs to enhance activation detection. The results show significant activations, demonstrating that high-quality task-based fMRI is achievable at 0.55T in single subjects. This study demonstrates that reliable task-based fMRI is feasible on 0.55T scanners, potentially broadening functional neuroimaging access in clinical and research settings where high-field MRI is unavailable or impractical, supporting broader diagnostic and research applications.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation for Segmentation and Signal Unmixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Ui2i, a novel model for unpaired image-to-image translation, trained on content-wise unpaired datasets to enable style transfer across domains while preserving content. Building on CycleGAN, Ui2i incorporates key modifications to better disentangle content and style features, and preserve content integrity. Specifically, Ui2i employs U-Net-based generators with skip connections to propagate localized shallow features deep into the generator. Ui2i removes feature-based normalization layers from all modules and replaces them with approximate bidirectional spectral normalization -- a parameter-based alternative that enhances training stability. To further support content preservation, channel and spatial attention mechanisms are integrated into the generators. Training is facilitated through image scale augmentation. Evaluation on two biomedical tasks -- domain adaptation for nuclear segmentation in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images and unmixing of biological structures superimposed in single-channel immunofluorescence (IF) images -- demonstrates Ui2i's ability to preserve content fidelity in settings that demand more accurate structural preservation than typical translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Ui2i is the first approach capable of separating superimposed signals in IF images using real, unpaired training data.</description>

      <title>The Role of AI in Early Detection of Life-Threatening Diseases: A Retinal Imaging Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal imaging has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive modality for detecting and quantifying biomarkers of systemic diseases-ranging from diabetes and hypertension to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disorders but current insights remain dispersed across platforms and specialties. Recent technological advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT/OCTA) and adaptive optics (AO) now deliver ultra-high-resolution scans (down to 5 {\mu}m ) with superior contrast and spatial integration, allowing early identification of microvascular abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes. At the same time, AI-driven and machine learning (ML) algorithms have revolutionized the analysis of large-scale retinal datasets, increasing sensitivity and specificity; for example, deep learning models achieve &gt; 90 \% sensitivity for diabetic retinopathy and AUC = 0.89 for the prediction of cardiovascular risk from fundus photographs. The proliferation of mobile health technologies and telemedicine platforms further extends access, reduces costs, and facilitates community-based screening and longitudinal monitoring. Despite these breakthroughs, translation into routine practice is hindered by heterogeneous imaging protocols, limited external validation of AI models, and integration challenges within clinical workflows. In this review, we systematically synthesize the latest OCT/OCT and AO developments, AI/ML approaches, and mHealth/Tele-ophthalmology initiatives and quantify their diagnostic performance across disease domains. Finally, we propose a roadmap for multicenter protocol standardization, prospective validation trials, and seamless incorporation of retinal screening into primary and specialty care pathways-paving the way for precision prevention, early intervention, and ongoing treatment of life-threatening systemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Multitemporal Latent Dynamical Framework for Hyperspectral Images Unmixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing can capture dynamical evolution of materials. Despite its capability, current methods emphasize variability of endmembers while neglecting dynamics of abundances, which motivates our adoption of neural ordinary differential equations to model abundances temporally. However, this motivation is hindered by two challenges: the inherent complexity in defining, modeling and solving problem, and the absence of theoretical support. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose a multitemporal latent dynamical (MiLD) unmixing framework by capturing dynamical evolution of materials with theoretical validation. For addressing multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, MiLD consists of problem definition, mathematical modeling, solution algorithm and theoretical support. We formulate multitemporal unmixing problem definition by conducting ordinary differential equations and developing latent variables. We transfer multitemporal unmixing to mathematical model by dynamical discretization approaches, which describe the discreteness of observed sequence images with mathematical expansions. We propose algorithm to solve problem and capture dynamics of materials, which approximates abundance evolution by neural networks. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support by validating the crucial properties, which verifies consistency, convergence and stability theorems. The major contributions of MiLD include defining problem by ordinary differential equations, modeling problem by dynamical discretization approach, solving problem by multitemporal unmixing algorithm, and presenting theoretical support. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have validated the utility of our work</description>

      <title>Generative Image Compression by Estimating Gradients of the Rate-variable Feature Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While learned image compression (LIC) focuses on efficient data transmission, generative image compression (GIC) extends this framework by integrating generative modeling to produce photo-realistic reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and no-reference quality assessments.</description>

      <title>Cardiac Digital Twins at Scale from MRI: Open Tools and Representative Models from ~55000 UK Biobank Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning of cardiovascular diseases. This requires an anatomically accurate patient-specific 3D structural representation of the heart, suitable for electro-mechanical simulations or study of disease mechanisms. However, generation of cardiac digital twins at scale is demanding and there are no public repositories of models across demographic groups. We describe an automatic open-source pipeline for creating patient-specific left and right ventricular meshes from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images, its application to a large cohort of ~55000 participants from UK Biobank, and the construction of the most comprehensive cohort of adult heart models to date, comprising 1423 representative meshes across sex (male, female), body mass index (range: 16 - 42 kg/m$^2$) and age (range: 49 - 80 years). Our code is available at https://github.com/cdttk/biv-volumetric-meshing/tree/plos2025 , and pre-trained networks, representative volumetric meshes with fibers and UVCs will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>Prostate Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Micro-Ultrasound: A Comparative Study with Traditional Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel imaging modality with diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening methods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with csPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to extract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers were trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice level. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive slices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a classifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and limitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved AUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US model achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical model showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include a retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation. Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves specificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method may reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to PSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze prostate micro-ultrasound images. It outperformed PSA and DRE in detecting aggressive cancer and may help avoid unnecessary biopsies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a global disease, infertility has always affected human beings. The development of assisted reproductive technology can effectively solve this disease. However, the traditional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer technology still faces many challenges in improving the success rate of pregnancy, such as the subjectivity of embryo grading and the inefficiency of integrating multi-modal data. Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence-based technologies is particularly crucial. This article reviews the application progress of multi-modal artificial intelligence in embryo grading and pregnancy prediction based on different data modalities (including static images, time-lapse videos and structured table data) from a new perspective, and discusses the main challenges in current research, such as the complexity of multi-modal information fusion and data scarcity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.Deep learning-based methods are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods.We create a SAR image dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence method.The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep learning.Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a wider range and more accurate elevation measurements compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>DeepConvContext: A Multi-Scale Approach to Timeseries Classification in Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows. Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/context_har.</description>

      <title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via High-Frequency Augmentation and Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a significant challenge in the security of machine learning models, particularly in the context of black-box defense strategies. Existing methods for enhancing adversarial transferability primarily focus on the spatial domain. This paper presents Frequency-Space Attack (FSA), a new adversarial attack framework that effectively integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain transformations. FSA combines two key techniques: (1) High-Frequency Augmentation, which applies Fourier transform with frequency-selective amplification to diversify inputs and emphasize the critical role of high-frequency components in adversarial attacks, and (2) Hierarchical-Gradient Fusion, which merges multi-scale gradient decomposition and fusion to capture both global structures and fine-grained details, resulting in smoother perturbations. Our experiment demonstrates that FSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various black-box models. Notably, our proposed FSA achieves an average attack success rate increase of 23.6% compared with BSR (CVPR 2024) on eight black-box defense models.</description>

      <title>DiMoSR: Feature Modulation via Multi-Branch Dilated Convolutions for Efficient Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing reconstruction quality versus model efficiency remains a critical challenge in lightweight single image super-resolution (SISR). Despite the prevalence of attention mechanisms in recent state-of-the-art SISR approaches that primarily emphasize or suppress feature maps, alternative architectural paradigms warrant further exploration. This paper introduces DiMoSR (Dilated Modulation Super-Resolution), a novel architecture that enhances feature representation through modulation to complement attention in lightweight SISR networks. The proposed approach leverages multi-branch dilated convolutions to capture rich contextual information over a wider receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DiMoSR outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods across diverse benchmark datasets, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM metrics with comparable or reduced computational complexity. Through comprehensive ablation studies, this work not only validates the effectiveness of DiMoSR but also provides critical insights into the interplay between attention mechanisms and feature modulation to guide future research in efficient network design.

      <title>Supervised and self-supervised land-cover segmentation &amp; classification of the Biesbosch wetlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate wetland land-cover classification is essential for environmental monitoring, biodiversity assessment, and sustainable ecosystem management. However, the scarcity of annotated data, especially for high-resolution satellite imagery, poses a significant challenge for supervised learning approaches. To tackle this issue, this study presents a methodology for wetland land-cover segmentation and classification that adopts both supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL). We train a U-Net model from scratch on Sentinel-2 imagery across six wetland regions in the Netherlands, achieving a baseline model accuracy of 85.26%.
  Addressing the limited availability of labeled data, the results show that SSL pretraining with an autoencoder can improve accuracy, especially for the high-resolution imagery where it is more difficult to obtain labeled data, reaching an accuracy of 88.23%.
  Furthermore, we introduce a framework to scale manually annotated high-resolution labels to medium-resolution inputs. While the quantitative performance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides significantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.
  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with Dynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Efficient Leaf Disease Classification and Segmentation using Midpoint Normalization Technique and Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing plant disease detection from leaf imagery remains a persistent challenge due to scarce labeled data and complex contextual factors. We introduce a transformative two-stage methodology, Mid Point Normalization (MPN) for intelligent image preprocessing, coupled with sophisticated attention mechanisms that dynamically recalibrate feature representations. Our classification pipeline, merging MPN with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, achieves remarkable 93% accuracy while maintaining exceptional class-wise balance. The perfect F1 score attained for our target class exemplifies attention's power in adaptive feature refinement. For segmentation tasks, we seamlessly integrate identical attention blocks within U-Net architecture using MPN-enhanced inputs, delivering compelling performance gains with 72.44% Dice score and 58.54% IoU, substantially outperforming baseline implementations. Beyond superior accuracy metrics, our approach yields computationally efficient, lightweight architectures perfectly suited for real-world computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Out-of-distribution Detection for Sparse-view Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and ``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.</description>

      <title>UltraBones100k: A reliable automated labeling method and large-scale dataset for ultrasound-based bone surface extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed.
  We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score.
  We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p &lt; 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).</description>

      <title>HWA-UNETR: Hierarchical Window Aggregate UNETR for 3D Multimodal Gastric Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via https://github.com/JeMing-creater/HWA-UNETR.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Diffusion Models for Hyperspectral Image Processing and Analysis: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image processing and analysis has important application value in remote sensing, agriculture and environmental monitoring, but its high dimensionality, data redundancy and noise interference etc. bring great challenges to the analysis. Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Single Snapshot Distillation for Phase Coded Mask Design in Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) reconstructs phase information from magnitude measurements, known as coded diffraction patterns (CDPs), whose quality depends on the number of snapshots captured using coded phase masks. High-quality phase estimation requires multiple snapshots, which is not desired for efficient PR systems. End-to-end frameworks enable joint optimization of the optical system and the recovery neural network. However, their application is constrained by physical implementation limitations. Additionally, the framework is prone to gradient vanishing issues related to its global optimization process. This paper introduces a Knowledge Distillation (KD) optimization approach to address these limitations. KD transfers knowledge from a larger, lower-constrained network (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient, and implementable network (student). In this method, the teacher, a PR system trained with multiple snapshots, distills its knowledge into a single-snapshot PR system, the student. The loss functions compare the CPMs and the feature space of the recovery network. Simulations demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction performance compared to a PR system trained without the teacher's guidance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Computational Feasibility of Direct Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix for MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework.
  While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition and block-wise inversion leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse \textit{in vivo} datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a practical and adaptable reconstruction method that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.</description>

      <title>Structure-Accurate Medical Image Translation via Dynamic Frequency Balance and Knowledge Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal medical images play a crucial role in the precise and comprehensive clinical diagnosis. Diffusion model is a powerful strategy to synthesize the required medical images. However, existing approaches still suffer from the problem of anatomical structure distortion due to the overfitting of high-frequency information and the weakening of low-frequency information. Thus, we propose a novel method based on dynamic frequency balance and knowledge guidance. Specifically, we first extract the low-frequency and high-frequency components by decomposing the critical features of the model using wavelet transform. Then, a dynamic frequency balance module is designed to adaptively adjust frequency for enhancing global low-frequency features and effective high-frequency details as well as suppressing high-frequency noise. To further overcome the challenges posed by the large differences between different medical modalities, we construct a knowledge-guided mechanism that fuses the prior clinical knowledge from a visual language model with visual features, to facilitate the generation of accurate anatomical structures. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed method achieves significant improvements in qualitative and quantitative assessments, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>Efficient LiDAR Reflectance Compression via Scanning Serialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance. SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis. Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22% reduction of compressed bits while using only 2% of its parameters. Moreover, a lightweight version of SerLiC achieves &gt; 10 fps (frames per second) with just 111K parameters, which is attractive for real-world applications.</description>
