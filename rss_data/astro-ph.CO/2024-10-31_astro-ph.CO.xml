      <title>Cosmology and Astrophysics with the Diffuse eRASS1 X-ray Angular Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent tension in the value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_M/0.3)^{1/2}$, which represents the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations of the universe, has not been resolved. In this work, we present constraints on $S_8$ with the X-ray angular power spectra of clusters and groups measured with the half-sky map from the eROSITA All Sky Survey data release 1 (eRASS1). Thanks to the extensive sky coverage of eRASS1, its power spectrum achieves unprecedented precision compared to previous measurements. Using a well-calibrated, physical halo gas model that includes astrophysics of feedback and non-thermal pressure support, we obtain $S_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ with 1$\sigma$ uncertainty that is competitive against other cosmological probes. Our derived $S_8$ value is smaller than the primary CMB measurements from Planck, but still consistent to within $1\sigma$. We also obtain constraints on the astrophysics of feedback, non-thermal pressure, equation of state in cluster cores, and gas boundaries in clusters and groups. We discuss how additional X-ray observations, and cosmological surveys in microwave and optical, will further improve the cosmological constraints with the angular power spectrum. Our work demonstrates that the angular power spectrum of clusters and groups is a promising probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Early Dark Energy Effects on the 21cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dark energy (EDE) is one of the leading models proposed to resolve the perplexing Hubble tension. Despite extensive scrutiny and testing against various observables, conclusive constraints remain elusive as we await new data. In this paper, we study the impact of EDE on the 21cm signal, a powerful probe of cosmic dawn, and the epoch of reionization. First, we examine the signatures of the shift in cosmological parameters and the new EDE parameters on the evolution of the 21cm signal compared to $\Lambda$CDM. We then focus on the implications of these signatures for upcoming radio interferometer telescopes, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), and their ability to differentiate between EDE and $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we forecast HERA's sensitivity to the fractional energy density of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, assuming a fiducial EDE model. We find significant modifications to the 21cm signal due to the presence of EDE. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that HERA, operating in its designed configuration, is poised to differentiate between the models and be sensitive to $f_{\rm EDE}$ within $2\sigma$ after $\mathcal{O}(100)$ days of observation and $5\sigma$ after 2 years.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters as cosmic clocks: new cosmological hints from their integrated light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the reliability and robustness in measuring the age, metallicity and mass of a sample of old Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) from their integrated light, setting the stage for using GCs as cosmic clocks at high redshift. We analyse 77 GCs from the WAGGS project, first by measuring Lick indices and spectroscopic breaks with PyLick, then performing full-spectral-fitting (FSF) with BAGPIPES. The analysis of Lick indices offers an estimate of the GCs' age and [Z/H], generally aligning with literature values, but highlights a subset of old GCs for which we estimate younger ages. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of blue horizontal branches (HB), which are not accounted for in the stellar population models. With FSF we measure the GCs' ages, [Z/H], and masses, also testing the cosmological prior's impact on ages. Compared to isochrone fitting estimates, ages are best recovered when the cosmological prior is removed, with a 20% increase in GCs' ages compatible with literature values (within $\pm$1.5 Gyr). The derived [Z/H] and mass agree with the reference values, regardless of HB morphology or fit setting, with average discrepancies across the entire sample of $\Delta$[Z/H]=-0.02$\pm$0.24 dex and $\Delta log(M/M_{\odot})=0.04\pm 0.28$ dex. Ages are best recovered for metal-rich GCs ([Z/H]$\geq$-0.4) showing a red HB (HBR&gt;0), with 70% of the results compatible with literature values. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we identify a tail of 24 old GCs with age=13.4$\pm$1.1 Gyr. Being a natural lower limit to the age of the Universe, we use this value to constrain $H_0$, obtaining $H_0 = 70.5^{+7.7}_{-6.3}$ km/s/Mpc (stat+syst) when a flat $\Lambda$CDM with $\Omega_m =0.30 \pm 0.02$ is assumed. Validating the study of GCs based on integrated light lays the foundation to extend this type of study to high-z, where lensed GCs have begun to appear, thanks to JWST. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., whose speed of sound at the rest frame is different from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch and imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <title>The Excess of JWST Bright Galaxies: a Possible Origin in the Ground State of Dynamical Dark Energy in the light of DESI 2024 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ${\Lambda}$ CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range $10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15$ needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ${\Omega}_{\Lambda}$=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range $15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$.</description>

      <title>Further support for $S_8$ increasing with effective redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: angular galaxy clustering from deep surveys with complex selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line of sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe thanks to the large number density and extensive depth of the data. However, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys will potentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF from the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\sigma$ magnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves an excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We find that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing, introduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude. To correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to recover an ``organised random'' (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as the galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering of galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover complicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We validate this ``SOM+HC'' method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic systematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter constraints, removing the $27\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that is recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real KiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC configuration near the optimal setup suggested by the mock tests. Our software is open-source for future usage.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18884v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole (Shamir 2024). We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the ad-hoc statistic employed by Shamir (2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we motivate the fact that couplings between a scalar field and the Standard Model with strengths $10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity yield the total measured cosmological dark matter abundance over a broad mass range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{14}\ \rm{eV}$. Remarkably, this result holds with minimal sensitivity to whether the scalar couples to electrons, photons, hadrons, or other particles at laboratory energy scales, thereby linking fifth force experiments to the search for dark matter.</description>

      <title>ERGO-ML: A continuous organization of the X-ray galaxy cluster population in TNG-Cluster with contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\leq z&lt;1$, resulting in a dataset of $\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology on Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With physical quantum computers becoming increasingly accessible, research on their applications across various fields has advanced rapidly. In this paper, we present the first study of quantum cosmology conducted on physical quantum computers, employing a newly proposed Hybrid Quantum-Classical (HQC) algorithm rather than the commonly used Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Specifically, we solve a constrained Hamiltonian equation derived by quantizing the Friedmann equation in cosmology. To solve this constraint equation, H |psi&gt; = 0, where H is a Hamiltonian operator and |psi&gt; = |psi(theta)&gt; is the wave function of phase angle theta describing the cosmic quantum state, we iteratively use the quantum computer to compute the eigenvalues of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt;, while a classical computer manages the underlying probability density function within the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm (PBA) to update theta until the solution of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt; = 0 is achieved to a desired accuracy. Executing our algorithm on IBM's quantum computers, we attain a high-precision solution for theta, achieving approximately 1 percent error.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electroweak Phase Transition with a Real Scalar Singlet at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is essential for explaining baryogenesis and for potentially generating observable gravitational waves. This study investigates the potential of a high-energy muon collider to examine the occurrence of SFOEWPT within the context of a Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet (xSM). We analyzed all possible decay modes of the singlet to constrain the valid parameter space of SFOEWPT, which was extracted numerically at different renormalization scales to account for theoretical uncertainties, thereby determining the sensitivity of a muon collider to the production and decay channels of novel heavy scalar particles that emerge in the xSM. The findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV muon collider can directly examine the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking by efficiently detecting novel scalar particles associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition through jet-rich final states, thus complementing the indirect constraints from gravitational wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: The C-19 star stream has the abundance characteristics of an unusually metal poor globular cluster but kinematically is uncharacteristically hot and wide for a cluster stream, having a line of sight velocity dispersion of 6 \kms\ and a 1-sigma width of 240 pc. We show that the tidal dissolution of an old, lower mass, globular cluster in a CDM galactic halo naturally creates a hot, wide stream currently near orbital apocenter. More generally, simulations show that hot streams, which are all near their orbital apocenter, become thin, cool streams near pericenter. Furthermore, the wide streams from a population of dissolved clusters in the simulations have a mean galactocentric radial velocity dispersion of 7.8$\pm$1.0 \kms\ in a CDM cosmology but only 4.1$\pm$1.6 \kms\ in a WDM (5.5 keV) simulation. A detailed C-19 model in a simplified Milky Way halo potential with a CDM subhalo population provides a lower bound to stream heating, finding that the stream develops a line of sight velocity dispersion of 4.1$\pm$1.1 \kms, whereas WDM (5.5 keV) subhalos give 3.1$\pm$0.1\kms. Known dwarf galaxies alone provide negligible heating. There are five other currently known streams wider than 200 pc that contain a globular cluster, all near their orbital apocenter.</description>

      <title>Unexplored regions in teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity: Sign-changing dark energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity has shown considerable potential in addressing cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ discrepancies, we explore previously overlooked solution spaces within this framework that hold further promise. Specifically, we examine the case where the customary assumption of a strictly positive effective dark energy (DE) density -- natural in general relativity -- may not apply, offering new possibilities. Focusing on the exponential infrared model $f(T)=Te^{\beta T_0/T}$, where $T$ is the torsion scalar, we investigate cosmological solutions characterized by the constant $\beta$, which is controlled by the present-day matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. Ensuring consistency with CMB data, we find that the widely studied $\beta_{+}$ (positive exponent) case exhibits phantom behavior, while the previously overlooked $\beta_{-}$ (negative exponent) case -- sufficient to avoid instabilities or ghosts -- features a sign-changing DE density that transitions smoothly from negative to positive values at redshift $z_{\dagger} \sim 1.5$, consistent with recent approaches to alleviating cosmological tensions. Though the sign-changing DE density in the $f(T)$ model leads to a larger-than-expected enhancement, we further extend the analysis by incorporating a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. This extension, $f(T) \rightarrow f(T) + 2\Lambda$, broadens the solution space consistent with the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement while maintaining consistency with CMB power spectra. Additionally, it introduces richer phenomenological possibilities, including the potential moderation or cessation of cosmic acceleration at very low redshifts, aligning with recent observational analyses, such as those from DESI BAO data. Our findings also suggest that existing $f(T)$ cosmological models should be revisited in light of the novel theoretical insights presented here.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use modern dimensionally-reduced effective field theory methods, with careful attention to scale hierarchies, to analyze and catalog the types of first-order electroweak phase transitions that are possible in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our calculations lay the necessary groundwork to perform gauge invariant, properly resummed perturbative expansions, and therefore address many of the theoretical problems with phase transition calculations. We find three types of configurations of the scalar potential that allow for a first-order phase transition, namely tree-level barriers, radiative barriers, or radiative symmetry breaking through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We also find versions of these with significant supercooling. We perform a global likelihood scan over the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators involving only the Higgs field, to identify parameter regions that exhibit these first-order phase transitions and are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints. We comment on the possibilities for electroweak baryogenesis within the SMEFT, and roughly estimate if the gravitational wave spectra generated by the phase transitions are detectable.</description>

Abstract: In the regime of cosmology and large-scale structure formation, filaments are vital components of the cosmic web. This study employs statistical methods to examine the formation, evolution, and cosmological constraints of filaments identified by DisPerSe. We run large-sample of N-body simulations to study the filament length and its evolution. In general, the filament length distribution can be fitted by a power law with both the normalization and power index dependent on redshift and cosmological parameters. It is discovered that filament length distribution is influenced by various cosmological parameters, with $\sigma_8$ and $n_s$ exhibiting slightly stronger dependence than $\Omega_m$. We also uncover a three-stage filament formation process from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 1$: rapid formation of both long and short filaments from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 2$, persistence of long filaments from $z \sim 2$ to $z \sim 1$, followed by fragmentation and increased prevalence of shorter filaments below $z \sim 1$. Finally, we employ initial power spectrum fluctuations to elucidate the cosmological dependence on the filament length function. These insights enhance our understanding of filament evolution and their cosmological relevance and also highlight the potential cosmological applications in observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of Supernova Ia (SNIa) distance moduli $\mu(z)$ and dark energy using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reconstruction based on LSST simulated three-year SNIa data. The ANNs employed in this study utilize genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning and Monte Carlo Dropout for predictions. Our ANN reconstruction architecture is capable of modeling both the distance moduli and their associated statistical errors given redshift values. We compare the performance of the ANN-based reconstruction with two theoretical dark energy models: $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CPL). Bayesian analysis is conducted for these theoretical models using the LSST simulations and compared with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We demonstrate that our model-independent ANN reconstruction is consistent with both theoretical models. Performance metrics and statistical tests reveal that the ANN produces distance modulus estimates that align well with the LSST dataset and exhibit only minor discrepancies with $\Lambda$CDM and CPL.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Matter Power Spectrum Modeling in Interacting Dark Energy Cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5\%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model's robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter $\xi$ will be constrained to $\sigma(\xi) = 0.0110$. This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Galaxy Clustering Constraints With Cross-Bin Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering studies in current photometric galaxy surveys focus solely on auto-correlations, neglecting cross-correlations between redshift bins. We evaluate the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating cross-bin correlations in Fisher forecasts for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Our analysis considers the impact of including redshift space distortions (RSD) and magnification in model predictions, as well as systematic uncertainties in photometric redshift distributions (photo-$z$). While auto-correlations alone suffer from a degeneracy between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) and galaxy bias parameters, accounting for RSD and magnification in cross-correlations helps break this degeneracy - although more weakly than the degeneracy breaking expected from a combined analysis with other observables. Incorporating cross-bin correlations does not significantly increase sensitivity to photo-$z$ systematics, addressing previous concerns, and self-calibrates photo-$z$ systematics, reducing errors on photo-$z$ nuisance parameters. We suggest that the benefits of including cross-correlations in future photometric galaxy clustering analyses outweigh the risks, but caution that careful evaluation is necessary as more realistic pictures of surveys' precision and systematic error budgets develop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard approach to test for deviations from general relativity on cosmological scales is to combine measurements of the growth rate of structure with gravitational lensing. In this study, we show that this method suffers from an important limitation with regard to these two probes: models of dark matter with additional interactions can lead to the very same observational signatures found in modified gravity and vice versa. Using synthetic data of redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is inevitable between modifications of gravity and a dark fifth force. We then show that the coming generation of surveys, in particular the Square Kilometre Array, will allow us to break the degeneracy between such models through measurements of gravitational redshift. Performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the synthetic dataset, we quantify the extent to which gravitational redshift can distinguish between two representative classes of models, generalized Brans-Dicke (modified gravity) and coupled quintessence (fifth force).</description>

      <title>Power spectrum multipoles and clustering wedges during the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the viability of using power spectrum clustering wedges as summary statistics of 21cm surveys during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). For observations in a wide redshift range $z\sim 7-9$ corresponding to a line-of-sight scale of $\sim 500$Mpc, the power spectrum is subject to anisotropic effects due to the evolution along the light-of-sight. Information on the physics of reionization can be extracted from the anisotropy using the power spectrum multipoles. Signals of the power spectrum monopole are highly correlated at scales smaller than the typical ionization bubble, which can be disentangled by including higher-order multipoles. By simulating observations of the low frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory, we find that the sampling of the cylindrical wavenumber $k$-space is highly non-uniform due to the baseline distribution, i.e. the distribution of antenna pairs sampling different transverse ${k}_\perp$ scales. Measurements in clustering wedges partition the cylindrical $k$-space into different radial $k_\parallel$ scales, and can be used for isolating parts of $k$-space with relatively uniform sampling, allowing for more precise parameter inference. Using Fisher Matrix forecasts, we find that the reionization model can be inferred with per-cent level precision with $\sim 120$hrs of integration time using SKA-Low. Compared to model inference using only the power spectrum monopole above the foreground wedge, model inference using multipole power spectra in clustering wedges yields a factor of $\sim 3$ improvement on the marginalised 1D parameter constraints.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmology, but it is affected by the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxy shapes with the large-scale structure. Upcoming surveys like Euclid and Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require an accurate understanding of IA, particularly for higher-order cosmic shear statistics that are vital for extracting the most cosmological information. In this paper, we report the first detection of third-order IA correlations using the LOWZ galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We compare our measurements with predictions from the MICE cosmological simulation and an analytical NLA-inspired model informed by second-order correlations. We also explore the dependence of the third-order correlation on the galaxies' luminosity. We find that the amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}$ of the IA signal is non-zero at the $4.7\sigma$ ($7.6\sigma$) level for scales between $6 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ ($1 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$) and $20 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$. For scales above $6 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ the inferred AIA agrees both with the prediction from the simulation and estimates from second-order statistics within $1\sigma$ but deviations arise at smaller scales. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of measuring third-order IA correlations and using them for constraining IA models. The agreement between second- and third-order IA constraints also opens the opportunity for a consistent joint analysis and IA self-calibration, promising tighter parameter constraints for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Background (CB) is defined as the isotropic diffuse radiation field with extragalactic origin found across the electromagnetic spectrum. Different astrophysical sources dominate the CB emission at different energies, such as stars in the optical or active galactic nuclei in x rays. Assuming that dark matter consists of axions or axionlike particles with masses on the order of electron volts or higher, we expect an additional contribution to the CB due to their decay into two photons. Here, we model the CB between the optical and x ray regimes, and include the contribution of decaying axions. Through a comparison with the most recent direct and indirect CB measurements, we constrain the axion parameter space between masses $0.5\, \mathrm{eV}\, - 10^7\,\mathrm{eV}$ and improve previous limits on axion-photon coupling derived from the CB by roughly an order of magnitude, also reaching the QCD band. We further study the contribution of axions decaying in the Milky Way halo and characterize the axion parameters that would explain the tentative excess CB emission observed with the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager instrument on-board the New Horizons probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that scalar field dark matter halos would contain solitonic cores -- spherically symmetric ground state configurations -- at their centers. This is especially interesting in the case of ultralight dark matter (ULDM), where the solitons sizes are on the order of galaxies. In this work, we show that the paradigm of a spherically symmetric soliton embedded in the center of each halo is not universally valid in a scenario with multiple interacting scalar fields. In particular, sufficiently strong repulsive interspecies interactions make the fields immiscible. In such models, the ground state configuration can fall into a number of different phases that depend on the fields' relative densities, masses, and interaction strengths. This raises the possibility that the inner regions of ULDM halos are more complex and diverse than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmology dependence of baryonic feedback in weak lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust modeling of non-linear scales is critical for accurate cosmological inference in Stage IV surveys. For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach. Our results show that the PCA method is robust to the coupling between cosmology and baryonic feedback, whereas, when using HMCode2020 there can be up to $0.5\sigma$ bias in $\Omega_\text{m}$-$S_8$. For HMCode2020, the bias also correlates with the input cosmology while for PCA we find no such correlation.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the D &lt; 120 Mpc Local Universe</title>

Abstract: The Local Universe (D &lt; 120 Mpc) has been intensely studied for decades, with highly complete galaxy redshift surveys now publicly available. These data have driven density reconstructions of the underlying matter density field, as well as constrained simulations that aim to reproduce the observed structures. In this paper, we introduce a dispersion measure (DM) model that makes use of this detailed knowledge of our Local Universe within D &lt; 120 Mpc. The model comprises three key components: (i) the DM from the Milky Way halo and the intra-group medium (up to 3.4 Mpc), derived from the HESTIA simulations, a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce our Local Group; (ii) the DM contribution from the large-scale intergalactic medium beyond the Local Group (3.4 Mpc &lt; D &lt; 120 Mpc), calculated using the HAMLET reconstructed matter density field; and (iii) the individual DM contributions from Local Universe galaxy halos and clusters based on data from the 2MASS Galaxy Group Catalog and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. This comprehensive model will be made available as a Python package. As the most realistic model to date for DM in the local volume, it promises to improve the constraints of DM contributions from the Intergalactic Medium and Circumgalactic Medium of FRBs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cosmic baryon distribution calculations based on DM analysis of FRBs.</description>

      <title>White Paper on Light Sterile Neutrino Searches and Related Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This white paper provides a comprehensive review of our present understanding of experimental neutrino anomalies that remain unresolved, charting the progress achieved over the last decade at the experimental and phenomenological level, and sets the stage for future programmatic prospects in addressing those anomalies. It is purposed to serve as a guiding and motivational "encyclopedic" reference, with emphasis on needs and options for future exploration that may lead to the ultimate resolution of the anomalies. We see the main experimental, analysis, and theory-driven thrusts that will be essential to achieving this goal being: 1) Cover all anomaly sectors -- given the unresolved nature of all four canonical anomalies, it is imperative to support all pillars of a diverse experimental portfolio, source, reactor, decay-at-rest, decay-in-flight, and other methods/sources, to provide complementary probes of and increased precision for new physics explanations; 2) Pursue diverse signatures -- it is imperative that experiments make design and analysis choices that maximize sensitivity to as broad an array of these potential new physics signatures as possible; 3) Deepen theoretical engagement -- priority in the theory community should be placed on development of standard and beyond standard models relevant to all four short-baseline anomalies and the development of tools for efficient tests of these models with existing and future experimental datasets; 4) Openly share data -- Fluid communication between the experimental and theory communities will be required, which implies that both experimental data releases and theoretical calculations should be publicly available; and 5) Apply robust analysis techniques -- Appropriate statistical treatment is crucial to assess the compatibility of data sets within the context of any given model.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Particle Production from Bubble Dynamics at a First Order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions (FOPTs) constitute an active area of contemporary research as a promising cosmological source of observable gravitational waves. The spacetime dynamics of the background scalar field undergoing the phase transition can also directly produce quanta of particles that couple to the scalar, which has not been studied as extensively in the literature. This paper provides the first careful examination of various aspects of this phenomenon, which is important for understanding the dynamics of the phase transition, the generation of gravitational waves, and various high energy and beyond the Standard Model phenomena. In particular, the contributions from various stages of FOPTs (bubble nucleation, expansion, collision, post-collision) are disentangled, and conceptual aspects of the associated underlying physics relevant for particle production are clarified. Subtleties related to non-universality of particle interactions and masses in different vacua are discussed, and the suppression of nonperturbative effects such as tachyonic instability and parametric resonance due to the inhomogeneous nature of the process is examined.</description>

      <title>$N_{\rm eff}$ as a new physics probe in the precision era of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a global fit to the electroweak vertices and 4-fermion operators of the standard model effective field theory in this work using $N_{\rm eff}$ from cosmological probes, as well as data sets from colliders and low-energy experiments. We find $N_{\rm eff}$, both its current measurement and future projections, can only marginally improve the fit in both the flavor universal and the most general flavor scenarios. The resulting $1\sigma$ bound on $N_{\rm eff}$ is significantly improved from the global fit and becomes comparable to its current theoretical uncertainty, such that the latter will become important for this study at next generation experiments like future lepton colliders. $N_{\rm eff}$ from the global fit is also adopted to predict the primordial helium abundance $Y_P$, which significantly reduces the parameter space on the $Y_P$-$N_{\rm eff}$ plane. Through error propagation, we also conclude that reducing the experimental uncertainty of $Y_P$ from metal-poor galaxies down below 0.2% could play an important role in deepening our understanding on the free neutron lifetime anomaly.</description>

      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for a conservative sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>
