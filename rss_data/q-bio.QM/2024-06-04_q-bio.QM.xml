      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Gaussian Process Emulation for a 1D Hemodynamics Model of CTEPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microvascular disease is a contributor to persistent pulmonary hypertension in those with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The heterogenous nature of the micro and macrovascular defects motivates the use of personalized computational models, which can predict flow dynamics within multiple generations of the arterial tree and into the microvasculature. Our study uses computational hemodynamics models and Gaussian processes for rapid, subject-specific calibration using retrospective data from a large animal model of CTEPH. Our subject-specific predictions shed light on microvascular dysfunction and arterial wall shear stress changes in CTEPH.</description>

      <title>QuST: QuPath Extension for Integrative Whole Slide Image and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, various technologies have been introduced into digital pathology, including artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods, in both areas of pathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis. AI-driven WSI analysis utilizes the power of deep learning (DL), expands the field of view for histopathological image analysis. On the other hand, ST bridges the gap between tissue spatial analysis and biological signals, offering the possibility to understand the spatial biology. However, a major bottleneck in DL-based WSI analysis is the preparation of training patterns, as hematoxylin \&amp; eosin (H\&amp;E) staining does not provide direct biological evidence, such as gene expression, for determining the category of a biological component. On the other hand, as of now, the resolution in ST is far beyond that of WSI, resulting the challenge of further spatial analysis. Although various WSI analysis tools, including QuPath, have cited the use of WSI analysis tools in the context of ST analysis, its usage is primarily focused on initial image analysis, with other tools being utilized for more detailed transcriptomic analysis. As a result, the information hidden beneath WSI has not yet been fully utilized to support ST analysis.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce QuST, a QuPath extension designed to bridge the gap between H\&amp;E WSI and ST analyzing tasks. In this paper, we highlight the importance of integrating DL-based WSI analysis and ST analysis in understanding disease biology and the challenges in integrating these modalities due to differences in data formats and analytical methods. The QuST source code is hosted on GitHub and documentation is available at https://github.com/huangch/qust.</description>

      <title>Equivariant amortized inference of poses for cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-EM is a vital technique for determining 3D structure of biological molecules such as proteins and viruses. The cryo-EM reconstruction problem is challenging due to the high noise levels, the missing poses of particles, and the computational demands of processing large datasets. A promising solution to these challenges lies in the use of amortized inference methods, which have shown particular efficacy in pose estimation for large datasets. However, these methods also encounter convergence issues, often necessitating sophisticated initialization strategies or engineered solutions for effective convergence. Building upon the existing cryoAI pipeline, which employs a symmetric loss function to address convergence problems, this work explores the emergence and persistence of these issues within the pipeline. Additionally, we explore the impact of equivariant amortized inference on enhancing convergence. Our investigations reveal that, when applied to simulated data, a pipeline incorporating an equivariant encoder not only converges faster and more frequently than the standard approach but also demonstrates superior performance in terms of pose estimation accuracy and the resolution of the reconstructed volume. Notably, $D_4$-equivariant encoders make the symmetric loss superfluous and, therefore, allow for a more efficient reconstruction pipeline.</description>

      <title>COVID-19: post infection implications in different age groups, mechanism, diagnosis, effective prevention, treatment, and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2, the highly contagious pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has persistent effects that begin four weeks after initial infection and last for an undetermined duration. These chronic effects are more harmful than acute ones. This review explores the long-term impact of the virus on various human organs, including the pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological, reproductive, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and lymphoid systems, particularly in older adults. Regarding diagnosis, RT-PCR is the gold standard for detecting COVID-19, though it requires specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and considerable time to produce results. To address these limitations, artificial intelligence in imaging and microfluidics technologies offers promising alternatives for diagnosing COVID-19 efficiently. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are effective in mitigating the persistent impacts of COVID-19. These strategies enhance immunity in post-COVID-19 patients by reducing cytokine release syndrome, improving T cell response, and increasing the circulation of activated natural killer and CD8 T cells in blood and tissues. This, in turn, alleviates symptoms such as fever, nausea, fatigue, muscle weakness, and pain. Vaccines, including inactivated viral, live attenuated viral, protein subunit, viral vectored, mRNA, DNA, and nanoparticle vaccines, significantly reduce the adverse long-term effects of the virus. However, no vaccine has been reported to provide lifetime protection against COVID-19. Consequently, protective measures such as physical distancing, mask usage, and hand hygiene remain essential strategies. This review offers a comprehensive understanding of the persistent effects of COVID-19 on individuals of varying ages, along with insights into diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and future preventative measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>An application of node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality to a protein complex hypernetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of graph centrality measures applied to biological networks, such as protein interaction networks, underpins much research into identifying key players within biological processes. This approach however is restricted to dyadic interactions and it is well-known that in many instances interactions are polyadic. In this study we illustrate the merit of using hypergraph centrality applied to a hypernetwork as an alternative. Specifically, we review and propose an extension to a recently introduced node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality model which provides mutually dependent node and edge centralities. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein complex hypernetwork is used as an example application with nodes representing proteins and hyperedges representing protein complexes. The resulting rankings of the nodes and edges are considered to see if they provide insight into the essentiality of the proteins and complexes. We find that certain variations of the model predict essentiality more accurately and that the degree-based variation illustrates that the centrality-lethality rule extends to a hypergraph setting. In particular, through exploitation of the models flexibility, we identify small sets of proteins densely populated with essential proteins.</description>

      <title>Matrix dissimilarities based on differences in moments and sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating a dissimilarity matrix is typically the first step in big data analysis. Although numerous methods exist, such as Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Manhattan distance, Bray Curtis dissimilarity, Jaccard similarity and Dice dissimilarity, it remains unclear which factors drive dissimilarity between groups. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on differences in moments and sparsity. We show that this method can delineate the key factors underlying group differences. For example, in biology, mean dissimilarity indicates differences driven by up down regulated gene expressions, standard deviation dissimilarity reflects the heterogeneity of response to treatment, and sparsity dissimilarity corresponds to differences prompted by the activation silence of genes. Through extensive reanalysis of genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, immune profiling, microbiome, and social science datasets, we demonstrate insights not captured in previous studies. For instance, it shows that the sparsity dissimilarity is as effective as the mean dissimilarity in predicting the alleviation effects of a COVID 19 drug, suggesting that sparsity dissimilarity is highly meaningful.</description>

      <title>Sifting through the Noise: A Survey of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Their Applications to Biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have made their way into a number of high-profile applications since their inception. In particular, there has been a wave of research into using diffusion models in the prediction and design of biomolecular structures and sequences. Their growing ubiquity makes it imperative for researchers in these fields to understand them. This paper serves as a general overview for the theory behind these models and the current state of research. We first introduce diffusion models and discuss common motifs used when applying them to biomolecules. We then present the significant outcomes achieved through the application of these models in generative and predictive tasks. This survey aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the increasingly critical role of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Distributional bias compromises leave-one-out cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-validation is a common method for estimating the predictive performance of machine learning models. In a data-scarce regime, where one typically wishes to maximize the number of instances used for training the model, an approach called "leave-one-out cross-validation" is often used. In this design, a separate model is built for predicting each data instance after training on all other instances. Since this results in a single test data point available per model trained, predictions are aggregated across the entire dataset to calculate common rank-based performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic or precision-recall curves. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach creates a negative correlation between the average label of each training fold and the label of its corresponding test instance, a phenomenon that we term distributional bias. As machine learning models tend to regress to the mean of their training data, this distributional bias tends to negatively impact performance evaluation and hyperparameter optimization. We show that this effect generalizes to leave-P-out cross-validation and persists across a wide range of modeling and evaluation approaches, and that it can lead to a bias against stronger regularization. To address this, we propose a generalizable rebalanced cross-validation approach that corrects for distributional bias. We demonstrate that our approach improves cross-validation performance evaluation in synthetic simulations and in several published leave-one-out analyses.</description>

      <title>An efficient solution to Hidden Markov Models on trees with coupled branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data, where the underlying states evolve in a stochastic manner and are only indirectly observable. Traditional HMM approaches are well-established for linear sequences, and have been extended to other structures such as trees. In this paper, we extend the framework of HMMs on trees to address scenarios where the tree-like structure of the data includes coupled branches -- a common feature in biological systems where entities within the same lineage exhibit dependent characteristics. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference. This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of HMMs on trees but also provides a practical tool for analyzing complex biological data where dependencies between branches cannot be ignored.</description>
