      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect in isotropic k-cubed Rashba model: Berry-curvature-dipole engineering by in-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear and nonlinear Hall effects in 2D systems are considered theoretically within the isotropic k-cubed Rashba model. We show that the presence of an out-of-plane external magnetic field or net magnetization is a necessary condition to induce a nonzero Berry curvature in the system, whereas an in-plane magnetic field tunes the Berry curvature leading to the Berry curvature dipole. Interestingly, in the linear response regime, the conductivity is dominated by the intrinsic component (Berry curvature component), whereas the second-order correction to the Hall current (i.e., the conductivity proportional to the external electric field) is dominated by the component independent of the Berry curvature dipole.</description>

      <title>Origin of pinning disorder in magnetic-field-induced Wigner solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low Landau level filling factors ($\nu$), Wigner solid phases of two-dimensional electron systems in GaAs are pinned by disorder, and exhibit a pinning mode, whose frequency is a measure of the disorder that pins the Wigner solid. Despite numerous studies spanning the last three decades, the origin of the disorder that causes the pinning and determines the pinning mode frequency remains unknown. Here we present a study of the pinning mode resonance in the low-$\nu$ Wigner solid phases of a series of ultralow-disorder GaAs quantum wells which are similar except for their varying well widths, $d$. The pinning mode frequencies,$f_p$, decrease strongly as $d$ increases, with the widest well exhibiting $f_p$ as low as $\simeq$35 MHz. The amount of reduction of \fp\ with increasing $d$ can be explained remarkably well by tails of the wave function impinging into the alloy-disordered Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As barriers that contain the electrons. However, it is imperative that the model for the confinement and wave function includes the Coulomb repulsion in the growth direction between the electrons as they occupy the quantum well.</description>

      <title>Mode-resolved micromagnetics study of parametric spin wave excitation in thin-film disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the parametric excitation of spin waves in thin film disks with a mode-resolved approach. The method involves projecting out the time-dependent magnetization, computed using micromagnetics simulations, onto the spatial profile of the eigenmodes that are obtained from the linearization of the equations of motion. Unlike spectral analysis in the frequency domain, the projection allows for the analysis of transient mode dynamics under parametric excitation. We apply this method to parallel pumping of quantized spin wave modes in in-plane magnetized thin-film disks, where phenomena like frequency pulling, mutual phase locking, and higher-order magnon scattering processes are identified.</description>

      <title>Delocalized low-frequency magnetoplasmon in a two-dimensional electron fluid with cylindrical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional (2D) electron system can be drastically altered by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the 2D plane. In particular, the frequency of its bulk collective excitations becomes gaped at the cyclotron frequency, while the low-frequency localized excitations, the edge magnetoplasmon (EMP), appear near the system's edge. A new type of the delocalized low-frequency excitations, the gradient magnetoplasmon (GMP), was recently shown to exist in a 2D electron system with a linear density gradient that breaks the system's cylindrical symmetry [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{103}, 075420 (2021)]. Like EMP, these new excitations are gapless and chiral, and originate from the classical Hall effect. Here we show that a similar magnetoplasmon mode can exist in a system with strongly-inhomogeneous radial distribution of the electron density that preserves the cylindrical symmetry. This is experimentally demonstrated in a pristine system of surface electrons on liquid helium and is confirmed by a numerical simulation. This result extends the variety of known collective excitations in a 2D charge system and presents electrons on helium as a promising model system for their study.</description>

      <title>Higher order spin interactions mediated by the substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the seminal works in the fifties it has been known that a bath of non-interacting electrons mediates an interaction between local moments (such as nuclear spins or magnetic impurities) coupled to distant sites of the lattice. Recent efforts in simultaneous control of multi-qubit arrays relies on defining quantum dots in environments which likewise contain electrons capable of mediating effective interactions. It is therefore interesting to analyze systems with more than two impurities in higher orders of perturbation theory. Here we derive and discuss the significance of the effective spin interactions between four impurities in fourth order of the coupling between the impurities and the substrate, mediated by conduction electrons of a two-dimensional square lattice. This effective interaction resembles the ring exchange - a coupling of four spins appearing in perturbative treatment of the Hubbard model. Despite it being a higher-order effect, it can dramatically influence the magnetic ordering. We show that as an effective interaction between impurity spins, the ring exchange can also compete with the more familiar two-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the mean-field model of a one-dimensional topological superconductor with two orbitals per unit cell. Time-reversal symmetry is absent, but a nonsymmorphic symmetry, involving a translation by a fraction of the unit cell, mimics the role of time-reversal symmetry. As a result, the topological superconductor has $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, two which support Majorana bound states and two which do not, in agreement with a prediction based on K-theory classification [K. Shiozaki et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 195413 (2016)]. As with the Kitaev chain, the presence of Majorana bound states gives rise to the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. The K-theory classification describes two $\mathbb{Z}_4$ subclasses, but, by identifying models in both subclasses, we show that they are related by a unitary transformation and are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Preservation of scalar spin chirality across a metallic spacer in synthetic antiferromagnets with chiral interlayer interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures are highly attractive for the development of spintronic devices, due to their properties to store and transport information in an energy efficient manner. In multilayered systems, these are typically stabilized via the interfacial intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which leads to configurations with both vector and scalar spin chirality. Additionally, it has been recently observed that DMI may also promote interlayer vector spin chirality, coupling spins in different magnetic layers via non-magnetic spacer layers, an effect referred to as interlayer DMI (IL-DMI).
  Here, we present evidence of the preservation of interlayer scalar spin chirality across the non-magnetic metallic spacer of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) with orthogonal anisotropy axes and IL-DMI. We draw this conclusion from a combined comprehensive experimental and computational study using scattering and imaging X-ray techniques. We find a direct relationship between the sign of the net out-of plane orientation of one of the layers, and the preferential in-plane vector spin chirality in the other layer after its demagnetization. Current IL-DMI models and other mechanisms which could potentially yield such chiral configurations fail in explaining these experimental results. This work thus uncovers a new flavor of chiral interlayer interactions, demanding the further development of theoretical models in order to describe the microscopic origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>A twist for nonlocal thermoelectricity in quantum wires as a signature of Bogoliubov-Fermi points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlocal thermoelectricity in a superconducting wire subject to spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field with a relative orientation $\theta$ between them. We calculate the current flowing in a normal probe attached to the bulk of a superconducting wire, as a result of a temperature difference applied at the ends of the wire. We find that the thermoelectric response occurs in ranges of the angles $\theta$ which correspond to the emergence of Bogoliubov-Fermi points in the energy spectrum of the superconducting wire.</description>

      <title>Quantization of optical quasinormal modes for spatially separated cavity systems with finite retardation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes (QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell calculations.</description>

      <title>Orbital and spin bilinear magnetotransport effect in Weyl/Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the bilinear current, scaling as $j\sim EB$, in two- and three-dimensional systems. Based on the extended semiclassical theory, we develop a unified theory including both longitudinal and transverse currents. We classify all contributions according to their different scaling relations with the relaxation time. We reveal the distinct contributions to the ordinary Hall effect, planar Hall effect, and magnetoresistance. We further report an intrinsic ordinary Hall current, which has a geometric origin and has not been discussed previously. Our theory is explicitly applied to studying a massive Dirac model and a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system. Our work presents a general theory of electric transport under a magnetic field, potentially laying the groundwork for future experimental studies or device fabrications.</description>

      <title>Magnetostatic bounds on stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional localized topological solitons in the volume of a magnet. In this work, starting with a classical free energy density of a helimagnet, an approximate variational model of hopfions is studied. The hopfion stability regions on the uniaxial anisotropy-external magnetic field phase diagram are computed and their evolution with increasing magnetostatic interaction strength is considered. It is found that magnetostatic interaction destabilizes the hopfions and, above the certain strength (relative to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), destroys their stability completely. Numerical estimates for this bound are provided. They can help focus the search for materials, supporting bulk magnetic hopfions.</description>

      <title>Topological Heavy Fermion Principle For Flat (Narrow) Bands With Concentrated Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general principle for the low-energy theory of narrow bands with concentrated Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric in the form of a map to Anderson-"+" models composed of heavy fermions hybridizing and interacting with semi-metallic modes. This map resolves the obstruction preventing topological bands from being realized in a local Hamiltonian acting on the low-energy degrees of freedom. The concentrated quantum geometry is reproduced through band inversion with a dispersive semi-metal, leaving a nearly flat, trivial band which becomes the heavy fermion. This representation is natural when the narrow band is not energetically isolated on the scale of the interaction and an enlarged Hilbert space is inescapable, but also provides analytical insight into the projected-interaction limit. First exemplified in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we extend it to (1) the twisted checkerboard, which we find has a chiral symmetric stable anomaly that forbids a lattice realization at all energies, and (2) the Lieb lattice with gapless flat bands, where we show the heavy fermions can be obtained by minimizing a Euclidean instanton action to saturate its BPS bound. The heavy fermion approach is widely applicable and physically transparent: heavy electrons carry the strong correlations and dispersive electrons carry the topology. This simple picture unifies the dichotomous phenomena observed in TBG and points to connections between moir\'e and stoichiometric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials engineered to host topological states of matter in controllable quantum systems hold promise for the advancement of quantum simulations and quantum computing technologies. In this context, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has gained prominence due to its simplicity and practical applications. Here, we present the implementation of a gate-tunable, five-unit-cell bosonic SSH chain on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting resonators. We achieve electrostatic control over the inductive intra-cell coupling using semiconductor nanowire junctions, which enables the spectroscopic observation of a transition from a trivial to a topological phase in the engineered metamaterial. In contrast to prior work, our approach offers precise and independent in-situ tuning of the coupling parameters. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the topological edge state against various disorder realizations. Our results supplement efforts towards gate-controlled superconducting electronics and large controllable bosonic lattices to enable quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>The photoinduced hidden metallic phase of monoclinic VO2 driven by local nucleation via a self-amplification process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide (VO2) has garnered extensive attention for its potential applications in ultrafast switches, neuronal network architectures, and storage technologies. However, a significant controversy persists regarding the formation of the IMT, specifically concerning whether a complete structural phase transition from monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) phase is necessary. Here we employ the real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to track the dynamic evolution of atomic and electronic structures in photoexcited VO2, revealing the emergence of a long-lived monoclinic metal phase (MM) under low electronic excitation. The emergence of the metal phase in the monoclinic structure originates from the dissociation of the local V-V dimer, driven by the self-trapped and self-amplified dynamics of photoexcited holes, rather than by a pure electron-electron correction. On the other hand, the M1-to-R phase transition does appear at higher electronic excitation. Our findings validate the existence of MM phase and provide a comprehensive picture of the IMT in photoexcited VO2.</description>

      <title>Counting statistics of ultra-broadband microwave photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency: bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white", broadband photons. Our setup allows for the detection of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the measured time-dependent voltage. After validating our procedure with thermal- and squeezed- radiation of such photons, we relate the detected statistics to the squeezing spectrum of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction. We observe an optimal squeezing of $\sim$1.5dB over a bandwidth $&gt;1$ GHz, better than 1dB over 3.5 GHz and still see squeezing over a bandwidth of $\sim6$ GHz around 6 GHz. We also show how the waveform of a bichromatic photon can be optimized for maximum squeezing.</description>

Abstract: The long-lived and optically addressable high-spin state of the negatively charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide makes it a promising system for applications in quantum technologies. Most studies of its spin dynamics have been performed in external magnetic fields applied along the symmetry axis. Here, we find that the application of weak magnetic fields perpendicular to the symmetry axis leads to nontrivial behavior caused by dynamical reorientation of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ spin multipole under optical excitation. Particularly, we observe the inversion of the quadrupole spin polarization in the excited state and appearance of the dipole spin polarization in the ground state. The latter is much higher than thermal polarization and cannot be induced solely by optical excitation. Our theoretical calculations reproduce well all sharp features in the spin resonance spectra, and shine light on the complex dynamics of spin multipoles in these kinds of solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling measurement induced phase transitions with tunable detector coupling</title>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Spin-Energy Entanglement of a Time-Focused Neutron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in thermoelectric materials of SnSSe and SnS$_2$: a non-equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulation of Boltzmann transport equation</title>

Abstract: In the present work, thermal transport and energy conversation in two thermoelectrically efficient candidates of Janus SnSSe and SnS$_2$ are investigated within the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of phonon Boltzmann equation. The phonon analysis is performed to determine the contributed phonons in heat transport. The results present that the dominant participating phonons are longitudinal acoustic ones while the least belongs to the transverse acoustic (TA) mode. Both materials reached the very high maximum temperature in response to the implied wasted heat. This is attributed to the low presence of the critical TA phonons. Also, the temperature profile achieved during the heating and cooling of the materials is studied. It is obtained that the heat propagation through the SnS$_2$ is, at first, swifter, which results in a temperature gradient through the whole material which is less than that of the SnSSe. As the time passes, the heat transfer that is directly related to the material thermal conductivity, slows down. So, the behavior of the SnS$_2$ and SnSSe, in case of the heat propagation status, becomes similar. More, the behavior of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), the efficiency ($\eta$), and the generated voltage have been figured out. It is stated that the higher zT and $\eta$ do not guarantee a larger generated Seebeck voltage. This is true, while the generated Seebeck voltage is related to the temperature difference between the heated and the cold junction. Accordingly, how far the temperature of matter rises in response to the implied wasted heat is related to the obtained voltage. Mainly, it is presented that the maximum temperature that a material achieves, alongside the temperature gradient and material property Seebeck coefficient, are essential in introducing thermoelectrically efficient materials with reasonable thermal to electrical energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Hybrid moir\'e excitons and trions in twisted MoTe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers</title>

Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical studies of MoTe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers with rigid moir\'e superlattices controlled by the twist angle. Using an effective continuum model that combines resonant interlayer electron tunneling with stacking-dependent moir\'e potentials, we identify the nature of moir\'e excitons and the dependence of their energies, oscillator strengths and Land\'e $g$-factors on the twist angle. Within the same framework, we interpret distinct signatures of bound complexes among electrons and moir\'e excitons in nearly collinear heterostacks. Our work provides fundamental understanding of hybrid moir\'e excitons and trions in MoTe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, and establishes the material system as a prime candidate for optical studies of correlated phenomena in moir\'e lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Spin-Transfer and Spin-Pumping in Collinear Antiferromagnets and Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates as active components in spintronic applications. They share features with ferrimagnets in that opposing spin orientations exist in two or more sublattices. Spin transfer torque and spin pumping are essential ingredients in antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnet spintronics. This paper develops an out-of-equilibrium quantum theory of the spin dynamics of collinear magnets containing many spins coupled to normal metal reservoirs. At equilibrium, the spins are parallel or antiparallel to the easy axis. The theory, therefore, covers collinear antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets. We focus on the resulting semi-classical spin dynamics. The dissipation in the spin dynamics is enhanced due to spin-pumping. Spin accumulations in the normal metals induce deterministic spin-transfer torques on the magnet. Additionally, each electron's discrete spin angular momentum causes stochastic fluctuating torques on the antiferromagnet or ferrimagnet. We derive these fluctuating torques. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds at high temperatures, including the effects of spin-pumping. At low temperatures, we derive shot noise contributions to the fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry and superconducting domes in (111) oxide interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and discuss some of the implications for the $\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. From a tight-binding modeling of the interface, we derive a two-band low-energy model, allowing us to analytically compute the quantum geometry and giving us access to the superfluid weight, as well as to showcase the role of two particular relevant energy scales. One is given by the trigonal crystal field which stems from the local trigonal symmetry at the interface, and the other one is due to orbital mixing at the interface. Our calculations indicate that the variation of the superfluid weight with the chemical potential $\mu$ is controlled by the quantum geometry in the low-$\mu$ limit where it presents a dome. At higher values of $\mu$ the conventional contribution dominates. In order to make quantitative comparisons between our results and experimental findings, we rely on an experimentally observed global reduction of the superfluid weight that we apply to both the conventional and geometric contributions. Furthermore, an experimentally measured non-monotonic variation of $\mu$ with the gate voltage $V_g$ is taken into account and yields a two-dome scenario for the superconducting critical temperature as a function of $V_g$. The observed dome in the low-$V_g$ regime is explained by the non-monotonic evolution of a dominant conventional part of the superfluid density. In contrast, the expected second dome at larger values of $V_g$ limit would be due to a dominant quantum-geometric contribution.</description>
