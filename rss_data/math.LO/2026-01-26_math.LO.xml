      <title>Expansions of the group $Z_8$ (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate clones in the interval between the group polynomials and the ring polynomials of ${\mathbb Z}_8$. This is the simplest open case of the problem, as the answer is known for ${\mathbb Z}_{p^2}$ (with $p$ prime) and, in general, ${\mathbb Z}_n$ reduces to the case when $n$ is a prime power. The investigated structure proves to be very complicated, so we provide only a partial description. We restrict our attention to polynomials whose nonlinear monomials have even coefficients.</description>

      <title>Reduction Complexities in Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Ca2016} and \cite{Ca2018}, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in \cite{Ca2025}, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we obtain a considerably refined analysis through interpolating between these two notions: Namely, we ask how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us to make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topos $\mathcal{E}=\mathsf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb{N}})$ arising from a nontrivial finite group $H$ acting freely on Cantor space. Using a local embedding property for the relevant epimorphisms together with effective descent for monomorphisms, we show that the \emph{internal} set universe $V$ obtained from algebraic set theory (AST) inside $\mathcal{E}$ satisfies the Partition Principle. On the other hand, the quotient $q:X\to X/H$ is a small epimorphism in $\mathcal{E}$ with no section, and this yields (via the display interpretation) an internal surjection in $V$ with no internal section; hence $V\models\neg\mathsf{AC}$. In summary, $\mathcal{E}$ contains an internal model of $\mathsf{IZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$ (and if $\mathcal{E}$ is Boolean, equivalently after $\neg\neg$-sheafification, this upgrades to $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$).</description>

      <title>From Internal to External: Classical Models of ZF + PP + $\neg$AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal. We analyze when the Partition Principle ($\mathsf{PP}$) holds without $\mathsf{AC}$ in models arising from a free finite $H$-action on Cantor space, and reconcile two standard routes to such models. Approach. Route I proceeds via a Boolean-valued presentation $\mathrm{Sh}(\mathbb{B})$ and symmetric names; Route II uses direct forcing with $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$ and finite-support automorphisms. We prove a unification theorem identifying the resulting symmetric submodels and develop a Local-to-Global Embedding Principle (LEP) for hereditarily symmetric names. Results. We prove external $\mathsf{PP}$ in the symmetric model $N$ built via Route II. From LEP we obtain that $\mathsf{PP}$ holds in the symmetric model, hence $N\models \mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$. Along the way, we unify the Route I/Route II presentations functorially. Limitations. Our proof exploits the countable-support stratification of $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$; extending the LEP/gluing to uncountable presentations (e.g. $\mathrm{Fn}(\kappa\times H,2)$ for $\kappa&gt;\omega$) or, more generally, to $\kappa$-directed families of finite supports remains open.</description>

      <title>A countable-support symmetric iteration separating PP from AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01855v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, from a ground model of $ZFC$, a transitive symmetric model $M$ satisfying $ZF + DC + PP + AC_{wo} + \neg AC$. The construction starts with a Cohen symmetric seed model $N$ over $Add(\omega,\omega_1)$ and performs an Ord-length countable-support symmetric iteration. For fixed parameters $S:=A^\omega$ and $T:=PowerSet(S)$ (as computed in $N$), successor stages add orbit-symmetrized packages which force the localized splitting principle $PP^{\mathrm{split}}\!\restriction T$ (hence $PP\restriction T$) and the choice principle $AC_{wo}$, while preserving $DC$ and keeping $A$ non-well-orderable. A diagonal-lift/diagonal-cancellation scheme produces $\omega_1$-complete normal limit filters. A persistence argument yields $SVC^+(T)$ in M, and Ryan--Smith localization then upgrades $PP\restriction T$ and $AC_{wo}$ to $PP$.</description>

      <title>Strong Normalization for the Safe Fragment of a Minimal Rewrite System: A Triple-Lexicographic Proof and a Conjecture on the Unprovability of Full Termination for Any Relational Operator-Only TRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a minimal operator-only term rewriting system with seven constructors and eight reduction rules. The main contribution is a mechanically-verified proof of strong normalization for a guarded fragment using a novel triple-lexicographic measure combining a phase bit, multiset ordering (Dershowitz-Manna), and ordinal ranking. From strong normalization, a certified normalizer with proven totality and soundness is derived. Assuming local confluence (verified through critical pair analysis), Newman's Lemma yields confluence and therefore unique normal forms for the safe fragment. Impossibility results showing that simpler measures, such as additive counters, polynomial interpretations, and single-bit flags, provably fail for rules with term duplication, are established. The work demonstrates fundamental limitations in termination proving for self-referential systems. A conjecture is stated: no relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods. Here "relational" is equivalent to "capable of ordered computation": systems with a recursor enabling iteration over successors, comparison, or sequential counting. Such recursors necessarily redistribute step arguments across recursive calls, defeating all additive termination measures. This structural limitation applies to any TRS expressive enough to encode ordered data. All theorems have been formally verified in a proof assistant. The Lean formalization is available at https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Unital Classification Theorem for $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the $KK$-equivalence relation on unital $C^*$-algebras, in the sense of descriptive set theory. We prove that $KK$-equivalence is analytic, which in turn shows that the set of separable $C^*$-algebras satisfying the UCT is analytic. This allows us to prove a game-theoretic refinement of the unital classification theorem: there is a transfer of strategies between Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games (of various lengths) on classifiable $C^*$-algebras and their invariants.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs. We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $\mathsf{AW}[*]\neq \mathsf{FPT}$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>
