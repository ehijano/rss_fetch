      <title>Fluid flow and spatiotemporal chaos in chemically active emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase-separating fluid mixtures as they demix in the presence of chemical reactions that maintain them away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We show that in such chemically active emulsions the interplay of chemical reactions, phase separation, and hydrodynamics effects complex self-organisation and pattern formation that can give rise to spatiotemporal chaos. This chaotic dynamics, unlike in classical turbulence, is not due to fluid inertia $-$ we analyse the system in the Stokes flow regime $-$ and it is different from the $\textit{turbulence}$ of active nematics at low Reynolds number, for our fluid mixtures lack any orientational order. To explore the generic features of nonlinear dynamics in our system, we derive amplitude equations which we find to be identical to those obtained for Rayleigh-Benard convection with mean flow and stress-free conditions at the top and bottom plates. Chemically active emulsions possessing no internal order, we thus establish, can exhibit chaoticity that is driven by interfacial stresses in the fluid mixture.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study on Jet-Like Outwash Induced by Multi-Rotor eVTOLs and Engineering Approaches for Outwash Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational analysis of eVTOL outwash phenomena, emphasizing the impact of rotor geometric configuration and alignment on hazardous airflow patterns at vertiports. Utilizing nondimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the k-omega SST turbulence model in OpenFOAM, the research characterizes jet-like outwash behaviors across multi-rotor eVTOL architectures. Based on this computational framework, the results highlight how propeller count and inter-propeller distance govern outwash intensity, orientation, propagation, and boundary layer structure. For power lift eVTOL, low propeller count with narrow inter-propeller distance generates highly directional and intensified jet-like outwash with the propagation range exceeds the current regulatory safety areas according to FAA EB105a. In contrast, higher propeller counts and wider inter-propeller distance mitigate the maximum velocity and the propagation range of the jet-like outwash, supporting safer vertiport layouts. Additionally, high-propeller-count configurations form vertically stratified and thickened outwash velocity boundary layers. Targeted engineering solutions, such as modular blast deflectors oriented to predicted outwash patterns, demonstrate the potential to reduce vertiport spatial requirements by up to 82% while preserving operational safety. These findings support integration of aircraft and infrastructure design, regulatory compliance, and cost-effective vertiport safety area management for urban air mobility. The work advances engineering responses for pivotal aerodynamic challenges and lays a foundation for future studies on optimal outwash mitigation device geometry and configuration for vertiports.</description>

      <title>Upstream motion of oil droplets in co-axial Ouzo flow due to Marangoni forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the physicochemical hydrodynamics of phase-separating ternary liquids (Ouzo-type), a binary oil-ethanol mixture is introduced into a co-flowing stream of water. Oil droplets nucleate at the interface between the two liquids, leading to a larger oil droplet interacting with the ethanol-rich jet. Although buoyancy forces and hydrodynamic drag forces push the droplet in downstream direction, we observe an upstream motion. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations of a simplified model system, we identify the nucleation zone for oil droplets and uncover Marangoni forces to be responsible for the upstream motion of the droplet. A semi-analytical model allows us to identify the key parameters governing this effect. A general conclusion is that Marangoni stresses can reverse the motion of droplets through channels, where the surrounding liquid is a multi-component mixture. The insights from this work are not only relevant for channel flow, but more generally, for the physicochemical hydrodynamics of multiphase, multi-component systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple droplets dynamics on cylindrical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the descent of a single droplet on a vertical fiber and its role in generating additional droplets. As the droplet slides, it deposits a non-uniform liquid film whose thickness decreases along the fiber. The thicker portion near the release point undergoes a Rayleigh-Plateau instability, leading to the formation of a new droplet. This newly formed droplet initially accelerates by accumulating fluid from the film ahead, then shifts to a decelerating phase once fluid loss at its rear dominates. Ultimately, it merges with the original droplet. This refeeding allows the droplet to travel further. Successive generations of droplets can similarly arise, governed by the evolving film thickness. We develop theoretical models that capture each phase of motion and discuss the experimental and theoretical aspects of this cascading cycle of droplet generation.</description>

      <title>Contact line friction of bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact line friction (CLF) of bubbles is ubiquitous, from bubbles on a beer glass to H2 bubbles sliding over electrodes in electrolysis. However, a fundamental understanding of CLF of bubbles is still missing, mainly due to the challenge of precisely controlling bubble sliding. For example, it is not clear how bubbles start sliding and how CLF of bubbles depends on velocity. We therefore developed a bubble friction force instrument to directly measure bubble CLF. This force develops from a static regime, through a transition, to a kinetic regime. This entire process is quantitatively described by a modified Kawasaki-Furmidge equation. Bubble CLF was measured for velocities from 0.2 micron/s to 2 mm/s, revealing a transition from a constant CLF regime below about 60 micron/s to a velocity-dependent CLF regime on surfaces with various wettability. The velocity dependence stems from interfacial adaptation governed by the liquid ionic environment with a relaxation time of around 10 microsecond. Moreover, CLF of bubbles can be measured on hydrophilic surfaces and under a challenging H2 atmosphere, overcoming the limitations of current droplet-based methods. Our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding CLF of bubbles with relevance to many applications, including bubble manipulation and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Gradient Jump Penalisation in Large-Eddy Simulations of Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of the gradient jump penalisation (GJP) in large eddy simulations (LES) when coupled with active subgrid-scale (SGS) models. GJP is a stabilisation method tailored for the continuous Galerkin spectral element method, aiming at mitigating non-physical oscillations induced by discontinuous velocity gradients across element interfaces. We demonstrate that GJP effectively smoothens fields from LES without a salient impact on flow dynamics for the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) at $Re=1600$, periodic hill flows at bulk Reynolds numbers $Re_b=10595$ and $37000$, as well as turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau} \approx 550$. In the TGV case, the application of GJP results in decreased fluctuations at only high wavenumbers compared to simulations without GJP. The periodic hill flow simulations indicate the applicability of GJP in wall-resolved LES (WRLES) involving curved geometries, though it tends to dissipate some of the finer details in the solution. Finally, in the analysis of the canonical turbulent channel flow cases, GJP leads a higher resolved turbulent kinetic energy than simulations without GJP and direct numerical simulations. GJP's mechanism is identified as providing enhanced dissipation at high wavenumbers but accompanied with insufficient dissipation at low wavenumbers, leading to a pronounced spectral cut-off. Non-physical oscillations on element interfaces are reflected as spikes in the power spectral density. By evaluating the sharpness of the strongest spike, GJP is shown to smoothen the spectra, however without completely removing the gradient jumps at low computational resolution.</description>

      <title>kh2d-solver: A Python Library for Idealized Two-Dimensional Incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python library for simulating two-dimensional incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified shear flows. The solver employs a fractional-step projection method with spectral Poisson solution via Fast Sine Transform, achieving second-order spatial accuracy. Implementation leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Numba JIT compilation for efficient computation. Four canonical test cases explore Reynolds numbers 1000--5000 and Richardson numbers 0.1--0.3: classical shear layer, double shear configuration, rotating flow, and forced turbulence. Statistical analysis using Shannon entropy and complexity indices reveals that double shear layers achieve 2.8$\times$ higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers. The solver runs efficiently on standard desktop hardware, with 384$\times$192 grid simulations completing in approximately 31 minutes. Results demonstrate that mixing efficiency depends on instability generation pathways rather than intensity measures alone, challenging Richardson number-based parameterizations and suggesting refinements for subgrid-scale representation in climate models.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.</description>

      <title>Partially Molten Plumes and Melt-Fingers: Two Modes of Magma-Transport through the Mantle in Terrestrial Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of partially molten mantle in terrestrial bodies, we carried out a linear perturbation analysis and 2-D numerical simulations of magma-matrix flow in a horizontal layer, where decompression melting generates magma that percolates through the convecting matrix. Our study shows that there are two regimes for the upward migration of magma, depending on the melt-buoyancy parameter B_m, which is the ratio of the Stokes velocity of matrix to the percolation velocity of melt, both driven by the melt-buoyancy. At large B_m, the magmatism-mantle upwelling (MMUb) feedback dominates the convective flow in the layer: decompression melting during upwelling enhances magma buoyancy, which further strengthens the upwelling. When a solid layer is overlaid on the partially molten layer, the MMUb feedback induces partially molten plumes that ascend through the solid layer by their melt-buoyancy. At lower B_m, in contrast, a perturbation in the melt-content in the partially molten layer propagates upward as a porosity wave: the perturbation induces a spatial variation in the rate of expansion or contraction of matrix caused by magma migration, leading to an upward shift of the perturbation. When a solid layer is overlaid, the porosity wave develops also along the layer boundary to induce a finger-like magma structure, or melt-finger, that extends upward into the solid layer. The threshold value of B_m for MMUb feedback suggests that it can explain volcanism forming Large Igneous Provinces, but not hotspot volcanism on Earth. Since B_m increases with decreasing matrix viscosity, volcanism caused by the MMUb feedback is likely to have been more important in earlier terrestrial planets where the mantle was hotter and softer. Melt-fingers are, in contrast, expected to have developed in the lunar mantle if a partially molten layer has developed at its base in the history of the Moon.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Solving for Symmetry-Driven PDE dynamics with Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, we have presented a systematic computational framework for analyzing self-similar and traveling wave dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by dynamically factoring out continuous symmetries such as translation and scaling. This is achieved through the use of time-dependent transformations -- what can be viewed as dynamic pinning conditions -- that render the symmetry-invariant solution stationary or slowly varying in rescaled coordinates. The transformation process yields a modified evolution equation coupled with algebraic constraints on the symmetry parameters, resulting in index-2 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The framework accommodates both first-kind and second-kind self-similarity, and directly recovers the self-similarity exponents or wave speeds as part of the solution, upon considering steady-state solutions in the rescaled coordinate frame. To solve the resulting high-index DAE systems, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which naturally integrate PDE residuals and algebraic constraints into a unified loss function. This allows simultaneous inference of both the invariant solution and the transformation properties (such as the speed or the scaling rate without the need for large computational domains, mesh adaptivity, or front tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on four canonical problems: (i) the Nagumo equation exhibiting traveling waves, (ii) the diffusion equation (1D and 2D) with first-kind self-similarity, (iii) the 2D axisymmetric porous medium equation showcasing second-kind self-similarity, and (iv) the Burgers equation, which involves both translational and scaling invariance. The results demonstrate the capability of PINNs to effectively solve these complex PDE-DAE systems, providing a promising tool for studying nonlinear wave and scaling phenomena.</description>

      <title>Variational mode decomposition analysis of the relationship between low-frequency shock-wave oscillations and buffet cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between low-frequency shock-wave oscillations and buffet cells on the main wing of the NASA common research model. The flow conditions were set at a Mach number of 0.85, Reynolds number of 2.27 $\times$ 10$^6$, and angle of attack of 4.82$^{\circ}$. Buffet cells are cellular patterns with spanwise periodicity that propagate toward the wing tip, with nondimensional frequencies (Strouhal numbers) of 0.2--0.6, higher than those of shock oscillations associated with transonic buffet. However, the physical mechanisms driving buffet cells and their interaction with low-frequency shock motion are not fully understood. This study employs variational mode decomposition-based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis applied to unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurement data. The results reveal that the amplitude of buffet cells is not directly coupled to the low-frequency shock-wave oscillations but instead shows correlation with the boundary layer separation state. Strong buffet cell fluctuations persist in regions of sustained separation (midspan), while their amplitude varies with local separation/reattachment dynamics in regions of intermittent separation (outboard). These observations suggest that shock-waves are important to generate the adverse pressure gradient necessary for boundary layer separation, but their influence on buffet cells depends on the resulting separation behavior. This insight from experimental observations in this study is consistent with previous computational studies suggesting that buffet cell behavior depends on boundary layer separation characteristics. Moreover, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of VMD-NCS analysis for investigating nonstationary fluid phenomena with multiple spatial and temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Influence of dissolved gas concentration on the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubbles at the air-liquid interface are important for many natural and industrial processes. Factors influencing the lifetime of such surface bubbles have been investigated extensively, yet the impact of dissolved gas concentration remains unexplored. Here we investigate how the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids depends on the dissolved gas concentration. The bubble lifetime is found to decrease with the dissolved gas concentration. Larger microbubbles at increased gas concentration are found to trigger bubble bursting at earlier times. Combined with the thinning rate of the bubble cap thickness, a scaling law of the bubble lifetime is developed. Our findings may provide new insight on bubble and foam stability.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Flow Control in Hypersonic Rarefied Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method, developed for multiscale simulation of partially ionized plasmas, has been extended to unstructured meshes, enabling the modeling of electromagnetic flows around a hemisphere across near-continuum to rarefied regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma solver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are treated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional fluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through comparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a sphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75 pre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement with the reference and experimental data. The findings reveal that rarefied effects play a significant role in the prediction of electromagnetic flow control, underscoring the necessity of multiscale modeling in plasma flow applications.</description>
