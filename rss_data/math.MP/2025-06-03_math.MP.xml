      <title>Extensions of Schr\"odinger operators that generate $C_0$ contraction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function $\psi$ in a bounded $C^2$ region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assume the detection process is irreversible, its mechanism is time independent and also hard, i.e., detections occur only along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Under these conditions Tumulka argued that the dynamics of $\psi$ must be governed by a $C_0$ contraction semigroup that weakly solves the Schr\"odinger equation and proposed modeling the detector by a time-independent local absorbing boundary condition at $\partial \Omega$. In this paper, we apply the newly discovered theory of boundary quadruples to parameterize all $C_0$ contraction semigroups whose generators extend the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian, and prove a variant of Tumulka's claim: all such evolutions are generated by the placement of (potentially nonlocal) absorbing boundary conditions on $\psi$ along $\partial \Omega$. We combine this result with the work of Werner to show that each $C_0$ contraction semigroup naturally admits a probability distribution for the time of detection along $\partial \Omega$, and we prove for a wide class of absorbing boundary conditions that the probability of the particle being ever detected is equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>Rational and non-rational two-dimensional conformal field theories arising from lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a (finite-dimensional) real Hilbert space $\mathfrak h$ and an orthogonal projection $p$, we consider the associated Heisenberg Lie algebra and the two-dimensional Heisenberg conformal net. Given an even lattice $Q$ in $\mathfrak h$ with respect to the indefinite bilinear form on $\mathfrak h$ defined by $p$, we construct a two-dimensional conformal net ${\mathcal A}_Q$ extending the Heisenberg conformal net. Moreover, with a certain discreteness assumption on the spectrum of the extension, we show that any two-dimensional extension of the Heisenberg conformal net is of the form ${\mathcal A}_Q$ up to unitary equivalence.
  We consider explicit examples of even lattices where $\mathfrak h$ is two-dimensional and $p$ is one-dimensional, and we show that the extended net may have completely rational or non-completely rational chiral (i.e. one-dimensional lightray) components, depending on the choice of lattice. In the non-rational case, we exhibit the braided equivalence of a certain subcategory of the representation category of the chiral Heisenberg net corresponding to the two-dimensional lattice extension.
  Inspired by the charge and braiding structures of these nets, we construct two-dimensional conformal Wightman fields on the same Hilbert spaces. We show that, in some cases, these Wightman fields generate the corresponding extended nets.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>

      <title>A gradient-enhanced approach for stable finite element approximations of reaction-convection-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a micromorphic-based approach for finite element stabilization of reaction-convection-diffusion equations, by gradient enhancement of the field of interest via introducing an auxiliary variable. The well-posedness of the coupled-field approach is established, together with an error estimate. Through a set of 1D and 2D numerical examples the high accuracy and enhanced stability of the approach in approximating solutions associated with complex problems is demonstrated, for situations of varying reactivity and convection.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamical suspension model for blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete thermodynamical analysis for a blood model, based on mixture theory, is performed. The model is developed considering the blood as a suspension of red blood cells (solid component) in the plasma (fluid component), and taking into account the temperature effects. Furthermore, two independent scalar internal variables are introduced accounting for additional dissipative effects. Using Clausius-Duhem inequality, the general thermodynamic restrictions and residual dissipation inequality are derived. The thermodynamic admissibility with the second law of thermodynamics is assessed by means of the extended Coleman-Noll procedure; in one space dimension we exhibit a solution of all the thermodynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof of Existence and Mass Gap for Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills in Four-Dimensional Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a constructive proof that pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on R^4 exists as a nontrivial Wightman quantum field theory and exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Our approach embeds the four-dimensional gauge theory as the zero-mode sector of a five-dimensional orbifold regulator that preserves gauge invariance and reflection positivity. A convergent joint polymer expansion on the Wilson lattice provides uniform control of the continuum (a-&gt;0) and infinite-volume (L-&gt;inf) limits; an Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction yields a unique-vacuum Wightman theory; a nonperturbative BRST/Nielsen argument ensures gauge-parameter independence; a rigorously controlled operator-product expansion matches one-loop beta-function data; and a Sturm-Liouville analysis of five-dimensional fluctuations, combined with transfer-matrix spectral projections, isolates a strictly positive glueball mass m0. All steps rest on explicit epsilon-delta estimates and combinatorial bounds for SU(3), leaving no remaining gap between heuristic physics and mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Evolution of wind-generated shallow water waves in a Benney-Luke equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent papers, denoted by MG24, MG25 in this text, we used the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and its two-dimensional extension, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation to describe the evolution of wind-driven water wave packets in shallow water. Both equations were modified to include the effect of wind forcing, modelled using the Miles critical level instability theory. In this paper that is extended to a Benney-Luke (BL) equation, similarly modified for wind forcing. The motivation is that the BL equation is isotropic in the horizontal space variables, unlike the KP model, and noting that the KdV model is one-dimensional. The modified BL equation is studied using wave modulation theory as in MG24, MG25, and with comprehensive numerical simulations. Despite the very different spatial structure the results show that under the right initial conditions and parameter settings, solitary wave trains emerge as in MG24, MG25.</description>

      <title>On a class of bounded Hermitian operators for the Bell-CHSH inequality in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory is analysed by means of a set of bounded Hermitian operators constructed out of the unitary Weyl operators. These operators allow for both analytic and numerical approaches. While the former relies on the modular theory of Tomita-Takesaki, the latter is devised through an explicit construction of the test functions needed for the localization of the aforementioned operators. The case of causal tangent diamonds in $1+1$ Minkowski spacetime is scrutinized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine V. Arnold's celebrated approach via the Euler-Arnold equation -- describing the geodesic flow on a Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric~\cite{Arnold66} -- with his formulation of the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field~\cite{ar61}. We introduce the \emph{magnetic Euler-Arnold equation}, which is the Eulerian form of the magnetic geodesic flow for an infinite-dimensional magnetic system on a Lie group endowed with a right-invariant metric and a right-invariant closed two-form serving as the magnetic field. As an illustration, we demonstrate that the Korteweg--de Vries equation, the generalized Camassa-Holm equation, the infinite conductivity equation, and the global quasi-geostrophic equations can all be interpreted as magnetic Euler-Arnold equations. In particular, we obtain both local and global well-posedness results for the magnetic Euler-Arnold equation associated with the global quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning continuous variable systems via engineered dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete and continuous variables oftentimes require different treatments in many learning tasks. Identifying the Hamiltonian governing the evolution of a quantum system is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory. While previous works mostly focused on quantum spin systems, where quantum states can be seen as superpositions of discrete bit-strings, relatively little is known about Hamiltonian learning for continuous-variable quantum systems. In this work we focus on learning the Hamiltonian of a bosonic quantum system, a common type of continuous-variable quantum system. This learning task involves an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and unbounded operators, making mathematically rigorous treatments challenging. We introduce an analytic framework to study the effects of strong dissipation in such systems, enabling a rigorous analysis of cat qubit stabilization via engineered dissipation. This framework also supports the development of Heisenberg-limited algorithms for learning general bosonic Hamiltonians with higher-order terms of the creation and annihilation operators. Notably, our scheme requires a total Hamiltonian evolution time that scales only logarithmically with the number of modes and inversely with the precision of the reconstructed coefficients. On a theoretical level, we derive a new quantitative adiabatic approximation estimate for general Lindbladian evolutions with unbounded generators. Finally, we discuss possible experimental implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generic graded contractions of Lie algebras from the perspectives of group cohomology, affine algebraic geometry and monoidal categories. We show that generic graded contractions with a fixed support are classified by a certain abelian group, which we explicitly describe. Analyzing the variety of generic graded contractions as an affine algebraic variety allows us to describe which generic graded contractions define graded degenerations of a given graded Lie algebra. Using the interpretation of generic $G$-graded contractions as lax monoidal structures on the identity endofunctor of the monoidal category of $G$-graded vector spaces, we establish a functorial version of the Weimar-Woods conjecture on equivalence of generic graded contractions.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction techniques for inverse Sturm-Liouville problems with complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is considered, including the two-spectrum inverse problem, the problem of recovering the potential from the Weyl function, as well as the recovery from the spectral function. In all cases the potential in the Sturm-Liouville equation is assumed to be complex valued. A unified approach for the approximate solution of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is developed, based on Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions and their derivatives. Unlike most existing approaches, it allows one to recover not only the complex-valued potential but also the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Efficient accuracy control is implemented. The numerical method is direct. It involves only solving linear systems of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the NSBF representations, while eventually the knowledge only of the first NSBF coefficients leads to the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several test examples.</description>

      <title>Ballistic particle transport and Drude weight in mono-atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the fact that, in the particular case of non-relativistic mono-atomic gases, the particle current operator is proportional to the operator of the total momentum, the particle transport in such systems is always ballistic and fully characterized by a Drude weight $\Delta$. The Drude weight can be calculated as a generalized susceptibility from a generalized Gibbs ensemble. For the case of the integrable one dimensional Bose gas with contact interactions this susceptibility can be obtained exactly and explicitly from a generalized Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism. The result is temperature independent and given by $\Delta = 2 \pi D = 2 k_F$, where $D$ is the density of the gas and $k_F$ its Fermi momentum. Our expression, derived by first principle calculations, confirms a more involved formula obtained heuristically by means of generalized hydrodynamics.</description>

Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>

      <title>Geometric Duality Between Constraints and Gauge Fields: Mirror Symmetry and Spencer Isomorphisms of Compatible Pairs on Principal Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mirror symmetry theory of Spencer cohomology within the geometric framework of constrained systems on principal bundles, revealing deep symmetric structures in constraint geometry. Based on compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ under strong transversality conditions, we construct a systematic family of mirror transformations: from basic sign mirrors $\lambda \mapsto -\lambda$ to general automorphism-induced mirrors $\lambda \mapsto (d\phi)^*(\lambda)$. Our core result proves that these transformations preserve all geometric properties of compatible pairs and induce natural isomorphisms between Spencer cohomology groups. This theory unifies constraint mechanics, gauge field theory, and differential topology, establishing a complete mathematical framework for symmetry analysis of constraint systems and revealing the special mirror structure of Spencer complexes in constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Constructing Two Metrics for Spencer Cohomology: Hodge Decomposition of Constrained Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a metric framework for Spencer complexes based on the geometric theory of compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ in principal bundle constraint systems, solving fundamental technical problems in computing Spencer cohomology of constraint systems. We develop two complementary and geometrically natural metric schemes: a tensor metric based on constraint strength weighting and an induced metric arising from principal bundle curvature geometry, both maintaining deep compatibility with the strong transversality structure of compatible pairs. Through establishing the corresponding Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, we rigorously prove that both metrics provide complete elliptic structures for Spencer complexes, thereby guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness and finite-dimensionality of Hodge decompositions. It reveals that the strong transversality condition of compatible pairs is not only a necessary property of constraint geometry, but also key to the elliptic regularity of Spencer operators, while the introduction of constraint strength functions and curvature weights provides natural weighting mechanisms for metric structures that coordinate with the intrinsic geometry of constraint systems. This theory tries to unify the differential geometric methods of constraint mechanics, cohomological analysis tools of gauge field theory, and classical techniques of Hodge theory in differential topology, establishing a mathematical foundation for understanding and computing topological invariants of complex constraint systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the analogy between collapsing Conformal Field Theories and measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Motivated by this analogy we propose the notion of non-commutative (``quantum") Riemannian d-geometry. We explain how this structure is related to Connes's spectral triples in the case d=1. In the Appendix based on the unpublished joint work with Maxim Kontsevich we discuss deformation theory of Quantum Field Theories as well as an approach to QFTs in the case when the space-time is an arbitrary compact metric space.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic of Coulomb gas integral, Temperley-Lieb type algebras and pure partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $\mathcal{K}_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>

      <title>Super Macdonald polynomials and BPS state counting on the blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomial.</description>

      <title>Projective and anomalous representations of categories and their linearizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We invesigate the relation between projective and anomalous representations of categories, and show how to any anomaly $J\colon \mathcal{C}\to 2\mathrm{Vect}$ one can associate an extension $\mathcal{C}^J$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and a subcategory $\mathcal{C}^J_{\mathrm{ST}}$ of $\mathcal{C}^J$ with the property that: (i) anomalous representations of $\mathcal{C}$ with anomaly $J$ are equivalent to $\mathrm{Vect}$-linear functors $E\colon \mathcal{C}^J\to \mathrm{Vect}$, and (ii) these are in turn equivalent to linear representations of $\mathcal{C}^J_{\mathrm{ST}}$ where "$J$ acts as scalars". This construction, inspired by and generalizing the technique used to linearize anomalous functorial field theories in the physics literature, can be seen as a multi-object version of the classical relation between projective representations of a group $G$, with given $2$-cocycle $\alpha$, and linear representations of the central extension $G^\alpha$ of $G$ associated with $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotics of solution to defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a class of step initial data. A rigorous asymptotic analysis is conducted on the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem by applying Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this process, the construction of the $g$-function is generalized and the method of genus reduction to Riemann-theta function is proposed via conformal transformation and symmetries. It is revealed that for sufficiently large time, the solution manifests a tripartite spatiotemporal structure, i.e., in the left plane-wave region, the solution decays to a modulated plane wave with oscillatory correction; in the central dispersive shock wave region, the solution is governed by a modulated elliptic wave; in the right plane-wave region, the solution converges exponentially to a constant. The results from the long-time asymptotic analysis have been shown to match remarkably well with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new off-shell formulation for six-dimensional conformal supergravity obtained by gauging the 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal algebra in superspace. We provide the complete gauged algebra, which proves to be considerably constrained compared to other conformal superspaces constructed in the past. This formulation is employed to obtain the unique 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ Bach tensor superfield, which describes the multiplet of equations of motions for conformal supergravity, by using a general ansatz fixed by truncation to 6D $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ results. We also translate some results into components for precise matching against the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.

      <title>Hierarchy of coupled Burgers-like equations induced by conditional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that $Q$-conditional symmetries of the classical Burgers' equation express in terms of three functions satisfying a coupled system of Burgers-like equations. The search of conditional symmetries of this system leads to a system of five coupled Burgers-like equations. Using the latter system as a starting point, and iterating the procedure, an infinite hierarchy of systems made of an odd number of coupled Burgers-like equations can be conjectured. Moreover, starting from a pair of Burgers-like equations, a similar hierarchy of systems made of an even number of coupled Burgers-like equations may arise. We prove that these two infinite hierarchies can be unified, and each element of the hierarchy arises from the nonclassical symmetries of the previous one. Writing a generic element of this hierarchy as a matrix Burgers' equation, the existence of the matrix Hopf-Cole transformation allows for its linearization and the determination of its solutions. Finally, it is shown that each element of the hierarchy possesses a five-dimensional Lie algebra of classical point symmetries. Though these Lie algebras are realized in manifolds with different dimensionality, they are all isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Long time quantum-classical correspondence for open systems in trace norm</title>

Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is the 2-truncation $\Gamma^2$ of the $\infty$-groupoid of simplices formed by the underlying lattice $\Gamma$. On such a "2-graph", we model states of 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's \textit{measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows the 2-graph states -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matriex gives it a comonoidal {\it cobraiding} structure. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group lattice 2-gauge theories. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables of discrete 2-Chern-Simons theory from it.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Derivation of the Two-Component Gross--Pitaevskii Equation in the Hard-Core Limit with Uniform-in-Time Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the time-dependent two-component Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation as an effective description of the dynamics of a dilute two-component Bose gas near its ground state, which exhibits a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, in the GP limit. Our main result establishes a uniform-in-time bound on the convergence rate between the many-body dynamics and the effective description, explicitly quantified in terms of the particle number $N$, and also implies a uniform-in-time bound for the one-component case. This improves upon the works of Michelangeli and Olgliati [77, 89] by providing a sharper, $N$-dependent, time-independent convergence rate. Our approach further extends the framework of Benedikter, de Oliveira, and Schlein [10] to the multi-component Bose gas in the hard-core limit setting. More specifically, we develop the necessary Bogoliubov theory to analyze the dynamics of multi-component Bose gases in the GP regime.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of physical gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but also from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, by carefully considering the rates of asymptotic behavior of the various types of gauge transformations through conformal methods, we explain why the physical quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions and the physical gauge group differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

Abstract: We study the essential spectrum, which corresponds to inertia-gravity modes, of the system of equations governing a rotating and self-gravitating gas planet. With certain boundary conditions, we rigorously and precisely characterize the essential spectrum and show how it splits from the portion of the spectrum corresponding to the acoustic modes. The fundamental mathematical tools in our analysis are a generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition and the Lopantinskii conditions.</description>

      <title>R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system of ${\rm BC}_n$ type with five arbitrary constants and propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. For this purpose we extend the Kirillov's ${\rm B}$-type associative Yang-Baxter equations to the similar relations depending on the spectral parameters and the Planck constants. General construction uses the elliptic Shibukawa-Ueno $R$-operator and the Komori-Hikami $K$-operators satisfying reflection equation. Then, using the Felder-Pasquier construction the answer for the Lax pair is also written in terms of the Baxter's 8-vertex $R$-matrix. As a by-product of the constructed Lax pair we also propose ${\rm BC}_n$ type generalization for the elliptic XYZ long-range spin chain, and we present arguments pointing to its integrability.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Explicit isomorphisms for the symmetry algebras of continuous and discrete isotropic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of a parametric Lie algebra encompassing the symmetry algebras of various models, both continuous and discrete. This algebraic structure characterizes the isotropic oscillator (with positive, purely imaginary, and zero frequency) and one of its possible nonlinear deformations. We demonstrate a novel occurrence of this Lie algebra in the framework of maximally superintegrable discretizations of the isotropic harmonic oscillator. In particular, we also show that the continuous model and one of its discretizations admit a Nambu-Hamiltonian structure. Through an in-depth analysis of the properties characterizing the Lie algebra in the abstract setting, for different values of the parameter, we find explicit expressions of the Killing forms and construct explicit isomorphism maps to $\mathfrak{u}_N$, $\mathfrak{gl}_N(\mathbb{R})$, and a semidirect sum of $\mathfrak{so}_N(\mathbb{R})$ with $\mathbb{R}^{N(N+1)/2}$. Notably, due to the above isomorphisms, our formulas hold true for $\mathfrak{su}_N$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_N(\mathbb{R})$ and are valid for arbitrary $N$.</description>

      <title>Stability of shear flows near a boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.00887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is devoted to the study of the linear and nonlinear stability of shear flows and boundary layers for Navier Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the case of small viscosity. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive presentation to recent advances on boundary layers stability. It targets graduate students and researchers in mathematical fluid dynamics and only assumes that the readers have a basic knowledge on ordinary differential equations and complex analysis. No prerequisites are required in fluid mechanics, excepted a basic knowledge on Navier Stokes and Euler equations, including Leray's theorem.
  This book consists of three parts. Part I is devoted to the presentation of classical results and methods: Green functions techniques, resolvent techniques, analytic functions. Part II focuses on the linear analysis, first of Rayleigh equations, then of Orr Sommerfeld equations. This enables the construction of Green functions for Orr Sommerfeld, and then the construction of the resolvent of linearized Navier Stokes equations. Part III details the construction of approximate solutions for the complete nonlinear problem and nonlinear instability results.</description>

      <title>The BRST Double Complex for the Coupling of Gravity to Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider (effective) Quantum General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model (QGR-SM) and clarify whether graviton-ghosts couple to matter particles. To this end, we examine the corresponding BRST and anti-BRST symmetries, which are generated by infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and infinitesimal gauge transformations. In particular, we study their properties and relations: We find that all differentials mutually anticommute, which implies that they form a double complex. In particular, we introduce the total BRST differential as the sum of the diffeomorphism and gauge BRST differentials and similarly the total anti-BRST differential as the sum of the respective anti-BRST differentials. Furthermore, we identify the functionals in particle fields that are (co)cycles up to total derivatives with respect to the diffeomorphism differentials as scalar tensor densities of weight one: This implies that graviton-ghosts decouple from matter particles if and only if the Yang--Mills gauge fixing Lagrange density has said tensor density weight. Moreover, we discuss the relevant gauge fixing fermions: Starting from the de Donder and Lorenz gauge fixing conditions, we introduce a total gauge fixing fermion that generates the complete gauge fixing and ghost Lagrange density of QGR-SM. Finally, we show that the BRST cocomplexes are isomorphic to their corresponding anti-BRST complexes via ghost conjugation. Notably, this relates the BRST cohomologies to their respective anti-BRST homologies.</description>

Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18847v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and accessing information encoded in quantum-mechanical systems. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements, the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, which allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage. This type of measurement significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design a feasible setup preparation procedure that produces well-approximated cyclic tight measurements in every finite dimension.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two-term spectral asymptotics for the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a Lipschitz domain with Robin boundary conditions. The second term is the same as in the case of Neumann boundary conditions. This is valid for Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. For orders at least one and under additional assumptions on the function determining the boundary conditions we derive leading order asymptotics for the difference between Riesz means of Robin and Neumann eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Suppressing parametric resonance of a Hyperloop vehicle using a parametric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of a simple model of a Hyperloop vehicle resulting from the interaction between electromagnetic and aeroelastic forces for both constant and periodically varying coefficients (i.e., parametric excitation). For the constant coefficients, through linear stability analysis, we analytically identify three distinct regions for the physically significant equilibrium point. Further inspection reveals that the system exhibits limit-cycle vibrations in one of these regions. Using the harmonic balance method, we determine the properties of the limit cycle, thereby unravelling the frequency and amplitude that characterize the periodic oscillations of the system's variables. For the varying coefficients case, the stability is studied using Floquet analysis and Hills determinant method. The part of the stability boundary related to parametric resonance has an elliptical shape, while the remaining part remains unchanged. One of the major findings is that a linear parametric force, can suppress or amplify the parametric resonance induced by another parametric force depending on the amplitude of the former. In the context of the Hyperloop system, this means that parametric resonance caused by base excitation-in other words by the linearized parametric electromagnetic force can be suppressed by modulating the coefficient of the aeroelastic force in the same frequency. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the phase difference between the modulation and the base excitation. The origin of the suppression is attributed to the stabilizing character of the parametric aeroelastic force as revealed through energy analysis. We provide analytical expressions for the stability boundaries and for the stability's dependence on the phase shift of the modulation.</description>

      <title>Expansion into the vacuum of stochastic gases with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential; each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. When $s&lt;d$, the expansion is governed by non-local hydrodynamic equations. In the one-dimensional case, we deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit: The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (arXiv:2502.02847).</description>

      <title>Large deviations of SLE(0+) variants in the capacity parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for full chordal, radial, and multichordal SLE(0+) curves parameterized by capacity. The rate function is given by the appropriate variant of the Loewner energy. There are two key novelties in the present work. First, we strengthen the topology in the known chordal LDPs into the topology of full parameterized curves including all curve endpoints. We also obtain LDPs in the space of unparameterized curves. Second, we address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the chordal case, due to the different topological setup. We establish our main results via proving an exponential tightness property and combining it with detailed curve return probability estimates, in the spirit of exponentially good approximations in LDP theory. In the radial case, additional work is required to refine the estimates appearing in the literature. Notably, since we manage to prove a finite-time LDP in a better topology than in earlier literature, return energy estimates follow as a consequence of the return probability estimates.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.
  Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data. Moreover, within the class of solutions with density, we establish the uniqueness under slightly more restrictive conditions on the kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent is obtained numerically to be close to $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the following magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \[ H=(i \nabla +A)^2- \tilde{V}, \] where $\tilde{V}$ is non-negative potential supported over the tube built along a curve which is a local deformation of a straight one, and $B:=\mathrm{rot}(A)$ is a non-zero and local (i.e., a compact supported) magnetic field. Based on some new strategies, we first prove that the magnetic field does not change the essential spectrum of this system. Finally, in the last section of this paper, we establish the sufficient condition such that the discrete spectrum is empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>
