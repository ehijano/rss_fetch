      <title>pH-sensitive spontaneous decay of functionalised carbon dots in solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon quantum dots have become attractive in various applications, such as drug delivery, biological sensing, photocatalysis, and solar cells. Among these, pH sensing via luminescence lifetime measurements of surface-functionalised carbon dots is one application currently investigated for their long lifetime and autonomous operation. In this manuscript, we explore the theoretical connection between excitation lifetimes and the pH value of the surrounding liquid via the protonation and deprotonation of functional groups. Example calculations applied to m-phenylenediamine, phloroglucinol and tethered disperse blue 1 are shown by applying a separation approach treating the electronic wavefunction of functional groups separately from the internal electronic structure of the (large) carbon dot. The bulk of the carbon dot is treated as an environment characterised by its optical spectrum that shifts the transition rates of the functional group. A simple relationship between pH, pKa and mixed fluorescence lifetime is derived from transition rates of the protonated and deprotonated states. pH sensitivity improves when the difference in transition rates is greatest between protonated and deprotonated species, with the greatest sensitivity found where the pKa is close to the pH region of interest. The introduced model can directly be extended to consider multicomponent liquids and multiple protonation states.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for an Efficient Normalizing Flow-Based Solution to the Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Molecular Charge-Transfer Model for Multi-step Auger-Meitner Decay Cascade Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragmentation of molecular cations following inner-shell decay processes in molecules containing heavy elements underpins the x-ray damage effects observed in x-ray scattering measurements of biological and chemical materials, as well as in medical applications involving Auger-electron-emitting radionuclides. Traditionally, these processes are modeled using simulations that describe the electronic structure at an atomic level, thereby omitting molecular bonding effects. This work addresses the gap by introducing a novel approach that couples a decay spawning dynamics algorithm with \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the potential energy surfaces. We apply our method to a model decay cascade following K-shell ionization of IBr and subsequent K$_{\beta}$ fluorescence decay. We examine two competing channels that undergo two decay steps, resulting in ion-pairs with a total +3 charge state. This approach provides a continuous description of the electron transfer dynamics occurring during the multi-step decay cascade and molecular fragmentation, revealing the charge transfer timescale to be approximately 75 fs. Our computed kinetic energies of ion fragments show good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Neural Polarization: Toward Electron Density for Molecules by Extending Equivariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent SO(3)-equivariant models embedded a molecule as a set of single atoms fixed in the three-dimensional space, which is analogous to a ball-and-stick view. This perspective provides a concise view of atom arrangements, however, the surrounding electron density cannot be represented and its polarization effects may be underestimated. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textit{Neural Polarization}, a novel method extending equivariant network by embedding each atom as a pair of fixed and moving points. Motivated by density functional theory, Neural Polarization represents molecules as a space-filling view which includes an electron density, in contrast with a ball-and-stick view. Neural Polarization can flexibly be applied to most type of existing equivariant models. We showed that Neural Polarization can improve prediction performances of existing models over a wide range of targets. Finally, we verified that our method can improve the expressiveness and equivariance in terms of mathematical aspects.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Minimal Distributed Charges: A Conformationally Dependent ESP-Model for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kernel-based method (kernelized minimal distributed charge model - kMDCM) to represent the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) in terms of off-center point charges whose positions adapts to the molecular geometry. Using Gaussian kernels and atom-atom distances as the features, the ESP for water and methanol is shown to improve by at least a factor of two compared with point charge models fit to an ensemble of structures. Combining kMDCM for the electrostatics and reproducing kernels for the bonded terms allows energy-conserving simulation of 2000 water molecules with periodic boundary conditions on the nanosecond time scale.</description>

      <title>On the exact limit of the time-dependent coupled cluster ansatz and its approximations in the real-time equation-of-motion coupled cluster cumulant Green's function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the properties of the recently proposed real-time equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (RT-EOM-CC) cumulant Green's function approach [J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 152, 174113]. We specifically focus on identifying the limitations of the original time-dependent coupled cluster (TDCC) ansatz and propose an enhanced extended TDCC ansatz ensuring the exactness in the expansion limit. Additionally, we introduce a practical cluster-analysis-based approach for characterizing the peaks in the computed spectral function from the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach, which is particularly useful for the assignments of satellite peaks when many-body effects dominate the spectra. Our preliminary numerical tests focus on reproducing, approximating, and characterizing the exact impurity Green's function of the three-site and four-site single impurity Anderson models using the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach. The numerical tests allow us to have a direct comparison between the RT-EOM-CC cumulant Green's function approach and other Green's function approaches in the numerical exact limit.</description>

      <title>Pt nanoparticles dispersed in a metal-organic framework as peroxidase mimics for colorimetric detection of GSH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic skeleton materials have been widely used in catalysis with their porous structure and adsorption properties. Precious metal nanoparticles have good catalytic properties. If the noble metal nanoparticles are adsorbed on the MOFs surface, the active sites can be increased and the catalytic effect of the materials can be greatly improved. We successfully synthesized Pt@ZIF-8 in two steps, the average particle size of Pt nanoparticles is about 3 nm. Pt@ZIF-8 possesses peroxidase activity and can oxidize colorless TMB to oxTMB in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide-like nature of Pt@ZIF-8 is consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Glutathione is a reducing substance that reduces blue oxTMB to colorless oxTMB. This colorimetric method achieves a simple, sensitive and intuitive detection of glutathione. The detection limit of this experiment is low, which is promising in biomolecular detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The review unveils the diverse applications of concerted polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-carbon nanomaterial (CNM) systems, spanning from electromagnetic interference shielding, including elimination of 5G-interference, to piezoelectrics and a variety of sensing modalities (breathing, movement, health monitoring, structural integrity assessments, home monitoring, and seismic acceleration). These materials also excel in biomaterials with applications like tactile skin and COVID-preventing facemasks through sunlight sterilization. Moreover, PVDF-CNMs demonstrate excellence in radar absorption, solar-assisted electricity generation, triboelectric energy harvesting, 3D-4D printing materials, anti-icing covers, anti-stealth materials, and heat-dissipating solids in electronics. Across diverse scientific disciplines, the research merges materials chemistry and engineering, yielding materials with multimodal functionalities. The demand for a comprehensive review stems from the need to synthesize insights from fundamental sciences and technologies, capturing the cutting-edge nature of these materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforced solution of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation with deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of deep neural networks with the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method has marked a significant advancement in solving the Schr\"odinger equation. In this work, we enforce spin symmetry in the neural network-based VMC calculation with modified optimization target. Our method is designed to solve for the ground state and multiple excited states with target spin symmetry at a low computational cost. It predicts accurate energies while maintaining the correct symmetry in strongly correlated systems, even in cases where different spin states are nearly degenerate. Our approach also excels at spin-gap calculations, including the singlet-triplet gap in biradical systems, which is of high interest in photochemistry. Overall, this work establishes a robust framework for efficiently calculating various quantum states with specific spin symmetry in correlated systems, paving the way for novel discoveries in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Rotational and Near-IR Spectra of PbF: Characterization of the Coupled $X_1\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ and $X_2\,^2\Pi_{3/2}$ States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the rotational spectrum of lead monofluoride, PbF, have been extended up to transitions in the \textit{v} = 7 level for $^{208}$PbF in the lowest $X_1\,^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state of the radical and \textit{v} = 5 for the $^{207}$Pb and $^{206}$Pb isotopologues. The data also include a few measurements for $^{204}$PbF in \textit{v} = 0. These new measurements have been combined with existing near-IR measurements of the $X_2 - X_1$ fine-structure transition and a simultaneous multi-isotope fit of the data to an effective isotope-independent ro-vibronic Hamiltonian has been carried out. The resulting parameters fully characterize the vibrational, rotational and hyperfine structure of the combined $X_1 \, / \, X_2$ state of the radical. A pair of opposite parity levels with total angular momentum quantum number, $F=1/2$, in the lowest rotational level, $J=1/2$ of \PbF \,are close in energy and their spacing decreases with vibrational excitation. The experimental results show the spacing decreases to less than 20 MHz at $v=7$ and 8. The experimental work is complemented by new \textit{ab initio} calculations which support the results and allow predictions outside the experimental data range. The calculated radiative lifetimes of the relevant vibrationally excited states are of the order of 50 ms. This work was motivated by interest in using \PbF\, as a vehicle for future probes of the standard model of physics such as placing limits on the electron's electric dipole moment (\eEDM), molecular charge-parity non-conservation and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown effects for example.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Artifacts of Kohn-Sham Density Functionals for Biosimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of unphysical charge density delocalization/fractionalization induced by the self-interaction error of common approximate Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory functionals on simulation of small to medium-size proteins in vacuum. Aside from producing unphysical electron densities and total energies, the vanishing of the HOMO-LUMO gap associated with the unphysical charge delocalization leads to an unphysical low-energy spectrum and catastrophic failure of most popular solvers for the Kohn-Sham (KS) self-consistent field (SCF) problem. We apply a robust quasi-Newton SCF solver [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 26, 6557 (2024)] to obtain solutions for some of these difficult cases. The anatomy of the charge delocalization is revealed by the natural deformation orbitals obtained from the density matrix difference between the Hartree-Fock and KS solutions; the charge delocalization can occur not only between charged fragments (such as in zwitterionic polypeptides) but also may involve neutral fragments. The vanishing-gap phenomenon and troublesome SCF convergence are both attributed to the unphysical KS Fock operator eigenspectra of molecular fragments (e.g., amino acids or their side chains). Analysis of amino acid pairs suggests that the unphysical charge delocalization can be partially ameliorated by the use of {\em some} range-separated hybrid functionals, but not by semilocal or standard hybrid functionals. Last, we demonstrate that solutions without the unphysical charge delocalization can be located even for semilocal KS functionals highly prone to such defects, but such solutions have non-Aufbau character and are unstable with respect to mixing of the non-overlapping "frontier" orbitals.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. II. Numerical Validation and the Role of Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper [C. W. Kim and I. Franco, J. Chem. Phys. 160, XXXXXX (2024)], we developed a theory called MQME-D, which allows us to decompose the overall energy dissipation process in open quantum system dynamics into contributions by individual components of the bath when the subsystem dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation (MQME). Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error evaluation of partial scattering functions obtained from contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to experimental SANS data of polyrotaxane solutions with different contrasts, and have successfully estimated the errors of $S$. The quantitative error estimation of $S$ offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</description>

      <title>Molecular Modelling of Aqueous Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous batteries play an increasingly important role for the development of sustainable and safety-prioritised energy storage solutions. Compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, the cell chemistry in aqueous batteries share many common features with those of electrolyzer and pseudo-capacitor systems because of the involvement of aqueous electrolyte and proton activity. This imposes the needs for a better understanding of the corresponding ion solvation, intercalation and electron transfer processes at atomistic scale. Therefore, this chapter provides an up-to-date overview of molecular modelling techniques and their applications in aqueous batteries. In particular, we emphasize on the dynamical and reactive description of aqueous battery systems brought in by density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulation (DFTMD) and its machine-learning (ML) accelerated counterpart. Moreover, we also cover the recent advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in molecular and materials design of aqueous batteries. Case studies presented here include popular aqueous battery systems, such as water-in-salt electrolytes, proton-coupled cathode materials, Zn-ion batteries as well as organic redox flow batteries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transfer complexes are materials with a wide range of interesting optical and electronic properties. They have seen a great deal of research over the past decade, both in device development as well as research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of charge transfer and transport. Here we present time dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations of the energy levels of the donor-acceptor complexes perylene-TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) and hexamethylbenzene-chloranil. The calculations show a good match to the experimentally measured optical absorption spectra, and indicate that low energy CT absorption bands appear at the dimer/tetramer stage of cocrystal formation. We also report the degree of charge transfer for these complexes in various stoichiometries and compare them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct laser cooling of molecules has made significant progress in recent years. However, the selective cooling and manipulation of molecules based on their isotopic composition, which is ubiquitous in atomic laser cooling, has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate such isotopologue-selective laser cooling of molecules, using barium monofluoride (BaF) as an example. The manipulation of the rare and previously uncooled 136BaF is achieved within a molecular beam containing several isotopologues of significantly higher natural abundance. Our results enable intense molecular beams and high fidelity detection of select low-abundance isotopologues or isotopic mixtures. Such beams are a first step towards isotopologue-selective molecular trapping and will be useful for applications in trace gas analysis, cold chemistry and precision tests of fundamental symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the structure of systems in nonequilibrium steady states necessitates tools that quantify population shifts and associated deformations of equilibrium free energy landscapes under persistent currents. Within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we establish a variant of the Kawasaki--Crooks equality that relates nonequilibrium free energy corrections in driven systems to heat dissipation statistics along time-reversed relaxation trajectories computable with molecular simulation. Using stochastic control theory, we arrive at a variational approach to evaluate the Kawasaki--Crooks equality and use it to estimate distribution functions of order parameters in overdamped Langevin models of active matter, attaining substantial improvement in accuracy over simple perturbative methods.</description>

      <title>Specific versus Nonspecific Solvent Interactions of a Biomolecule in Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solvent interactions, particularly hydration, are vital in chemical and biochemical systems. Model systems unveil microscopic details of such interactions. We uncover a specific hydrogen-bonding motif of the biomolecular building block indole (C$_8$H$_7$N), tryptophan's chromophore, in water: a strong localized $\text{N-H}\cdots\text{OH}_2$ hydrogen bond, alongside unstructured solvent interactions. This insight is revealed from a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of indole's electronic structure in aqueous solution. We have recorded the complete X-ray photoemission and Auger spectrum of aqueous-phase indole, quantitatively explaining all peaks through \emph{ab initio} modeling. The efficient and accurate technique for modeling valence and core photoemission spectra involves the maximum-overlap method and the non-equilibrium polarizable-continuum model. A two-hole electron-population analysis quantitatively describes the Auger spectra. Core-electron binding energies for nitrogen and carbon highlight the specific interaction with a hydrogen-bonded water molecule at the N-H group and otherwise nonspecific solvent interactions.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unleashing the predictive power of molecular dynamics (MD), Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are revolutionizing our ability to simulate chemical systems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.</description>

      <title>Reactions dynamics for X + H2 insertion reactions(X=C(1D), N(2D), O(1D), S(1D)) with Cayley Propagator ring-polymer molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, rate coefficients of four prototypical insertion reactions, X + H2 -- H + XH (X=C(1D), N(2D), O(1D), S(1D)) and associated isotope reactions are calculated based on ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with Cayley propagator (Cayley-RPMD). The associated kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are systematically studied too. The Cayley propagator used in this work increases the stability of numerical integration in RPMD calculations, and also supports a larger evolution time interval, allowing us to reach both high accuracy and efficiency. So, our results do not only provide chemical kinetic data for the title reactions in an extended temperature range, but also consist of experimental results, standard RPMD, and other theoretical methods. The results in this work also reflect that Cayley-RPMD has strong consistency and high reliability in the investigations of chemical dynamics for insertion reactions.</description>

      <title>Electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction: a mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the combination of an advanced double-layer model with electrochemical kinetics to explain electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. It is known from experimental studies that the alkaline hydrogen evolution current shows a strong dependence on the concentration and identity of cations in the electrolyte, but is independent of pH. To explain these effects, we formulate the faradaic current in terms of the electric potential in the double layer, which is calculated using a mean-field model that takes into account the cation and anion sizes as well as the electric dipole moment of water molecules. We propose that the Volmer step consists of two activated processes: a water reduction sub-step, and a sub-step in which a hydroxide ion is transferred away from the reaction plane through the double layer. Either of these sub-steps may limit the rate. The proposed models for these sub-steps qualitatively explain experimental observations, including cation effects, pH-independence, and the trend reversal between gold and platinum electrodes. We also assess the quantitative accuracy of the water-reduction-limited current model; we suggest that the predicted functional relationship is valid as long as the hydrogen bonding structure of water near the electrode is sufficiently maintained.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a differentiable implementation of the local natural orbital coupled cluster (LNOCC) method within the automatic differentiation framework of the PySCFAD package. The implementation is comprehensively tuned for enhanced performance, which enables the calculation of first-order static response properties on medium-sized molecular systems using coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We evaluate the accuracy of our method by benchmarking it against the canonical CCSD(T) reference for nuclear gradients, dipole moments, and geometry optimizations. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of property calculations for chemically interesting systems through the computation of bond orders and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy parameters for a [NiFe]-hydrogenase active site model, along with the simulation of infrared (IR) spectra via ab initio LNO-CC molecular dynamics for a protonated water hexamer.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>
