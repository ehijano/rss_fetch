      <title>From SIMP miracles to WIMP dead ends: navigating the freeze out of MeV-mass dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize here our studies \cite{Chu:2022xuh,Chu:2023jyb,Chu:2024rrv} on two distinct scenarios for MeV-mass thermal dark matter freeze-out. First, we determine the minimal viable mass for dark matter below tens of MeV, considering annihilation into Standard Model particles, including photons, electrons, and neutrinos. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we track heat transfer between sectors and provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases. The results identify fine-tuned regions where neutrino final states permit otherwise excluded p-wave annihilation scenarios. Second, we examine dark matter freeze-out in strongly interacting theories, where the relic abundance can be regulated not only through standard $3\pi \to 2\pi$ annihilation but also via bound-state formation $X$, enabling effective two-body processes $XX \to \pi \pi$ and/or $\pi X \to \pi \pi$. Together, these studies highlight complementary pathways to thermal MeV-mass dark matter.</description>

      <title>Mass-unspecific classifiers for mass-dependent searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for new particles often span a wide range of mass scales, where the shape of both potential signals and the SM background varies significantly. We introduce a multivariate method that fully exploits the correlation between signal and background features and the explored mass scale, and is trained on a sample that is balanced across the entire mass range. The classifiers, either a neural network or a boosted decision tree, produce a continuous output across the full mass range and, at a given mass, achieve nearly the same performance of a classifier specifically trained for that mass.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Proton Decay and Neutrino Masses: Upper Bounds on Standard Model Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon and lepton number are excellent low-energy symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) that tightly constrain the form of its extensions. In this paper we investigate the possibility that these accidental symmetries are violated in the deep UV, in such a way that one multiplet necessary for their violation lives at an intermediate energy scale $M$ above the electroweak scale. We write down the simplest effective operators containing each multiplet that may couple linearly to the SM at the renormalisable level and estimate the dominant contribution of the underlying UV model to the pertinent operators in the SMEFT: the dimension-5 Weinberg operator and the baryon-number-violating operators up to dimension 7. Our results are upper bounds on the scale $M$ for each multiplet--operator pair, derived from neutrino-oscillation data as well as prospective nucleon-decay searches. We also analyse the possibility that both processes are simultaneously explained within a natural UV model. In addition, we advocate that our framework provides a convenient and digestible way of organising the space of UV models that violate these symmetries.</description>

      <title>CP-violating effects of the neutral triple gauge couplings in $Z(\ell\ell)\gamma$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of modern experiments in high-energy physics area is to find deviations from the Standard Model, the theoretical framework which describes data well but is expected to be extended to a more general theory. The anomalous coupling approach provides an opportunity to look for a wide range of new physics effects in different experimental signatures thanks to its model independence. In this work, the neutral triple gauge couplings are considered in $Z(\ell\ell)\gamma$ channel, and an effective field theory is used to parameterize these couplings in the Lagrangian. Neutral triple gauge couplings are triple interactions between $Z$ bosons and photons, and some of them violate CP symmetry. This work presents a study of CP-sensitive variables in the aforementioned channel using special angular variables and matrix-element-based optimal observables. Based on these variables, expected limits on the coupling parameters are set for the conditions of Run II and Run III at LHC experiments, demonstrating the possibility of studying the CP-violation using a neutral triple gauge coupling approach and special CP-sensitive variables.</description>

      <title>New Physics Search with the Optical Dump Concept at Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam-dump experiments offer an opportunity to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. In this work, we explore the use of a high-energy photon beam on a fixed target. Such photons can be produced via Compton backscattering when colliding high-energy electrons with a high-intensity laser pulse, such as in setups of strong-field quantum electrodynamics experiments. We present various options for implementing such photon sources at future facilities and discuss how the photons can be used to search for axion-like particles. We compare the projected sensitivities of the proposed options with existing constraints, projections from current experiments, and direct searches at future colliders.</description>

      <title>First study of polarized proton-proton scattering with small-$x$ helicity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological study of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) using small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, incorporating for the first time single-inclusive jet production data in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) scattering at parton momentum fractions $x &lt; 0.1$. We also simultaneously include double-longitudinal spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering probing $x &lt; 0.1$. Employing the polarized small-$x$ pure-glue calculation of $pp\to gX$ for the jet production cross section, we modify the large-$N_c\&amp;N_f$ KPS-CTT evolution equations by setting $N_f = 0$ to replicate the large-$N_c$ (pure-glue) limit, while retaining external quark flavors for the spinor field operators. We find that the $pp$ data have a considerable impact on the helicity PDFs at small $x$, reducing their uncertainties and leading to a total quark and gluon helicity in the proton for $x &lt; 0.1$ of $-0.04 \pm 0.23$. Combining our analysis with the a recent JAM helicity PDF analysis of the world polarized data, which includes $x &gt; 0.1$, we find a total quark and gluon helicity contribution for $x &gt; 10^{-7}$ of between 0.02 and 0.51.</description>

      <title>Properties of solutions by the Schwinger-Dyson equation at finite temperature and density : A four-fermion interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained. We examine the properties of the SDE solutions and discuss the reasons for this situation.</description>

      <title>Lepton collider imprints of Inelastic dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential for detecting the inelastic dark model (DM) with an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry at various types of lepton colliders. The new gauge boson $Z'$ resulting from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_D$ can act as a portal connecting the Standard Model fermions and DM fermions $\chi$, thereby facilitating the production of $Z'$ and its decay into DM fermions. The mass difference between the excited DM fermion $\chi_2$ and the ground DM fermion $\chi_1$ induces the subsequent decays $\chi_2\to \chi_1 +\text{vis}$, where $\chi_2$ and $\chi_1$ serve as long lived particles and DM candidate, respectively. For the inelastic DM with a mass $m_{\chi_1}$ in the range of (1-100) GeV, we find that the future lepton colliders can probe many regions not accessible by current experiments and provide greater projected sensitivity than the LHC and Belle in previous studies. This suggests that future colliders can provide complementary exploration of the inelastic dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to light neutral hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are crucial non-perturbative components in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), playing a vital role in predictions and understanding of the hadronization process. In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\eta$, $\pi^0$ mesons, and $\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons.</description>

      <title>A $B-$anomaly motivated $Z^\prime$ boson at the energy and precision frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeV-scale $Z^\prime$ bosons with family-dependent couplings can explain some anomalies inferred from $B-$meson measurements of processes involving the $b \rightarrow s l^+l^-$ transition. A $Z^\prime$ originating from kinetically-mixed spontaneously broken $U(1)_{B_3-L_2}$ gauge symmetry has been shown to greatly ameliorate global fits~\cite{Allanach:2024ozu} in a `flavour-preferred' region of parameter space. We provide an exploration of this region at the high luminosity (HL-)LHC with particular attention to which signals could be verified across different discovery modes. Even if the HL-LHC does not discover the $Z^\prime$ boson in a resonant di-lepton channel, a FCC-ee $Z-$pole run would detect oblique corrections to the electroweak precision observables (EWPOs). Changes due to $Z^\prime$-induced non-oblique corrections are unlikely to be detected, to within experimental precision. In any case, the extended discovery potential offered by a 100 TeV $pp-$collider would afford sensitivity to the entire flavour-preferred region and enable a fine-grained and forensic analysis of the~model.</description>

      <title>Beautiful Majorana Higgses at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel collider signature within the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, featuring a Higgs sector composed of a bi-doublet and two triplets. Our study focuses on a region of the parameter space where the $SU(2)_R$ charged gauge boson $W_R$ lies in the multi-TeV regime (3-100 TeV) and the additional Higgs states play a significant role. In this scenario, a heavy neutral Higgs boson $\Delta$ with a dominant $SU(2)_R$ triplet component can be produced in association with either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a massive weak boson. The subsequent decay of the heavy Higgs into Majorana neutrinos $N$ results in displaced lepton signatures, providing a striking manifestation of lepton number violation. Additionally, we explore how the production of $b$-jets in these processes can enhance hadron-collider sensitivity to such signals. A particularly compelling channel, $pp \to b \bar b NN$, offers the exciting possibility of simultaneously probing the spontaneous mass origin of both Dirac fermions and Majorana states. Based on an optimised event selection strategy and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we outline the expected reach at the HL-LHC and future colliders. Our findings demonstrate that this channel probes a region of parameter space where the neutral Higgs triplet and heavy neutrino masses are relatively light ($m_\Delta \lesssim 250$ GeV, $m_N \lesssim 80$ GeV), indirectly constraining the $W_R$ boson to the deep multi-TeV domain, with sensitivity extending up to 70-80 TeV, effectively turning the LHC into a precision machine.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the color structure of the deuteron by solving the light-front QCD Hamiltonian for its six-quark and six-quark-one-gluon components using basis light-front quantization. In this framework, the deuteron wavefunction consists of a singlet-singlet color state as well as additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our analysis shows that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wavefunction. These findings provide new insights into the role of hidden color components in the QCD description of nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization: Advancing a first principles approach for the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our recent progress in applying the basis light-front quantization approach to investigate the nucleon's structure. We solve its wave functions from the eigenstates of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian using a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates are determined for the three-quark, three-quark-gluon, and three-quark-quark-antiquark Fock representations, making them suitable for low-resolution probes. From these wave functions, we compute the nucleon's quark and gluon matter densities, as well as its helicity and transversity distributions, showing qualitative consistency with experimental data. We also determine the quark and gluon helicity contributions to the proton spin and the tensor charges. The resulting light-front wave functions represent a significant step toward a unified description of hadron distribution functions in both longitudinal and transverse momentum space.</description>

      <title>Extending the symmetries of the generalized CP-symmetric 2HDM scalar potential to the Yukawa sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are only six independent types of symmetry-constrained (renormalizable) scalar potentials in the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). For example, the scalar sector symmetry known as $Z_2\otimes\Pi_2$, generated by the simultaneous application of two independent symmetries acting on the scalar fields, and the generalized CP symmetry known as GCP2 yield equivalent 2HDM scalar potentials. A similar situation arises for the scalar sector symmetries known as U(1)$\otimes \Pi_2$ and GCP3, respectively. In this paper, we show that this "degeneracy" remains when the definitions of the corresponding symmetries are extended to the Yukawa sector with three quark generations. The proof involves the exploration of all possible extensions of the corresponding symmetries to the Yukawa sector, consistent with the phenomenological constraints of nonzero quark masses and a nontrivial quark mixing matrix. Moreover, we find that this result is a peculiarity of a Yukawa sector with three quark generations. In particular, with two quark generations, we find that models based on the extension of $Z_2\otimes\Pi_2$ to the Yukawa sector are inequivalent with those based on GCP2.</description>

      <title>Exploring the flavor structure of leptons via diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to explore the flavor structure of leptons using diffusion models, which are known as one of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with the type I seesaw mechanism and train a neural network to generate the neutrino mass matrix. By utilizing transfer learning, the diffusion model generates 104 solutions that are consistent with the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing angles. The distributions of the CP phases and the sums of neutrino masses, which are not included in the conditional labels but are calculated from the solutions, exhibit non-trivial tendencies. In addition, the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is concentrated near the boundaries of the existing confidence intervals, allowing us to verify the obtained solutions through future experiments. An inverse approach using the diffusion model is expected to facilitate the experimental verification of flavor models from a perspective distinct from conventional analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the mass scales of order $\sim 6 $ TeV, possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>The impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurements with the SMOG2 program at LHCb on the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the potential impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurement within the SMOG2 fixed-target program at the LHCb experiment on nuclear parton distribution functions. Following~\cite{Bursche:2018orf}, we assume that SMOG2 will collect data for five nuclear targets: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and hydrogen which will provide a baseline for constructing nuclear ratios. The analysis is performed by using the PDF reweighting method. We demonstrate that such a measurement will allow to considerably reduce the current uncertainties of the nuclear gluon distribution and, to some extent, even the uncertainties of the light sea-quark distributions. Furthermore, it will provide the first possibility to systematically study the current assumptions on the $A$-dependence of the nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ by using compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of the near-threshold exotic hadrons, $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$, are studied by respecting the decay and coupled-channel contributions. The effective field theory model is introduced to calculate the compositeness, the probability of finding the hadronic molecular component. Applying the new interpretation scheme for the complex compositeness of unstable states and using the bare energies of the compact component estimated by the constituent quark model, we find that approximately 50 % of the $T_{cc}$ wavefunction is occupied by the $D^{0}D^{*+}$ molecular component. This indicates that the structure of $T_{cc}$ is primarily dominated by the $D^0D^{*+}$ component, having the nearest threshold. However, other components, such as the isospin partner $D^{*0}D^{+}$ channels, also provide non-negligible contributions. On the other hand, about 90 % of $X(3872)$ is composed of the $D^{0}\bar{D}^{0*}$ molecular component. This is because the non-composite bare state and the charged $D\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold are located relatively far from the $X(3872)$ and contribute very little to its internal structure.</description>

      <title>Transitioning to Memory Burden: Detectable Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that black holes are subjected to the memory burden effect, implying that after certain time the information stored in them suppresses the decay rate. This effect opens up a new window for small primordial black holes (PBHs) below $10^{15}\,{\rm g}$ as dark matter. We show that the smooth transition from semi-classical evaporation to the memory-burdened phase strongly impacts observational bounds on the abundance of small PBHs. The most stringent constraints come from present-day fluxes of astrophysical particles. Remarkably, currently-transitioning small PBHs are detectable through high-energetic neutrino events.</description>

      <title>Effects of dissipation on phase diagram and bosonic excitations in the quark-meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the quark-meson model within a real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour. First, we discuss in detail the symmetry of thermal equilibrium for the fermionic sector of the Keldysh action. We take into account dissipation for the bosonic degrees of freedom in the spirit of the Caldeira-Leggett model by coupling the system to an $O(4)$ invariant external heat bath. We study the effect of dissipation on static equilibrium properties, most prominently on the FRG flow of the effective potential and thus on the resulting phase diagram. We find that, unlike in classical systems, through the contributions from non-zero Matsubara modes the dissipative dynamics can in general have an effect on static observables. We investigate these effects within two phenomenological models for the temperature dependence of the pion damping to verify that they are quantitatively small. To estimate their largest possible influence, we consider limits where the damping constants approach infinity.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design Report for the MATHUSLA Long-Lived Particle Detector near CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for the MATHUSLA (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL pArticles) long-lived particle detector at the HL-LHC, covering the design, fabrication and installation at CERN Point 5. MATHUSLA is a 40 m-scale detector with an air-filled decay volume that is instrumented with scintillator tracking detectors, to be located near CMS. Its large size, close proximity to the CMS interaction point and about 100 m of rock shielding from HL-LHC backgrounds allows it to detect LLP production rates and lifetimes that are one to two orders of magnitude beyond the ultimate sensitivity of the HL-LHC main detectors for many highly motivated LLP signals. Data taking is projected to commence with the start of HL-LHC operations. We present a new 40m design for the detector: its individual scintillator bars and wavelength-shifting fibers, their organization into tracking layers, tracking modules, tower modules and the veto detector; define a high-level design for the supporting electronics, DAQ and trigger system, including supplying a hardware trigger signal to CMS to record the LLP production event; outline computing systems, civil engineering and safety considerations; and present preliminary cost estimates and timelines for the project. We also conduct detailed simulation studies of the important cosmic ray and HL-LHC muon backgrounds, implementing full track/vertex reconstruction and background rejection, to ultimately demonstrate high signal efficiency and $\ll 1$ background event in realistic LLP searches for the main physics targets at MATHUSLA. This sensitivity is robust with respect to detector design or background simulation details. Appendices provide various supplemental information.</description>

      <title>Does Memory Burden Open a New Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the so-called memory-burden effect could cause black holes to become stabilized by the information that they carry, thereby suppressing the rate at which they undergo Hawking evaporation. It has furthermore been suggested that this opens a new mass window, between $10^{4}\,{\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{10}\,{\rm g}$, over which primordial black holes could constitute the dark matter of our Universe. We show in this \textit{letter} that this is true only if the transition from the semi-classical phase of a black hole to its memory-burdened phase is practically instantaneous. If this transition is instead more continuous, Hawking evaporation will persist at relevant levels throughout the eras of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination, leading to stringent constraints which rule out the possibility that black holes lighter than $\sim 4 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ could make up all or most of the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Cosmological Massive Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in cosmology is whether massive neutrinos exist on cosmic scales. Current cosmological observations have severely compressed the viable range for neutrino masses and even prefer phenomenologically an effective negative mass. This poses a great challenge to the cosmological search for neutrinos. Based on current background and large scale structure data, taking a full redshift and/or scale tomography method, we find one beyond $5\,\sigma$, two $3\,\sigma$ and two $2\,\sigma$ evidences of massive neutrinos, spanning both high and low redshifts, as well as both small and intermediate scales. Interestingly, these five neutrino masses are well consistent within $1\,\sigma$ confidence level, indicating a possible suppression of neutrino mass during the evolution of the universe. Using cosmic microwave background observations to constrain a redshift and scale dependent neutrino mass, we make the first neutrino mass map through the cosmic history and full scales for future high precision search.</description>

Abstract: The Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) is one of the three experiments of the Nuclotron Ion Collider-fAcility (NICA) complex, which is currently under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. With collisions of heavy ions in the collider mode, the MPD will cover the energy range 4-11 GeV to scan the high baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram. With expected statistics of 50-100 million events collected during the first run, MPD will be able to study a number of observables, including measurements of light hadrons and hypernuclei production, particle flow, correlations and fluctuations, have a first look at dielectron production, and modification of vector-meson properties in dense matter. In this paper, we present selected results of the physics feasibility studies for the MPD experiment in Bismuth-Bismuth collisions at an energy of 9.2 GeV, the system considered as one of the first available at the NICA collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state for dense nuclear matter in $\beta$-equilibrium is explored including the possibility of a doubly-strange H-particle. Consistent with experimental constraints, the mass of the H in free space is taken to be near the $\Lambda \, \Lambda$ threshold. Within the quark-meson coupling model, which we use, no new parameters are required to describe the interaction between the H-dibaryon and the other baryons. The maximum mass is only slightly reduced, and the tidal deformability is essentially unchanged with this addition. In heavy neutron stars the H is abundant and extends as far as 6 km from the center of the core.</description>

This raises the question of the potential effects on neutron stars if it does exist. We explore the consequences within the quark-meson coupling model, using the excluded volume formalism.

      <title>AliCPT Sensitivity to Cosmic Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first assessment of the perspectives to study the reheating epoch after cosmic inflation with the Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT). AliCPT's sensitivity to the reheating temperature $T_{\text{re}}$ is primarily driven by its ability to detect primordial gravitational waves. Working in $\alpha$-attractor T-models of inflation and assuming a fiducial value of $r=0.01$, we find that AliCPT-1, in its fully loaded focal plane detector configuration and combined with Planck, can provide measurements of ${\rm log}_{10}(T_{\text{re}}[\text{GeV}]) = 12.04\pm2.55$. This translates into a bound on the inflaton coupling to other particles, requiring the related coupling constant to exceed the magnitude of the electron Yukawa coupling in the Standard Model if reheating is driven by an axion-like or Yukawa coupling. Our results are the first demonstration of AliCPT's ability to increase our knowledge about the initial temperature of the hot big bang and the microphysical parameter connecting cosmic inflation and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the orbital period of Kerr-Newman black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the orbital period of Kerr black holes, Hod proposed a conjecture that a general lower bound on the orbital period may exist. In this work, we examined this bound by exploring the orbital period of Kerr-Newman black holes using analytical and numerical methods. By choosing different charge and spin of Kerr-Newman black holes, we found a lower bound for the orbital period of Kerr-Newman black holes as $T(r)\geqslant 4\pi M$, where $r$ is the orbital radius, $T(r)$ is the orbital period observed from infinity and $M$ is the black hole mass. This bound is just the same as Hod's conjectured lower bound. So our results further demonstrated that Hod's lower bound may be a general property in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>

      <title>SBN@CERN: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&amp;D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

Abstract: Palatini $F(R,X)$ gravity, with X the inflaton kinetic term, proved to be a powerful framework for generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Here we show that a quadratic Palatini $F(R,X)$ restores compatibility with data of the Peebles-Vilenkin quintessential model. Morever, the same can be achieved with an exponential version of the Peebles-Vilenkin potential if embedded in a Palatini $F(R,X)$ of order higher than two.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson pair production and decay at NLO in QCD: the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs boson pair production at the LHC provides a probe to the Higgs boson self-coupling. The higher-order QCD corrections in this process are sizable and must be taken into account in comparison with data. Due to the small cross section, it is necessary to consider at least one of the Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quarks. The QCD corrections to the decay processes would also be important in such cases. We present a full calculation of the total and differential cross sections for the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state with next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. After applying typical kinematic cuts in the final state, we find that QCD NLO corrections in the decay decrease the LO result by $19\%$ and reduce the scale uncertainties by a factor of two. The QCD corrections to the invariant mass $m_{jj\gamma\gamma}$ distribution, the transverse momentum spectra of the leading bottom quark jet and photon are significant and can not be approximated by a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda(1405)$ has been one of the most controversial exotic baryons. If the $\Lambda(1405)$ possesses a two-pole molecular structure, these poles are expected to evolve differently towards the SU(3) limit.
  From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time the trajectories of these poles towards the symmetric point over the $\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C$ trajectory accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point of this trajectory, both poles are on the physical sheet, and the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1573(6)(6)$ MeV, becoming a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole at $E^{(8a)}=1589(7)(5)$ MeV couples to the octet representation. Moreover, we make predictions in $I=1$ for the $\Sigma^*$ resonance. We find a resonance pole that evolves into a bound state around $m_\pi=415$~MeV in this sector. The results presented here are crucial to shed light on the molecular nature of exotic strange baryon resonances and can be tested in future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in Froggatt-Nielsen flavour models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) are a powerful probe of the earliest moments in the Universe, enabling us to test fundamental interactions at energy scales beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. In this work, we assess the GW capability to probe the origin of the flavour sector of the Standard Model (SM). Within the context of Froggatt-Nielsen models of fermion masses and mixing based on a gauged $U(1)$ flavour symmetry, we investigate the formation of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic GW background (GWB), estimating the sensitivity to the model's parameter space of future GW experiments. Comparing these results with the bounds from low-energy flavour observables, we find that these two types of experimental probes of the model are nicely complementary. Flavour physics observables can probe low to intermediate symmetry-breaking scales $v_\phi$, while future GW experiments are sensitive to the opposite regime, for which the string tension is large enough to yield sizeable GW signals, and in the long run can set an upper limit on the scale as stringent as $v_\phi \lesssim 10^9$ GeV. In certain scenarios, the combination of flavour constraints and future GW bounds can bring about a complete closure of the available parameter space, which illustrates how GWB searches can play an important role in testing the origin of the SM flavour sector even if that occurs at ultra-high energies.</description>

Abstract: The semileptonic $B_{(s)} \rightarrow T(J^P=2^-)l^+l^-$ decays induced by flavor changing neural currents are investigated within the light cone QCD sum rule method. We apply the $B$ meson distribution amplitudes up to twist-4 and calculate the relevant form factors of the $B_{(s)} \rightarrow T$ transitions, where $T=K_2,~a_2,~f_2,~\phi_2$ with $J^P=2^-$. The obtained results of the form factors then adopted in the calculations of the corresponding widths. The present results can be used in future experiments for studying the properties of $J^P=2^-$ tensor mesons.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions of the kaon and pion within the nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we explore the properties of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for the kaon and pion within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM). Valence quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are analyzed with respect to their momentum fraction $x$ and skewness $\xi$ dependencies in the DGLAP and ERBL regions. We observe that the asymmetry of the current quark masses in kaon results in a significant distortion of the quark GPDs in kaon near $\xi=1$, compared to the case of the pion. The quark GPDs of the kaon and pion are evolved to $\mu^2 = 4$ GeV$^2$ and 100 GeV$^2$ by the QCD evolution equation at one-loop order using the \texttt{APFEL++} package. We find that the produced sea quarks and gluons are largely suppressed as $\xi$ becomes nonzero, predominantly confined within the ERBL region. We subsequently examine the polynomiality of the GPDs and numerically obtain the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the kaon and pion. For the kaon, gravitational form factor ratios $A_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/A_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.26$ and $D_{\bar s/K^+}(0)/D_{s/K^+}(0) = 1.10$ are reported and compared with results from other effective models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scale Variations: Perturbative Theory Uncertainties from Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to estimate the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in perturbative predictions (the perturbative "theory uncertainty"), which overcomes many inherent limitations of the currently prevalent methods based on varying unphysical renormalization scales. In our approach, the true underlying sources of the theory uncertainty, namely the missing higher-order terms, are identified and parameterized in terms of mutually independent theory nuisance parameters (TNPs). The TNPs are true parameters of the calculation, i.e., they have a well-defined true value that is not or only imprecisely known. This approach affords the theory uncertainty all benefits of a truly parametric uncertainty: It provides correct correlations and allows for consistent error propagation and combination. Furthermore, the TNPs can be profiled in fits, allowing the data to reduce the theory uncertainties. On the theory side, it allows maximally exploiting all available higher-order information to reduce the theory uncertainty, such as partial higher-order results or any nontrivial knowledge of the higher-order or all-order structure. We first discuss the method in general as it can be applied across the board of perturbative calculations. As a concrete application, we then discuss the resummed transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum in Drell-Yan production, and how TNP-based uncertainties can correctly capture the correlations across the $q_T$ spectrum and between $Z$ and $W$ production. This application is the basis of the theory model enabling the recent precise measurement of the $W$-boson mass by the CMS experiment. In a forthcoming paper, we use it to study the theory uncertainties in extracting the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Towards UV-Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter VII: A Light Dark Photon in the $3_c3_L1_A1_B$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing (KM) portal, by which the Standard Model (SM) photon mixes with a light dark photon arising from a new $U(1)_D$ gauge group, allows for the possibility of viable scenarios of sub-GeV thermal dark matter (DM) with appropriately suppressed couplings to the SM. This KM can only occur if particles having both SM and dark quantum numbers, here termed portal matter (PM), also exist. The presence of such types of states and the strong suggestion of a need to embed $U(1)_D$ into a non-abelian gauge structure not too far above the TeV scale based on the RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling is potentially indicative of an enlarged group linking together the visible and dark sectors. The gauge group $G=SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_A\times U(1)_B=3_c3_L1_A1_B$ is perhaps the simplest setup wherein the SM and dark interactions are partially unified in a non-abelian fashion that is not a simple product group of the form $G=G_{SM}\times G_D$ encountered frequently in earlier work. The present paper describes the implications and phenomenology of this type of setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the consequences of new long-range forces between neutrinos on cosmic scales. If these forces are a few orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, they can induce perturbation instability in the non-relativistic cosmic neutrino background in the late time universe. As a result, the cosmic neutrino background may form nonlinear bound states instead of free-streaming. The implications of the formation of nonlinear neutrino bound states include enhancing matter perturbations and triggering star formation. Based on existing measurements of the matter power spectrum and reionization history, we place new constraints on long-range forces between neutrinos with ranges lying in $1 \text{ kpc}\lesssim m_\phi^{-1} \lesssim 10 \text{ Mpc}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the scalar potential and investigate a couple of scenarios for the symmetry breaking mechanisms with a dilaton model which is derived from the geometry. We examine the LHC constraints for the couplings of Higgs-weak vector bosons and Higgs self-couplings in this model, which identifies the parameter space where the discovered Higgs boson $m_h=125$ GeV can be dilaton dominant and the features of Higgs self-couplings are explored. It is found that via the measurement of Higgs pair production, the High Luminosity LHC running can either confirm or rule out the dilaton dominance.</description>

      <title>All axion dark matter from supersymmetric models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models accompanied by certain anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries Z_n^R are attractive in that 1. the R-symmetry (which can arise from compactified string theory as a remnant of the broken 10-d Lorentz symmetry) forbids unwanted superpotential terms while allowing for the generation of an accidental, approximate global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry needed to solve the strong CP problem and 2. they provide a raison d'etre for an otherwise ad-hoc R-parity conservation. We augment the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by two additional Z_n^R- and PQ-charged fields X and Y wherein SUSY breaking at an intermediate scale m_{hidden} leads to PQ breaking at a scale f_a\sim 10^{11} GeV leading to a SUSY DFSZ axion. The same SUSY breaking can trigger R-parity breaking via higher-dimensional operators leading to tiny R-violating couplings of order (f_a/m_P)^N and a WIMP quality problem. For Z_4^R and Z_8^R, we find only an N=1 suppression. Then the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) of the MSSM becomes unstable with a lifetime of order ~ 10^{-3}-10 seconds so the LSPs all decay away before the present epoch. That leaves a universe with all axion cold dark matter and no WIMPs in accord with recent LZ-2024 WIMP search results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of a sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Attractive features of Higgsino Dark Matter in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Higgsino dark matter(DM) scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the mixing of Gaugino and Higgsino influences the mass splitting between neutralinos predominantly composed of Higgsino and introduces coupling between the DM and Higgs bosons. These effects modify the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, causing conflicts with the latest direct detection results from LZ experiments for both substantial and minute mixings. Consequently, the experimental measurement of DM relic density necessitates the Higgsino DM mass to be approximately 1.1 TeV. We discovered that in the Higgsino DM scenario of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model(NMSSM), the mixing of Higgsino and Singlino introduces analogous effects, with a crucial distinction being that the current LZ experiment permits significant mixing between Singlino and Higgsino. This pronounced mixing effect effectively attenuates the interactions between Higgsino-dominated neutralinos and standard model particles, enabling DM masses exceeding roughly 660 GeV to achieve the correct relic abundance. Through analytical formulas and numerical results, we elucidated these characteristics. Our research reveals that in the NMSSM, when comprehensively examining the mixing effects of Higgsino, Gaugino, and Singlino, the properties of Higgsino DM become markedly more intricate compared to the MSSM predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize light-cone QCD sum rules at twist-3 accuracy to compute the coupling parameters of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state with $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The analysis reveals that the observed $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ meson incorporates significant amounts of both charmonium and molecular components. Additionally, the interplay between these components highlights the exotic nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. Furthermore, implications for a possible mixing between a $\chi_{b1}(nP)$ state and a potential $B\bar{B}^*$ molecule is discussed. These findings contribute to the understanding of exotic hadron states and their intricate internal structures.</description>

      <title>Refining Fast Calorimeter Simulations with a Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based simulations, especially calorimeter simulations, are promising tools for approximating the precision of classical high energy physics simulations with a fraction of the generation time. Nearly all methods proposed so far learn neural networks that map a random variable with a known probability density, like a Gaussian, to realistic-looking events. In many cases, physics events are not close to Gaussian and so these neural networks have to learn a highly complex function. We study an alternative approach: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge Quality Improvement via Refinement of Existing Lightweight Simulations (SQuIRELS). SQuIRELS leverages the power of diffusion-based neural networks and Schr\"{o}dinger bridges to map between samples where the probability density is not known explicitly. We apply SQuIRELS to the task of refining a classical fast simulation to approximate a full classical simulation. On simulated calorimeter events, we find that SQuIRELS is able to reproduce highly non-trivial features of the full simulation with a fraction of the generation time.</description>

Abstract: We present the electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation flux from an eccentric Keplerian binary endowed with scalar charges, in the presence of scalar-photon coupling $\phi A_\mu A^\mu$ or $\phi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The scalar radiation is suppressed for orbital frequency below the scalar mass, while the scalar-mediated indirect EM radiation survives. We examine the constraints imposed on the scalar-photon and scalar-charge couplings by the current observational data, in case that the scalar charge is given by the muon number. The extensions of our calculation to the quadrupole order and hyperbolic orbit are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tools for probing new physics with newly discovered gamma-ray targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly available gamma-ray data off-axis from the region of interest. This background model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. A major application of this tool would be in searching for dark matter annihilation in newly discovered astrophysical targets. For this purpose, we derive a scaling relation for determining velocity-dependent $J$-factors using only the stellar parameters, which can be broadly applied to obtain dark matter constraints from new targets. As an application of these tools, we use TweedleDEE and MADHATv2 to perform the first search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls using fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider two different scenarios: first, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic three-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls during head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regard to stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are classically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With regard to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on many different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparency and shadowing of the two-step process in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear transparency induced by pion electroproduction on nuclei $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ with our interest in the role of the two-step process in the Glauber multiple scattering theory. Based on the framework in which the short-range correlation and the quantum diffusion model are incorporated into the Glauber theory, the experimental data in the range of photon virtuality $0.5&lt; Q^2&lt; 10$ GeV$^2/c^2$ are analyzed, including the recent JLab data at 6 GeV electron beam together with the proposal for 12 GeV upgrade. The application of the quantum diffusion model during the formation length of the quark/antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ pair in the final state of pion reproduces the increase in the nuclear transparency up to the increase of high $Q^2$, showing evidence for color transparency. In particular, through the coherent length of the $\gamma^*$ fluctuation into $\rho^0$, the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section chosen to be $\sigma_{\rho N}=\sigma_{\pi N}$ also contributes to an increase in the nuclear transparency in the low $Q^2$ region. Combined with the one-step process (direct photon coupling) usually adopted in the original formulation of the Glauber theory, this reaction mechanism provides another source of the $Q^2$ dependence of the transparency at low virtualities through the shadowing in the initial state interaction. By the further attenuation due to the shadowing, a better agreement is obtained with the pion transparency measured in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the finite basis topologies of two-loop dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme in the Standard Model. We present a functionally distinct finite basis of Master Integrals which spans the whole transcendental space of all two-loop Feynman integrals with external momenta in four dimensions. We also indicate that all the two-loop Master Integrals, in an appropriate basis, with more than 8 denominators do not contribute to the finite part of any two-loop scattering amplitude. In addition, we elaborate on the application of the `t Hooft-Veltman decomposition to improve the performance of numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals using AMFlow and DCT packages. Moreover, we analyze the spectrum of special functions and the corresponding geometries appearing in any two-loop scattering amplitude. Our work will allow for a reduction in the computational complexity required for providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>
