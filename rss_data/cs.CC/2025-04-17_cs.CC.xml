      <title>Reachability in Geometrically $d$-Dimensional VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability of vector addition systems with states (VASS) is Ackermann complete~\cite{leroux2021reachability,czerwinski2021reachability}. For $d$-dimensional VASS reachability it is known that the problem is NP-complete~\cite{HaaseKreutzerOuaknineWorrell2009} when $d=1$, PSPACE-complete~\cite{BlondinFinkelGoellerHaaseMcKenzie2015} when $d=2$, and in $\mathbf{F}_d$~\cite{FuYangZheng2024} when $d&gt;2$. A geometrically $d$-dimensional VASS is a $D$-dimensional VASS for some $D\ge d$ such that the space spanned by the displacements of the circular paths admitted in the $D$-dimensional VASS is $d$-dimensional. It is proved that the $\mathbf{F}_d$ upper bounds remain valid for the reachability problem in the geometrically $d$-dimensional VASSes with $d&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the \(N\)-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients \(X_{k\sqrt{N}}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1\) -- can be losslessly compressed from \(N\) to \(\sqrt{N}\) points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of \(\mathbf{x}\) are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of several fortification-interdiction games in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fortification-interdiction games are tri-level adversarial games where two opponents act in succession to protect, disrupt and simply use an infrastructure for a specific purpose. Many such games have been formulated and tackled in the literature through specific algorithmic methods, however very few investigations exist on the completeness of such fortification problems in order to locate them rigorously in the polynomial hierarchy. We clarify the completeness status of several well-known fortification problems, such as the Tri-level Interdiction Knapsack Problem with unit fortification and attack weights, the Max-flow Interdiction Problem and Shortest Path Interdiction Problem with Fortification, the Multi-level Critical Node Problem with unit weights, as well as a well-studied electric grid defence planning problem. For all of these problems, we prove their completeness either for the $\Sigma^p_2$ or the $\Sigma^p_3$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. We also prove that the Multi-level Fortification-Interdiction Knapsack Problem with an arbitrary number of protection and interdiction rounds and unit fortification and attack weights is complete for any level of the polynomial hierarchy, therefore providing a useful basis for further attempts at proving the completeness of protection-interdiction games at any level of said hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Unitary Property Testing with Proofs and Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In unitary property testing a quantum algorithm, also known as a tester, is given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it satisfies some property. We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of unitary property testing and related problems, which utilises its connection to unitary channel discrimination. The main advantage of this technique is that all obtained lower bounds hold for any $\mathsf{C}$-tester with $\mathsf{C} \subseteq \mathsf{QMA}(2)/\mathsf{qpoly}$, showing that even having access to both (unentangled) quantum proofs and advice does not help for many unitary property testing problems. We apply our technique to prove lower bounds for problems like quantum phase estimation, the entanglement entropy problem, quantum Gibbs sampling and more, removing all logarithmic factors in the lower bounds obtained by the sample-to-query lifting theorem of Wang and Zhang (2023). As a direct corollary, we show that there exist quantum oracles relative to which $\mathsf{QMA}(2) \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$ and $\mathsf{QMA}/\mathsf{qpoly} \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$. The former shows that, at least in a black-box way, having unentangled quantum proofs does not help in solving problems that require high precision.</description>
