      <title>Oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics driven by surface curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>
