      <title>Accurate bootstrap bounds from optimal interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new methods for approximating conformal blocks as positive functions times polynomials, with applications to the numerical bootstrap. We argue that to obtain accurate bootstrap bounds, conformal block approximations should minimize a certain error norm related to the asymptotics of dispersive functionals. This error norm can be made small using interpolation nodes with an appropriate optimal density. The optimal density turns out to satisfy a kind of force-balance equation for charges in one dimension, which can be solved using standard techniques from large-N matrix models. We also describe how to use optimal density interpolation nodes to improve condition numbers inside the semidefinite program solver SDPB. Altogether, our new approximation scheme and improvements to condition numbers lead to more accurate bootstrap bounds with fewer computational resources. They were crucial in the recent bootstrap study of stress tensors in the 3d Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>$\hat{Z}$-TQFT, Surgery Formulas, and New Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\hat{Z}$ invariants of three-manifolds introduced by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa have influenced many areas of mathematics and physics. However, their TQFT structure remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a framework of decorated $\mathrm{Spin}$-TQFTs and construct one based on Atiyah-Segal-like axioms that computes the $\hat{Z}$ invariants. Central to our approach is a novel quantization of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory and a $\mathbb{Q}$-extension of the algebra of observables on the torus, from which we obtain the torus state space of the $\hat{Z}$-TQFT. Using the torus state space and topological invariance, we uniquely determine the $\hat{Z}$ invariants for negative-definite plumbed manifolds. Within this TQFT framework, we establish gluing, rational surgery, partial surgery, satellite, and cabling formulas, as well as explicit closed-form expressions for Seifert manifolds and torus link complements. We also generalize these constructions to higher-rank gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in Open Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the holographic realization of a conformal theory coupled to an external bath realized via a double trace deformation and its gravity dual in terms of transparent boundary conditions in order to map out some basic dissipative properties of this simple open holographic system. In particular, we determine the energy transmission coefficient across the boundary, discover a novel duality relating weak and strong coupling to the external bath, and quantify the dissipation in the system by working out the quasi normal modes.</description>

      <title>Degenerate kinks and kink-instantons in two-dimensional scalar field models with $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models with classically degenerate vacua often support quasiclassical configurations of nontrivial topology. In (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanics with a double-well potential, for example, instantons induce mixing between the two perturbative ground states in the purely bosonic case, while in the supersymmetric version, the tunneling amplitude is suppressed.
  In this work, we investigate (1+1)-dimensional models featuring classically Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield saturated kinks with degenerate masses and identical topology. Recent studies suggest that such kinks may undergo mixing mediated by scalar-field instantons. We analyze this phenomenon in a supersymmetric framework and demonstrate that, whereas mixing indeed occurs in the bosonic theory, the presence of fermionic zero modes in the supersymmetric case leads to the vanishing of the transition amplitude. To illustrate these results, we examine two examples featuring Wess-Zumino models with two and four supercharges. The latter example is motivated by the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. We also present a number of developments of instanton calculus in the case of instantons in kink backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Towards a holographic description of closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study baby closed universes in AdS, focusing on the Antonini-Sasieta-Swingle (AS$^2$) cosmology, which arises in the gravitational description of partially entangled thermal states (PETS), as well as the classical example of Maldacena-Maoz (MM). We show that the algebraic formulation of AdS/CFT--and in particular the subregion-subalgebra duality--provides a natural framework for describing such universes within the standard AdS/CFT setting, phrased in terms of an operator algebra ${\cal M}$ and a state $\omega$ on that algebra, with no need to introduce observers. The algebra encodes all physical operations in the closed universe, and, in principle, all physical observables are obtainable from the pair $({\cal M},\omega)$. Along the way, we propose a resolution to a puzzle raised by Antonini and Rath (AR) and reinforced by recent arguments of Engelhardt and Gesteau and a no-go theorem of Gesteau: that a semiclassical baby universe in the AS$^2$ cosmology cannot be understood from the boundary in the usual manner. Our analysis motivates an averaged large-$N$ limit as part of the AdS/CFT dictionary and points toward a unified treatment of spacetimes of all asymptotics in terms of operator algebras. Finally, our boundary descriptions of closed universes indicate that for small but finite $G_N$ there should exist a semiclassical description of a macroscopic closed universe, rather than a one-dimensional Hilbert space, and we discuss weaknesses in arguments favoring the latter.</description>

      <title>Higher-Point Correlators in N=4 SYM: Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct generating functions of five- and six-point correlators up to two loops at weak 't Hooft coupling in planar N=4 SYM. These generating functions unify the correlators of the lightest scalar operator in the stress-tensor multiplet with those of all higher R-charge single-trace half-BPS scalar operators, thereby extending previous results for four-point loop integrands. At the integrated level, they are represented as sums of conformal integrals with coefficients exhibiting ten-dimensional poles that combine spacetime and R-charge distances. Our results show that higher-order poles are captured by products of lower-point generating functions. We also extract new OPE data on spinning structure constants, and compare these to integrability-based computations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>A no-go theorem for large $N$ closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under conservative assumptions, it is established at a mathematical level of rigor that if correlation functions of single trace operators in a sequence of states of $O(N^0)$ energy of a two-sided holographic conformal field theory admit a large $N$ limit, then they must be described a pure state in the large $N$ Hilbert space of free field theory on two copies of vacuum AdS. This result clarifies recent discussions concerning the possible emergence of a semiclassical baby universe in the large $N$ limit of a low-energy partially entangled thermal state. The proof heavily relies on dominated convergence arguments from mathematical analysis. Some comments are also offered on the relationship between various recently proposed ways of restoring the emergence of the baby universe and the relaxation of different assumptions of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>On non-linear chiral 4-form theories in D=10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider properties of non-linear theories of a chiral 4-form gauge field $A_4$ in ten space-time dimensions with an emphasis on a subclass of these theories which are invariant under the $D = 10$ conformal symmetry. We show that general results regarding a peculiar structure of duality-invariant abelian gauge theories in four and six space-time dimensions do not extend to non-linear chiral 4-form theories in ten dimensions. This discrepancy arises primarily from the large number 81 of independent invariants constructible from the self-dual part of the five-form field strength $F_5=dA_4$ in $D=10$, in stark contrast to the single independent (fourth-order) invariants which are building blocks of the actions in the lower dimensional cases. In particular, unlike the $D=4$ and $D=6$ cases, where non-linear duality-invariant theories can be viewed as stress-tensor ($T\overline T$-like) deformations of seed theories, the flow equations in $D=10$ generally involve both stress-tensor invariants and additional higher-order structures constructed from $F_5$. In passing, we prove the equivalence of three Lagrangian formulations of non-linear duality-invariant $p$-form theories: the PST, the Ivanov-Nurmagambetov-Zupnik and the ``clone" one.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible Chiral Symmetry and Axions under Electromagnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of non-invertible chiral symmetry in a four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory coupled to massless fermions with electromagnetic $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality. This is done by deriving the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of massless QED in the dual frame that is used to explicitly construct the symmetry defect operator as well as the conserved two-form symmetry current. As expected, the non-invertible chiral symmetry is covariant under the duality transformation. This has implications for understanding the nature of kinetic and topological terms in the dual frame and for axion electrodynamics. In particular, we show that to generate an axion potential from a dyon loop, the one-form magnetic symmetry must be explicitly broken by a mutually non-local charged state with nonzero pairwise helicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate new boundary conditions in three-dimensional asymptotically Anti-de Sitter gravity coupled to higher-spin fields, allowing for arbitrary boundary degrees of freedom. This generalization gives rise to an enlarged algebra of asymptotic charges and predicts novel anomalies in the dual field theory, whose physical origin is traced to corner ambiguities in the symplectic structure. We also prescribe a smooth flat limit, thereby extending these anomalous higher-spin effects to asymptotically flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Free-field construction of Carrollian $W_N$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Carrollian contractions of $W_N$-algebras from a free-field perspective. Using a contraction of the Miura transformation, we obtain explicit free-field realizations of the resulting Carrollian $W_N$-algebras. At the classical level, they are isomorphic to the Galilean $W_N$-algebras. In the quantum case, we distinguish between two Carrollian constructions: a flipped Carrollian contraction, where the time direction is reversed in one sector, and a symmetric contraction. The flipped construction yields a quantum algebra isomorphic to the Galilean one, whereas the symmetric construction produces a distinct quantum Carrollian $W_N$-algebra whose basic structure constants are identical to those of the classical Carrollian $W_N$-algebra. These algebras provide a natural framework for studying extended symmetries in Carrollian conformal field theories, motivated by recent developments in flat space holography. Our construction provides tools for developing the representation theory of Carrollian (and Galilean) $W_N$-algebras using free-field techniques.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potentials in Schr\"odinger field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in Schr\"odinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an embedding of the symTFT construction in (finite cut-off) holography. The proposal passes several non-trivial consistency checks reproducing the expected symTFTs in various cases, including the recently discussed symTFT for the 1-form symmetry of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Moreover, we comment on the possibility of unifying the symTFT and the symTh descriptions via the democratic formulation of Supergravity, using the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed the perturbative Fock state of the Yang-Mills BV-multiplet in the vertex operator algebra of the path-integral for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric world line and evaluate the pull-back of the latter to an integral form on supermoduli space. Choosing a suitable Poincar\'e dual on the latter, we show that this integral form describes an extension of Yang-Mills theory. Upon projection back to the Fock space, we recover the Yang-Mills action from the world line. This furthermore gives an a priori justification for the construction of Yang-Mills equations of motion as emerging from deformations of the BRST differential.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity for Open Quantum System: Dissipation and Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity in open quantum systems using Lindblad master equations for bosonic bath models, with particular emphasis on the Caldeira--Leggett model. Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the two-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the damped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in Krylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature limit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and reproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is suppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is suppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory dynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However, Krylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear distinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov complexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the conventional basis typically used to study decoherence.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic critical points from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of generic 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) holographic theories with exponential couplings. We find and classify exact, analytic, anisotropic solutions, both zero-temperature vacua and finite-temperature black brane backgrounds, with anisotropy sourced by scalar axions, magnetic fields, and charge densities, that can be interpreted as IR fixed points of renormalisation-group flows from UV-conformal fixed points. The resulting backgrounds feature a hyperscaling violation exponent and up to three independent Lifshitz-like exponents, generated by an equal number of independent coupling constants in the EMDA action. We derive the holographic stress-energy tensor and the corresponding equation of state, and discuss the behavior of the anisotropic speed of sound and butterfly velocity. We show that these theories can be consistently constrained by imposing several natural requirements, including energy conditions, thermodynamic stability, and causality. Additionally, we analyse hard probes in this class of theories, including Brownian motion, momentum broadening and jet quenching, and we demonstrate that a fully analytic treatment is possible, making their dependence on the underlying anisotropy explicit. We highlight the relevance of these models as benchmarks for strongly coupled anisotropic matter in nature, from the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions to dense QCD phases in neutron-star mergers and the cores of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Skyrmions in Holographic Quantum Chromodynamics: Topological Phases and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Tension between string amplitude prescriptions with presumed spacetime supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an alternative prescription for computing tree level scattering amplitudes in the pure spinor superstring. Proposed by Berkovits, and inspired by an earlier work by Lee and Siegel, it bypasses the traditional ghost number three measure of the pure spinor ghosts, $\langle\lambda^3 \theta^5\rangle$=1, arguably simplifying the calculation. However, direct computations using the free field OPEs of the target superspace CFT fail to reproduce the expected $\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ invariance of tree level correlators. This persistent mismatch, confirmed through independent methods, is not compatible with the gauge invariance of the amplitude. We also discuss possible implications for the B-RNS-GSS formalism of the superstring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction. The model contains an axion and a dilaton-like field. We show that while warm inflation can take place in the axion-field direction, thermal corrections coming from the radiation gauge fields, which couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different parameters, and identify a diversity of dynamical behaviors allowed in this model, denoting different regimes of warm inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: James Burkett Hartle was a theoretical physicist who made major contributions to our understanding of relativistic stars, black holes, and cosmology. Most of his career, however, was devoted to studying the universe as a quantum system. As a result, he was known as the father of quantum cosmology. He is best known for two seminal papers with Stephen Hawking that introduced two quantum states of fundamental importance: the "Hartle-Hawking vacuum" for matter fields outside a black hole, and the "no-boundary wave function of the universe" for cosmology. Jim (as everyone called him) was a warm and caring person who was genuinely concerned with the success of his students, postdocs, and colleagues. He was generous with his time and helped to foster a culture of a welcoming family among gravitational physicists.</description>

      <title>An improved formula for Wigner function and spin polarization in a decoupling relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an upgraded formula for Wigner function and spin polarization of fermions emitted by a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the decoupling which improves the one obtained in refs. [1, 2] and used in numerical simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Charting GLOBs in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the gravitational effective action provides a direct route to charting the landscape of admissible black hole spacetimes and their alternatives, which we will collectively call "gravitationally localized objects" (GLOBs). In this work, we provide a proof of principle of this idea within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. Focusing on the Einstein-Weyl truncation, we identify the unique ultraviolet-complete trajectory emanating from the asymptotically safe fixed point and use it to extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term. This allows us to chart the corresponding GLOBs in a "phase diagram", showing that wormholes dominate a large portion of it, whereas the classical Bachian naked singularities become disfavored. Our results illustrate how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes, yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a single alternative to classical black holes.</description>

      <title>Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify pairs of (twisted) multiplicative Hitchin fibrations which are "dual" in the sense that their bases are identified and their generic fibres are dual Beilinson $1$-motives. More precisely, we match the following: (1) an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced semisimple group $G$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$; (2) a twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced and simply-connected semisimple group $G$, without factors of type $\mathsf{A}_{2\ell}$, and a diagram automorphism $\theta \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $H^\vee$ of the invariant group $H=G^\theta$; (3) two twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibrations associated with $G=\mathrm{SL}_{2\ell +1}$ and two special automophisms of order $2$ and $4$, respectively. These results are consistent with a conjecture of Elliott and Pestun (arXiv:1812.05516).</description>

      <title>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Dynamics of Spinning Pole-Dipole-Quadrupole Particles in Metric-Affine Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the Lagrangian formulation of a micro-structured spinning, dilating and shearing (deformable) test body, moving in arbitrary non-Riemannian backgrounds possessing all geometrical entities of curvature, torsion and non-metricity. We start with a Lagrangian of a generic form that depends on the particle's velocity, its material frame and its absolute derivative, and the background geometry consisting of a metric and an independent affine connection. Performing variations of the path and the material frame, we derive the equations of motion for the particle that govern the evolution of its momentum and hypermomentum in this generic background. The reported equations of motion generalize those of a spinning particle (Mathisson \cite{Mathisson:1937zz}, Papapetrou \cite{Papapetrou:1951pa}, Dixon \cite{Dixon:1974xoz}) by the inclusion of the dilation and shear (hadronic) currents of matter. Using the derived equations of motion, a generalized conserved quantity is also found. Further conserved quantities that can be obtained by appropriate supplementary conditions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Twist fields in many-body physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).</description>

      <title>Exponential quintessence with momentum coupling to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Twisted Equivariant Nonabelian Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- has remained underappreciated as a cohomology theory and has only recently received attention as a flux-quantizaton law ("Hypothesis H").
  Here we lay out a general construction of the analogue of the Chern character map on twisted equivariant non-abelian cohomology theories (with equivariantly simply-connected classifying spaces) and illustrate the construction by spelling out a twisted equivariant form of Cohomotopy as an archetypical and intriguing running example, essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model.
  We close with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of self-dual lattice gauge theories in 4d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss U(1) lattice gauge theory models based on a modified Villain formulation of the gauge action, which allows coupling to bosonic electric and magnetic matter. The formulation enjoys a duality which maps electric and magnetic sectors into each other. We propose several generalizations of the model and discuss their 't~Hooft anomalies. A particularly interesting class of theories is the one where electric and magnetic matter fields are coupled with identical actions, such that for a particular value of the gauge coupling the theory has a self-dual symmetry. The self-dual symmetry turns out to be a generator of a group which is a central extension of $\mathbb Z_4$ by the lattice translation symmetry group. The simplest case amenable to numerical simulations is the case when there is exactly one electrically and one magnetically charged boson. We discuss the phase structure of this theory and the nature of the self-dual symmetry in detail. Using a suitable worldline representation of the system we present the results of numerical simulations that support the conjectured phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03938v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approximation scheme to calculate general $n$-point $HSSA$ of open bosonic string theory. This stringy scaling loop expansion contains finite number of vacuum diagram terms at each loop order of scattering energy due to a vacuum diagram contraint and a topological graph constraint. In addition, we calculate coefficient and give the vacuum diagram representation and its Feynman rules for each term in the expansion of the $HSSA$. As an application to extending our previous calculation of $n$-point leading order stringy scaling behavior of $HSSA$, we explicitly calculate some examples of $4$-point next to leading order stringy scaling violation terms.</description>

      <title>Counting microstates of out-of-equilibrium black hole fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and count the microstates of out-of-equilibrium eternal AdS black holes in which a shell carrying an order one fraction of the black hole mass is emitted from the past horizon and re-absorbed at the future horizon. Our microstates have semiclassical interpretations in terms of matter propagating behind the horizon. We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.</description>

Abstract: How to calculate the entanglement entropy between two subsystems for a mixed state has remained an important problem. In this paper, we provide a straightforward method, namely the subtraction approach, to solve this problem for generic covariant bipartite mixed states, where time dependence is explicitly included. We further demonstrate that the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_\text{vN}$ can be calculated in a more abstract yet powerful way. Within the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and a configuration of AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondences, we show that $S_\text{vN}$ exactly matches the corresponding entanglement wedge cross section in the AdS bulk, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and may allow a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. We focus on the $i\phi^3$ cubic scalar theory, obtaining the relevant pseudo-reality conditions up to quadratic order in the coupling; a theory of two complex scalar fields with non-Hermitian mass mixing; and the latter's coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The general principle of pseudo-reality, however, is expected to contribute to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Unitarity and Locality from Hidden Zeros at One-Loop Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent investigations into the geometric structure of scattering amplitudes have revealed the surprising existence of "hidden zeros": secret kinematic loci where tree-level amplitudes in Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory, the Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), and Yang-Mills theory vanish. In this Letter, we propose the extension of hidden zeros to one-loop-order in Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory and the NLSM using the "surface integrand" technology introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of locality, one-loop integrands in Tr$(\phi^3)$ are unitary if and only if they satisfy these loop hidden zeros. We also present strong evidence that the hidden zeros themselves contain the constraints from locality, leading us to conjecture that the one-loop Tr$(\phi^3)$ integrand can be fixed by hidden zeros from a generically non-local, non-unitary ansatz. Near the one-loop zeros, we uncover a simple factorization behavior and conjecture that NLSM integrands are fixed by this property, also assuming neither locality nor unitarity. This work represents the first extension of such uniqueness results to loop integrands, demonstrating that locality and unitarity emerge from other principles even beyond leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.</description>

Abstract: What do the typical entangled states of two black holes look like? Do they contain semiclassical interiors? We approach these questions constructively, providing ensembles of states which densely explore the black hole Hilbert space. The states contain very long Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: semiclassical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities. Distinguishing these ensembles from the typical entangled states of the black holes is hard. We quantify this by deriving the correspondence between a microscopic notion of quantum randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole. This formalizes a ``complexity = geometry'' relation.</description>

Abstract: In holography, the boundary entanglement structure is believed to be encoded in the bulk geometry. In this work, we investigate the precise correspondence between the boundary real-space entanglement and the bulk geometry. By the boundary real-space entanglement, we refer to the conditional mutual information (CMI) for two infinitesimal subsystems separated by a distance $l$, and the corresponding bulk geometry is at a radial position $z_*$, namely the turning point of the entanglement wedge for a boundary region with a length scale $l$. In a generic geometry described by a given coordinate system, $z_*$ can be determined locally by $l$, while the exact expression for $z_*(l)$ depends on the gauge choice, reflecting the inherent nonlocality of this seemingly local correspondence. We propose to specify the function $z_*(l)$ as the criterion for a gauge choice, and with the specified gauge function, we verify the exact correspondence between the boundary real-space entanglement and the bulk geometry. Inspired by this correspondence, we propose a new method of bulk metric reconstruction from boundary entanglement data, namely the CMI reconstruction. In this CMI proposal, with the gauge fixed a priori by specifying $z_*(l)$, the bulk metric can be reconstructed from the relation between the bulk geometry and the boundary CMI. The CMI reconstruction method establishes a connection between the differential entropy prescription and Bilson's general algorithm for metric reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the essential renormalization group equation, in which inessential couplings are removed via field redefinitions, for Einstein gravity coupled to a massive scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that perturbatively nonrenormalizable terms can be eliminated due to the cosmological term, in contrast to the case of perturbation around flat spacetime. We find a nontrivial fixed point for the Newton coupling and the cosmological term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instanton saddles proposed by Hern\'andez-Cuenca, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why similar one-eigenvalue instanton saddles cannot be used to compute the quenched entropy due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit. Our results show how to use the gravitational path integral to prove that black holes in JT gravity have isolated ground states and to study their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for slab like regions in quantum field theories, using their holographic duals. We focus on the transition between space like and time like separations. By considering boosted subsystems in conformal and confining holographic backgrounds, we identify two classes of extremal surfaces: real ones (Type I) and complex surfaces (Type II). These interpolate between the usual Ryu Takayanagi prescription and its time like generalisations. We derive explicit expressions for the entanglement entropy in both conformal and confining cases. We discuss their behaviour across phase transitions and null limits. The interpolation between Type I and Type II surfaces reveals an analytic continuation of the extremal surface across the light cone. Our analysis also finds the existence of a Ryu Takayanagi surface (Type I) even for time like separations in the confining field theory case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new particle model that describes the dynamics of a $4D,$ $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ continuous spin particle in $AdS_4$ superspace and is a generalization of the continuous-spin superparticle model in flat $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace proposed in 2506.19709 [hep-th]. The model is described by $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace coordinates together with commuting spinor additional variables, which are inherent ingredients of continuous spin models. The Lagrangian and the system of four bosonic and four fermionic phase space constraints are derived. The consistency condition for constraints imposes a restriction on supergeometry to be $AdS$ superpace. It is shown that the bosonic constraints are first-class constraints. A covariant procedure based on the use of additional variables is developed to divide the four fermionic constraints into first and second classes. It is proved that, unlike the flat case, only one fermionic constraint is a first-class constraint, while the other three are second-class constraints. In the flat limit, one of these second-class constraints becomes a first-class one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that AdS$_3$ gravity with conformal boundary conditions is described by coupling the holographic CFT to timelike Liouville theory and deforming by an exactly marginal operator. In this description, the Liouville field controls the finite-cutoff radial wall in the bulk. We check this proposal in the semiclassical limit by matching the sphere and torus partition functions between the bulk and boundary theories. By scaling parameters of the Liouville theory we can push our bulk description deep inside the interior of black hole geometries. The same scaling of parameters leads to a flat-space limit with a two-dimensional CFT as its holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid in the lowest Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

Abstract: Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall. In contrast, the early Universe plasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we consider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the effects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the running of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to mix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe. Given the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter larger than $\sim 10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce the correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers are emerging technologies expected to become important tools for exploring various aspects of fundamental physics in the future. Therefore, we pose the question of whether quantum computers can help us to study the Page curve and the black hole information dynamics, which has been a key focus in fundamental physics. In this regard, we rigorously examine the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation on IBM's superconducting quantum computers, to shed light on this question. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in this model. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques into our challenging implementation of entanglement entropy measurement protocols on the IBM quantum hardware, we accurately determine the R\'enyi entropy in the qubit transport model, thus showcasing the utility of quantum computers for future investigations of complex quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.</description>

      <title>Dip and non-linearity in the curvature perturbation from inflation with a transient non-slow-roll stage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated. As a byproduct, we find an explicit formula for the relative entropy of gauge invariant quasi-free states.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession, and multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail at one loop, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where the one-loop structure is connected to existing literature based on current algebra techniques. We further identify the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ isospin breaking correction from the intranuclear Coulomb field as arising from two-loop diagrams. We comment on future applications of our results to the radiative corrections necessary in extractions of $|V_{ud}|$, in particular for corrections that required beyond one-loop order.</description>
