      <title>Implementing agile healthcare frame works in the context of low income countries: Proposed Framework and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agile healthcare frameworks, derived from methodologies in IT and manufacturing, offer transformative potential for low-income regions. This study explores Agile integration in resource-constrained environments, focusing on Ghana. Key benefits include adaptability, iterative planning, and stakeholder collaboration to address infrastructure gaps, workforce shortages, and the "know-do gap." Digital tools like mobile health (mHealth) applications and the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS) demonstrate Agile scalability and efficacy in improving outcomes and resource allocation. Policy alignment, such as through Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), is crucial for sustaining these practices. Findings reveal Agile ability to enable real-time decision-making, foster community engagement, and drive interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper provides actionable strategies and systemic innovations, positioning Agile as a scalable model for equitable, high-quality care delivery in other low-income regions.</description>

      <title>In Situ Optimization of an Optoelectronic Reservoir Computer with Digital Delayed Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Standalone FPGA-Based QAOA Emulator for Weighted-MaxCut on Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing QC emulation is crucial for advancing QC applications, especially given the scalability constraints of current devices. FPGA-based designs offer an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional large-scale platforms, but most are tightly integrated with high-performance systems, limiting their use in mobile and edge environments. This study introduces a compact, standalone FPGA-based QC emulator designed for embedded systems, leveraging the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the Weighted-MaxCut problem. By restructuring QAOA operations for hardware compatibility, the proposed design reduces time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N), where N equals 2^n for n qubits. This reduction, coupled with a pipeline architecture, significantly minimizes resource consumption, enabling support for up to nine qubits on mid-tier FPGAs, roughly three times more than comparable designs. Additionally, the emulator achieved energy savings ranging from 1.53 times for two-qubit configurations to up to 852 times for nine-qubit configurations, compared to software-based QAOA on embedded processors. These results highlight the practical scalability and resource efficiency of the proposed design, providing a robust foundation for QC emulation in resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Beam Sweeping for AoA Estimation with an RIS Prototype: Indoor/Outdoor Field Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication systems by enabling dynamic control over the propagation environment. However, practical experiments are crucial towards the validation of the theoretical potential of RISs while establishing their real-world applicability, especially since most studies rely on simplified models and lack comprehensive field trials. In this paper, we present an efficient method for configuring a $1$-bit RIS prototype at sub-$6$ GHz, resulting in a codebook oriented for beam sweeping; an essential protocol for initial access and Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation. The measured radiation patterns of the RIS validate the theoretical model, demonstrating consistency between the experimental results and the predicted beamforming behavior. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that RIS can alter channel properties and by harnessing the diversity it provides, we evaluate beam sweeping as an AoA estimation technique. Finally, we investigate the frequency selectivity of the RIS and propose an approach to address indoor challenges by leveraging the geometry of environment.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large Full Duplex MIMO for Simultaneous Downlink Communications and Monostatic Sensing at Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-band Full Duplex (FD) technology is lately gaining attention as an enabler for the emerging paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), which envisions seamless integration of sensing mechanisms for unconnected entities into next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we present an FD Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with extremely large antenna arrays at its transceiver module, which is optimized, considering two emerging analog beamforming architectures, for simultaneous DownLink (DL) communications and monostatic-type sensing intended at the sub-THz frequencies, with the latter operation relying on received reflections of the transmitted information-bearing signals. A novel optimization framework for the joint design of the analog and digital transmit beamforming, analog receive combining, and the digital canceler for the self-interference signal is devised with the objective to maximize the achievable DL rate, while meeting a predefined threshold for the position error bound for the unknown three-dimensional parameters of a passive target. Capitalizing on the distinctive features of the beamforming architectures with fully-connected networks of phase shifters and partially-connected arrays of metamaterials, two ISAC designs are presented. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of both proposed designs over state-of-the-art schemes, highlighting the role of various system parameters in the trade-off between the communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>"Business on WhatsApp is tough now- but am I really a businesswoman?" Exploring Challenges with Adapting to Changes in WhatsApp Business</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how WhatsApp has evolved from a personal communication tool to a professional platform, focusing on its use by small business owners in India. Initially embraced in smaller, rural communities for its ease of use and familiarity, WhatsApp played a crucial role in local economies. However, as Meta introduced WhatsApp Business with new, formalized features, users encountered challenges in adapting to the more complex and costly platform. Interviews with 14 small business owners revealed that while they adapted creatively, they felt marginalized by the advanced tools. This research contributes to HCI literature by exploring the transition from personal to professional use and introduces the concept of Coercive Professionalization. It highlights how standardization by large tech companies affects marginalized users, exacerbating power imbalances and reinforcing digital colonialism, concluding with design implications for supporting community-based appropriations.</description>

      <title>Circuit Partitioning and Full Circuit Execution: A Comparative Study of GPU-Based Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executing large quantum circuits is not feasible using the currently available NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices. The high costs of using real quantum devices make it further challenging to research and develop quantum algorithms. As a result, performing classical simulations is usually the preferred method for researching and validating large-scale quantum algorithms. However, these simulations require a huge amount of resources, as each additional qubit exponentially increases the computational space required.
  Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) is a promising alternative to reduce the resources required for simulating large quantum algorithms at the cost of increased runtime. This study presents a comparative analysis of two simulation methods: circuit-splitting and full-circuit execution using distributed memory, each having a different type of overhead.
  The first method, using CutQC, cuts the circuit into smaller subcircuits and allows us to simulate a large quantum circuit on smaller machines. The second method, using Qiskit-Aer-GPU, distributes the computational space across a distributed memory system to simulate the entire quantum circuit. Results indicate that full-circuit executions are faster than circuit-splitting for simulations performed on a single node. However, circuit-splitting simulations show promising results in specific scenarios as the number of qubits is scaled.</description>

      <title>Toward Metaphor-Fluid Conversation Design for Voice User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Flutter based Multi-platform Docker Controller App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on developing a Flutter application for controlling Docker resources remotely. The application provides a user-friendly interface for executing various Docker-related commands on the server where the Docker engine is installed. The application uses the SSH protocol to establish a secure connection with the server and execute the commands. Further, an alternative approach is also explored, which involves connecting the application with the Docker engine using HTTP. This proposed Docker controller application provides a significant advantage for managing Docker resources remotely, which is highly beneficial in DevOps fields. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage containers, making it easy to create, start, stop, restart, and remove containers. It abstracts away the complexities of working with Docker commands, allowing users to interact with containers more intuitively. It can be used to manage a number of docker engines from one place making it easy to control and monitor all the docker resources. Its performance, security, and scalability are evaluated using various testing techniques, and the results are found satisfactory. Further improvements may include enhancing the application's features, optimizing the performance, and exploring other possible approaches for establishing the connection between the application and the Docker engine.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Control Landscape and Solution Space Complexity through Dimensionality Reduction &amp; Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum control landscape (QCL) is important for designing effective quantum control strategies. In this study, we analyze the QCL for a single two-level quantum system (qubit) using various control strategies. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to visualize and analyze the QCL for higher dimensional control parameters. Our results indicate that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, can play an important role in understanding the complex nature of quantum control in higher dimensions. Evaluations of traditional control techniques and machine learning algorithms reveal that Genetic Algorithms (GA) outperform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), while Q-learning (QL) shows great promise compared to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Additionally, our experiments highlight the importance of reward function design in DQN and PPO demonstrating that using immediate reward results in improved performance rather than delayed rewards for systems with short time steps. A study of solution space complexity was conducted by using Cluster Density Index (CDI) as a key metric for analyzing the density of optimal solutions in the landscape. The CDI reflects cluster quality and helps determine whether a given algorithm generates regions of high fidelity or not. Our results provide insights into effective quantum control strategies, emphasizing the significance of parameter selection and algorithm optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.</description>

      <title>Relational Norms for Human-AI Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How we should design and interact with social artificial intelligence depends on the socio-relational role the AI is meant to emulate or occupy. In human society, relationships such as teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors, siblings, or employer-employee are governed by specific norms that prescribe or proscribe cooperative functions including hierarchy, care, transaction, and mating. These norms shape our judgments of what is appropriate for each partner. For example, workplace norms may allow a boss to give orders to an employee, but not vice versa, reflecting hierarchical and transactional expectations. As AI agents and chatbots powered by large language models are increasingly designed to serve roles analogous to human positions - such as assistant, mental health provider, tutor, or romantic partner - it is imperative to examine whether and how human relational norms should extend to human-AI interactions. Our analysis explores how differences between AI systems and humans, such as the absence of conscious experience and immunity to fatigue, may affect an AI's capacity to fulfill relationship-specific functions and adhere to corresponding norms. This analysis, which is a collaborative effort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and AI researchers, carries important implications for AI systems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that AI systems can offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency in certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy dependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human relationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or implementing) suitable human-AI relational norms will be crucial for ensuring that human-AI interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human well-being.</description>

Abstract: Honeypots, as a strategic cyber-deception mechanism designed to emulate authentic interactions and bait unauthorized entities, often struggle with balancing flexibility, interaction depth, and deception. They typically fail to adapt to evolving attacker tactics, with limited engagement and information gathering. Fortunately, the emergent capabilities of large language models and innovative prompt-based engineering offer a transformative shift in honeypot technologies. This paper introduces HoneyGPT, a pioneering shell honeypot architecture based on ChatGPT, characterized by its cost-effectiveness and proactive engagement. In particular, we propose a structured prompt engineering framework that incorporates chain-of-thought tactics to improve long-term memory and robust security analytics, enhancing deception and engagement. Our evaluation of HoneyGPT comprises a baseline comparison based on a collected dataset and a three-month field evaluation. The baseline comparison demonstrates HoneyGPT's remarkable ability to strike a balance among flexibility, interaction depth, and deceptive capability. The field evaluation further validates HoneyGPT's superior performance in engaging attackers more deeply and capturing a wider array of novel attack vectors.</description>

      <title>Artworks Reimagined: Exploring Human-AI Co-Creation through Body Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a popular activity. However, text-to-image generation - where images are produced from typed prompts - can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of installations at public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience to the installation's visitors. We present insights into participants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.</description>
