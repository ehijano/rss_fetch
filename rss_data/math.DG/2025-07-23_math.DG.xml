      <title>On Hopf's conjecture and positive second intermediate Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf conjectured that even-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional curvature have positive Euler characteristic. The conclusion of the conjecture is known to fail if the positive sectional curvature assumption is relaxed in any number of ways, including to positive second intermediate Ricci curvature. Here we prove that if a manifold with positive second intermediate Ricci curvature has dimension divisible by four and torus symmetry of rank at least ten, then it has positive Euler characteristic. A crucial new tool is a non-trivial extension of the first author's Four Periodicity Theorem to situations where the periodicity of the cohomology does not extend all the way down to degree zero.</description>

      <title>The Alpha Group Tensorial Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alpha Group is an abstract geometry group in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The way it was conceived allows a new interpretation of the structure of hypercomplex space, with a new geometry and spatial topology, and a meaning for the geometric representation of $\mathbb{R}^4$ space to infinity. Therefore, it has been described as the tensorial metric formula in the Alpha Group. It will be shown that the Riemannian and Euclidean distance metrics between infinitesimal surfaces are represented as special cases of the metric of the Alpha Group.</description>

      <title>Convexity and the degenerate special Lagrangian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015 Rubinstein--Solomon introduced the degenerate special Lagrangian equation (DSL) that governs geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians, showed that subsolutions in the top branch of DSL are convex in space, and raised the question of whether they should be convex in space-time and whether subsolutions in the second branch possess any convexity properties. In 2019, Darvas--Rubinstein gave a partial answer to the first problem by showing subsolutions in the top branch must be bi-convex. We settle both questions. The key new ingredient is a space-time coordinate transformation that preserves the space-time Lagrangian angle and allows for a partial $C^2$ estimate. This also shows that the top two branches of the DSL subequation have a $\star$-product structure in the sense of Ross--Witt-Nystr\"om.</description>

      <title>Convergence of discrete conformal mappings on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete conformal mappings based on circle packing, vertex scaling, and related structures has had significant activity since Thurston proposed circle packing as a way to approximate conformal maps in the 1980s. The first convergence result of Rodin-Sullivan (1987) proved that circle packing maps do indeed converge to conformal maps to the disk. Recent results have shown convergence of maps of other discrete conformal structures to conformal maps as well. We give a general theorem of convergence of discrete conformal mappings between surfaces that allows for a variety of discrete conformal structures and manifolds with or without boundary. The mappings are a composition of piecewise linear discrete conformal mappings and Riemannian barycentric coordinates, called barycentric discrete conformal maps. Estimates of the barycentric discrete conformal maps allow extraction of convergent subsequences and estimates for the pullback of the Riemannian metric, proving conformality. The theorem requires assumptions on fullness of simplices to prevent degenerate triangles and a local discrete conformal rigidity generalizing hexagonal rigidity of circle packings.</description>

      <title>On rigidity of hypersurfaces with constant shifted curvature functions in warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give some new characterizations of umbilic hypersurfaces in general warped product manifolds, which can be viewed as generalizations of the work in \cite{KLP18} and \cite{WX14}. Firstly, we prove the rigidity for hypersurfaces with constant linear combinations of shifted higher order mean curvatures. Using integral inequalities and Minkowski-type formulas, we then derive rigidity theorems in sub-static warped product manifolds, including cases that the hypersurface satisfies some nonlinear curvature conditions. Finally, we show that our results can be applied to more general warped product manifolds, including the cases with non-constant sectional curvature fiber.</description>

      <title>Lines in the space of K\"ahler metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence for weak geodesic lines in the (completed) space of K\"ahler metrics. We construct a wide range of weak geodesic lines on arbitrary projective K\"ahler manifolds that are not generated by holomorphic vector fields, thus disproving a folklore conjecture popularized by Berndtsson. Remarkably, some of these weak geodesic lines turn out to be smooth. In the case of Riemann surfaces, our results can be significantly sharpened. Finally, we investigate the validity of Euclid's fifth postulate for the space of K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>On Weyl structures reducible in the direction of the Lee form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Weyl structure on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is a torsion-free linear connection $\nabla$ such that there is a $1$-form $\theta$ (called the Lee form) satisfying $\nabla g = 2\, \theta \otimes g$. We examine the case in which there exists a $\nabla$-parallel distribution of codimension $1$ on which the Lee form vanishes identically. We prove that if $(M,g)$ is complete with $\theta$ closed, then the Weyl structure must be flat or exact. We apply this to show that every homogeneous Kenmotsu manifold is isometric to the real hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>The canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection and its curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a (semi-Riemannian) generalised metric $\mathcal G$ and a divergence operator $\mathrm{div}$ on an exact Courant algebroid $E$, we geometrically construct a canonical generalised Levi-Civita connection $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ for these data. In this way we provide a resolution of the problem of non-uniqueness of generalised Levi-Civita connections. Since the generalised Riemann tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ is an invariant of the pair $(\mathcal G, \mathrm{div})$, we no longer need to discard curvature components which depend on the choice of the generalised connection. As a main result we decompose the generalised Riemann curvature tensor of $D^{\mathcal G, \mathrm{div}}$ in terms of classical (non-generalised) geometric data. Based on this set of master formulas we derive a comprehensive curvature tool-kit for applications in generalised geometry. This includes decompositions for the full generalised Ricci tensor, the generalised Ricci tensor, and three generalised scalar-valued curvature invariants, two of which are new.</description>

Abstract: We study the standard tractor bundle and the standard cotractor bundle of an almost Grassmann structure: We provide explicit formulae for their splitting operators, first BGG operators as well as prolongation connections. We characterize parallel tractors and cotractors as well as the solutions of the BGG operators in standard geometric terms. Moreover, we describe the geometry canonically endowed on the zero locus of a solution of the first BGG operators.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and positivity of Hawking quasi-local energy on area-constrained critical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <title>Domain of Discontinuity of Anosov Subgroups Acting on Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$.
  When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Resolutions and Limits of Manifolds with a Uniform Contractibility Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short and self-contained proof to a 1991 conjecture by Moore concerning the structure of certain finite-dimensional Gromov--Hausdorff limits, in the ANR setting. As a consequence, one easily characterizes finite dimensional limits of PL-able or Riemannian $n$-manifolds with a uniform contractibility function. For example, one can define for any compact connected metric space that is a resolvable ANR homology manifold of covering dimension at least 5, an obstruction, which vanishes if and only if the homology manifold can be approximated in the Gromov--Hausdorff sense by PL-manifolds of the same dimension and with a uniform contractibility function. Further, it provides short proofs to certain well known results by reducing them to problems in Bing topology. We also give another proof using more classical arguments that yield more structural information. We give several applications to the theory of homology manifolds, Alexandrov spaces, Wasserstein spaces and a generalized form of the diffeomorphism stability conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Plateau's Problem for intrinsic graphs in the Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a geometric construction, we solve Plateau's Problem in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{1}$ for intrinsic graphs defined on a convex domain $D$, under a smallness condition either on the boundary $\partial D$ or on the Lipschitz boundary datum $\varphi : \partial D \to \mathbb{R}$. The proof relies on a calibration argument. We then apply these techniques to establish a new regularity result for $H$-perimeter minimizers.</description>

      <title>New geometric structures on 3-manifolds: surgery and generalized geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are analogues of symplectic and complex structures that can be defined on 3-manifolds. Their existence imposes strong topological constraints. Generalized geometry offers a natural common generalization of these two structures: $B_3$-generalized complex structures. We prove that any closed orientable 3-manifold admits such a structure, which can be chosen to be stable, that is, generically cosymplectic up to generalized diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Universal central extension of the Lie algebra of exact divergence-free vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the universal central extension of the Lie algebra of exact divergence-free vector fields, proving a conjecture by Claude Roger from 1995. The proof relies on the analysis of a Leibniz algebra that underlies these vector fields. As an application, we construct the universal central extension of the (infinite-dimensional) Lie group of exact divergence-free diffeomorphisms of a compact 3-dimensional manifold.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>Second-order superintegrable systems and Weylian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abundant second-order maximally conformally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems are re-examined, revealing their underlying natural Weyl structure and offering a clearer geometric context for the study of St\"ackel transformations (also known as coupling constant metamorphosis). This also allows us to naturally extend the concept of conformal superintegrability from the realm of conformal geometries to that of Weyl structures. It enables us to interpret superintegrable systems of the above type as semi-Weyl structures, a concept related to statistical manifolds and affine hypersurface theory.</description>

      <title>Deformation Quantization with Separation of Variables of $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a deformation quantization with separation of variables of the Grassmannian $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$. A star product on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ can be explicitly determined as the solution of the recurrence relations for $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$ given by Hara and one of the authors (A. Sako). To provide the solution to the recurrence relations, it is necessary to solve a system of linear equations in each order. However, to give a concrete expression of the general term is not simple because the variables increase with the order of the differentiation of the star product. For this reason, there has been no formula to express the general term of the recurrence relations. In this paper, we overcome this problem by transforming the recurrence relations into simpler ones. We solve the recurrence relations using creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space. From this solution, we obtain an explicit formula of a star product with separation of variables on $G_{2,4}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>General monotone formula for homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation in the exterior domain and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an overdetermined problem for the $k$-Hessian equation ($1\leq k&lt;\frac n2$) in the exterior domain and prove the corresponding ball characterizations. Since that Weinberger type approach seems to fail to solve the problem, we give a new perspective to solve exterior overdetermined problem by combining two integral identities and geometric inequalities inspired by Brandolini-Nitsch-Salani's results \cite{BNS}. Meanwhile, we establish general monotone formulas to derive geometric inequalities related to $k$-admissible solution $u$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is smooth, $k$-convex and star-shaped domain, which constructed by Ma-Zhang\cite{MZ} and Xiao\cite{xiao}.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic supergravity in ten dimensions and anomaly cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a ten-dimensional version of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau five-fold that reproduces the classical Maurer-Cartan equation governing supersymmetric heterotic moduli. Quantising this theory's quadratic fluctuations, we show that its one-loop partition function simplifies to products of holomorphic Ray-Singer torsions and exhibits an anomaly that factorises as in $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ supergravity. Based on this, we conjecture that this theory is the $SU(5)$-twisted version of ten-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to Yang-Mills and show that is related to the type I Kodaira-Spencer theory of Costello-Li via a non-local field redefinition. The counter-terms needed to cancel the anomaly and retain gauge invariance for the one-loop effective theory reconstruct the differential of a recently discovered double-extension complex. This complex has non-tensorial extension classes and its first cohomology counts the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic compactifications modulo order $\alpha'^2$ corrections.</description>
