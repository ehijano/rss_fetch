      <title>Score Matching on Large Geometric Graphs for Cosmology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to $N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000 halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.</description>

      <title>Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>High-$z$ SMBHs in Cosmological Models with Enhanced Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact of non-power-law spectra of matter perturbations with a bump or with a blue tilt at small scales on the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located the innermost part of galaxies. We study SMBH's mass growth rate and the epochs of their birth in four cosmological models using N-body simulations of dark matter within the box of $(100$~Mpc$/h)^3$. The simulations were populated with SMBHs using TRINITY semi-analytic model. We found that the most massive SMBHs at the redshifts $z=5-6$ are similar in all considered cosmologies, including the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. At larger $z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\Lambda$CDM model) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring super-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at $z\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\Lambda$CMD model.</description>

      <title>RedMaPPer Cluster Properties from Two-Dimensional Lensing Shear Maps in the HSC-SSP Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter halos are fundamental cosmological structures whose properties-such as concentration, ellipticity, and mass centroid-encode information about their formation and evolution. Concentration traces collapse time and internal structure, while ellipticity and centroid offsets reflect halo shape and dynamical state. Accurate characterization of these properties improves mass estimates and tests dark matter models. Gravitational lensing, which directly probes projected mass distributions, provides a powerful means to constrain halo structure. We present a 2D weak-lensing analysis of 299 RedMaPPer clusters using shear measurements from the HSC-SSP first-year data release. By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer cluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the mass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The derived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than traditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely with the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and lower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more spherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by e=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of &lt;e&gt;=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a bimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids: some halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while others show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D weak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs for understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Dual axion-like field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is one of the most important paradigms in modern cosmology. In its simplest form, inflation is driven by a single inflaton field. However, multi-field inflation has become increasingly attractive because it can solve many theoretical and observational challenges. In this paper, we propose a particular model involving two axion-like fields with simply monodromy-dominated potentials. We demonstrate that this model is consistent with current cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected $\phi^{4}$ Inflation in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby placing conventional attractor-type inflationary models such as Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation under increasing tension at the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ level. In this work, we examine quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Introducing an anomalous scaling parameter $\gamma$ to capture quantum corrections to the effective potential, we derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$. Confronting these predictions with ACT, Planck, and BAO+lensing constraints, we demonstrate that modest values of $\gamma$ can raise $n_s$ into the ACT-preferred range while maintaining a strongly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio. For instance, with $N=60$ and $\gamma\simeq 0.006$, the model predicts $n_s\simeq 0.974$ and $r\simeq 0.007$, in excellent agreement with current bounds. We further investigate preheating dynamics, focusing on particle production via parametric resonance in quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this scenario, the inflaton $\phi$ couples to an additional scalar $\chi$ through an interaction $g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}$. In Minkowski spacetime, the resonance dynamics reduce to the Mathieu equation, and we find that broad resonance can be readily achieved, leading to efficient particle production.</description>

      <title>A Unified Lagrangian Framework for Galaxy Clustering: Consistent Modeling of Bias, Redshift-Space Distortions, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \emph{Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory} (ULPT), a perturbative framework for consistently modeling galaxy density fluctuations across real space, redshift space, and post-reconstruction fields. Unlike existing approaches that treat these cases separately, ULPT provides a single theoretical structure that incorporates the three essential coordinate mappings: the Lagrangian-to-Eulerian transformation, the real-to-redshift mapping induced by peculiar velocities, and the remapping from pre to post reconstruction. A key feature of our formulation is the explicit decomposition of the density field into two physically distinct components: the \emph{Jacobian deviation}, which encodes intrinsic linear and nonlinear growth, and the \emph{displacement-mapping effect}, which captures large-scale convective distortions. This separation enables a fully analytic and infrared (IR)-safe resummation, ensuring exact IR cancellation, a consistent Gaussian description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping, and the correct residual structure in cross spectra between fields with distinct IR behavior. The perturbative expansion of ULPT naturally generates Galileon-type operators, thereby providing a compact and physically motivated operator basis for nonlinear and nonlocal Lagrangian bias, and allowing for a renormalization-free treatment of biased tracers. Within this framework, we derive a unified expression for the power spectrum that applies equally to dark matter, biased tracers, redshift-space distortions, and reconstructed fields. ULPT thus offers a robust and extensible foundation for precision modeling of large-scale structure, with potential extensions to higher-order statistics, such as the bispectrum, and to other two-point observables, such as galaxy--galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>

      <title>Constraining deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged)We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario. The specific form of this model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\delta(z)$: model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational data, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the SH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which the deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\sigma$ deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\sigma$ once SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ and reaching $3\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike Information Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction-a conclusion that aligns with various studies on dark energy, wherein dynamic dark energy is often favored over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Dark Degeneracy in DESI DR2: Interacting or Evolving Dark Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</description>

      <title>Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a Rotating Black Hole in a Dehnen Galactic Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Timing Mass of the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Addressing Dipole Tension via Clustering in $\Lambda$CDM and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is typically attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole, helping to confirm the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. However, numerous studies of the large-scale structure dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the cosmic large-scale structure distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering dipole and the kinematic dipole. We also determine whether these outcomes help reconcile previous measurements of the NVSS dipole with predictions based on the CMB. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on large scales might be intrinsically anisotropic. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic anisotropy and calculate the clustering for this model. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of modified gravity theories, specifically the $f(R)$ gravity model. By examining this model, it is possible to gain a better understanding of how the cosmic dark energy component affects the dipole. Finally, by comparing these two models, we can see that the $f(R)$ model predicts a higher clustering dipole compared to the standard cosmological model, which explains the discrepancy between the kinetic and clustering dipoles and leads to a higher dipole amplitude.</description>

      <title>Big Bang as spacetime defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-Big-Bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to Symmetron Fifth-Force Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear scalar-tensor theories of gravity have been considered as candidates for dark matter and dark energy. Often, they possess screening mechanisms which allow the fifth force mediated by the additional scalar degree(s) of freedom to evade detection from local experiments. Their classical behaviour is well studied, but their quantum nature is relatively unexplored. We outline a Green's function method for obtaining the leading-order quantum corrections to the classical symmetron field profile in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric extended source. For parameters that experiments had previously ruled out, our calculations indicate that the symmetron force may be weaker than the classical field suggests.</description>

      <title>Linear map-making with LuSEE-Night</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.</description>

Abstract: We review the cosmic generalisation of the virial theorem known as the Layzer-Irvine equation, also independently derived by Dmitriev and Zeldovich. This equation has been studied in the literature for dark matter-dark energy interaction models, as well as in the context of alternative theories of gravity. We discuss results from the previous scenarios and point out future directions.</description>

      <title>Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptophobic Dark Sectors via Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a minimally extended version of the Standard Model where baryon number is gauged with a $U(1)_B$ symmetry. This model can be made anomaly-free by adding a set of additional fermions. The lightest component of these fermions behaves as a viable dark matter candidate. We show that the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ symmetry can produce gravitational waves via bubble dynamics resulting from a first-order phase transition, which can be detected in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and ET. Such gravitational wave signatures can be used as a probe to constrain the model in future observations and complement dark matter and collider searches. We perform a random numerical scan of the parameter space and derive the viable region consistent with current bounds from dark matter experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN and XENONnT and sensitive to future gravitational wave experiments. We find that dark matter with mass of order $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ TeV is the most interesting to test in future gravitational wave as well as laboratory experiments. In the viable parameter space, the mass of the $Z'$ gauge boson associated with the $U(1)_B$ lies in the few-tens of TeV region, and the mass of the scalar associated with the symmetry breaking lies around a few hundred GeV to TeV scale. Hence, the dark matter and mediator mass scales typically fall beyond the reach of present direct detection experiments and are marginally accessible at current collider energies.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET : Kinetic, Thermal and Magnetic AGN Feedback in Massive Galaxies at Halo Masses $\sim 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r&lt;15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r&lt;1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spectrum of stochastic gravitational-wave anisotropies with pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropies in the nanohertz gravitational-wave background are a compelling next target for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Measurements or informative upper limits to the anisotropies are expected in the near future and can offer important clues about the origin of the background and the properties of the sources. Given that each source is expected (in the simplest scenario of circular inspirals) to emit at a fixed frequency, the anisotropy will most generally vary from one frequency to another. The main result presented in this work is an analytical model for the anisotropies produced by a population of inspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries (SMBHBs). This model can be immediately connected with parametrizations of the SMBHB mass function and can be easily expanded to account for new physical processes taking place within the PTA frequency band. We show that a variety of SMBHB models predict significant levels of anistropy at the highest frequencies accessible to PTA observations and that measurements of anisotropies can offer new information regarding this population beyond the isotropic component. We also model the impact of additional dynamical effects driving the binary towards merger and show that, if these processes are relevant within the PTA band, the detectability of anisotropies relative to the isotropic background will be enhanced. Finally, we use the formalism presented in this work to predict the level anisotropy of the circular and linear polarizations of the SGWB due to the distribution of binary orientation angles with respect to the line of sight.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Reconstruction of Dark Matter Velocity Fields from Redshift-Space Halo Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a UNet-based deep learning model to reconstruct the real-space dark matter (DM) velocity field from the redshift-space distribution of sparse DM halos. Using various statistical measures, we show that the reconstructed velocity components--including velocity magnitude, momentum, and divergence--closely match the ground truth, achieving better than 10% relative error and a correlation coefficient of 0.88. In the power spectrum comparison over $k \in [0.05, 0.3] h/{\rm Mpc}$, the UNet reconstruction outperforms linear theory and agrees with the true field within $2\sigma$. The model also effectively corrects redshift-space distortions (RSD), yielding unbiased power spectrum multipoles of DM fields within $2\sigma$. Notably, the UNet remains robust even with incomplete halo mass information. These results highlight the model's broad applicability to cosmological analyses, including RSD, cosmic web studies, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and BAO reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Primary Beam Chromaticity in HIRAX: I. Characterization from Simulations and Power Spectrum Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is an upcoming radio interferometric telescope designed to constrain dark energy through the 21cm intensity mapping of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instrumental systematics must be controlled and carefully characterized to measure the 21cm power spectrum with fidelity and achieve high-precision constraints on the cosmological parameters. The chromaticity of the primary beam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally smooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial and spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies the chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate measurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of chromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam modeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics that can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the primary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe and sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple foreground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the H$\textsc{i}$ power spectrum. Additionally, we find that modeling up to the octupolar azimuthal order feature (fourth-order angular variation) in the primary beam is sufficient to reduce the leakage outside the wedge with minimal bias.</description>

      <title>Deep Needlet: A CNN based full sky component separation method in Needlet space</title>

Abstract: One of the key steps in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis is component separation to recover the CMB signal from multi-frequency observations contaminated by foreground emissions. Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) is one of the successful methods that applies the minimum variance estimation technique to a set of needlet-filtered frequency maps to recover CMB. In this work, we develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recover CMB temperature map from needlet-filtered frequency maps over the full sky. The network operates on a multi-resolution representation of spherical data, capturing localised features in both pixel and harmonic space, and is designed to preserve the rotational invariance of the CMB signal.
  The network model is trained on realistic simulations at Planck frequencies, which include CMB temperature maps generated using cosmological parameters sampled within a 2$\sigma$ standard deviation around the Planck best-fit values. We demonstrate the network performance for simulations that exhibit different foreground complexities. The recovered CMB temperature map closely follows the true signal with some residual leakage near the Galactic plane. The TT power spectrum is accurately reconstructed up to multipoles of approximately $\ell\sim 1100$. A minor residual systematics remain at smaller scales. Compared to the NILC method, the network shows reduced residual foreground contamination in the recovered CMB map.
  Once validated on the simulations, the network is applied to Planck PR3 intensity data. The resulting CMB map is consistent with the CMB maps from the Planck legacy products, including those produced using the NILC and SMICA pipelines. This work demonstrates a powerful component separation method to clean spherical signal data from multi-resolution wavelet-filtered maps.</description>

      <title>DeepSSM: an emulator of gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DeepSSM, an open-source code powered by neural networks (NNs) to emulate gravitational wave (GW) spectra produced by sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions in the radiation-dominated era. The training data is obtained from an enhanced version of the Sound Shell Model (SSM), which accounts for the effects of cosmic expansion and yields more accurate spectra in the infrared regime. The emulator enables instantaneous predictions of GW spectra given the phase transition parameters, while achieving agreement with the enhanced SSM model within 10\% accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. The emulator is highly computationally efficient and fully differentiable, making it particularly suitable for direct Bayesian inference on phase transition parameters without relying on empirical templates, such as broken power-law models. We demonstrate this capability by successfully reconstructing phase transition parameters and their degeneracies from mock LISA observations using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The code is available at: https://github.com/ctian282/DeepSSM.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Constraining Statistical Isotropy using 21cm Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large length scales, typically $\gtrsim 70$Mpc. A detection of significant deviation would help us falsify the simplest models of inflation. In this regard, there are potential indications of departures from this principle, e.g., observations from WMAP and Planck show signs of a preferred direction in the temperature fluctuations known as hemispherical asymmetry in CMB. Phenomenologically, this has been studied using a dipole modulation model. In addition to this, a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain this anomaly. Some of these scenarios generate dipolar asymmetry or predict quadrupolar asymmetry in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we study both these asymmetries. To fulfill the objective, we employ 21cm intensity mapping technique post during post-reionization era, i.e., $z\lesssim 7$. We apply Fisher formalism to constrain dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy parameters using both 21cm power and bispectra and give forecasts for three intensity mapping surveys: SKA-Mid, HIRAX and PUMA. Although 21cm intensity mapping is a very promising cosmological probe, the signals are severely affected by foregrounds. To mitigate the foreground effects, we use foreground avoidance approach. For the interferometer mode of operation, we also include the wedge effect. From our analysis, we find that PUMA, on account of its high redshift range is able to constrain both dipolar and quadrupolar parameters to better than $\sim 10^{-3}$ for redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$. This is one order of magnitude better constraints as compared to those provided by the latest CMB surveys. We also find that as compared to power spectrum, the constraining power of bispectrum is more sensitive towards foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Redshift-space galaxy bispectrum in presence of massive neutrinos: A multipole expansion approach for Euclid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic structures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space, adopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \mu, t)$, that captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and numerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory kernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear triangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with deviations reaching up to $\sim 2\%$ for a total mass $\sum m_\nu = 0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like \textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual multipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The neutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable with SNR $\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting for small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and $B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed limits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit measurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases with wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles, suggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection prospects. Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum multipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional power spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information and higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Redshift Evolution of the Intrinsic Alignments of Early-Type Galaxies and Subhalos in the Horizon Run 5 Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of intrinsic alignments of the shapes of galaxies and subhalos with the large-scale structures of the universe using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, $\textit{Horizon Run 5}$. To this end, early-type galaxies are selected from the simulated galaxy catalogs based on stellar mass and kinematic morphology. The shapes of galaxies and subhalos are computed using the reduced inertia tensor derived from mass-weighted particle positions. We find that the misalignment between galaxies and their corresponding dark-matter subhalos decreases over time. We further analyze the two-point correlation between galaxy or subhalo shapes and the large-scale density field traced by their spatial distribution, and quantify the amplitude using the nonlinear alignment model across a wide redshift range from $z = 0.625$ to $z = 2.5$. We find that the intrinsic alignment amplitude, $A_{\rm NLA}$, of galaxies remains largely constant with redshift, whereas that of dark matter subhalos exhibits moderate redshift evolution, with a power-law slope that deviates from zero at a significance level exceeding $3\sigma$. Additionally, $A_{\rm NLA}$ is found to depend on both the stellar mass and kinematic morphology of galaxies. Notably, our results are broadly consistent with existing observational constraints. Our findings are in good agreement with previous results of other cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A New Wavelet Scattering Transform-Based Statistic for Cosmological Analysis of Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale structure (LSS) analysis in galaxy surveys is a powerful cosmological probe but is limited by tracer bias, which can obscure underlying information and weaken parameter constraints. Existing methods either model bias or restrict analyses to low-density regions, yet their sensitivity to bias remains poorly understood. We propose a novel method based on the wavelet scattering transform (WST) to distinguish LSS across cosmological models while mitigating tracer bias. Central to our approach are the WST $m$-mode ratios, $R^{\rm wst}$, a new statistical measure, and a high-density apodization preprocessing that smoothly rescales extreme values. We use a reduced chi-square to assess the cosmological parameter constraints and find that $R^{\rm wst}$, in the scale range $j \in [3,7]$, achieves $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm cos} \approx 6$ for cosmology while maintaining $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm bias} \sim 1$--a regime unattained by other statistics. $R^{\rm wst}$ thus provides robust cosmological sensitivity with effective bias mitigation for future surveys.</description>

      <title>Are single-field models of inflation and PBHs production ruled out by ACT observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black holes (PBHs) formation in single-field inflation models versus the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation measurements favour a {\it higher} scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its {\it positive} running $\alpha_s$, which put the single-field models under scrutiny. Even in the absence of PBHs production, the new data constrain many single-field models of inflation. To explore this tension, we study PBHs formation in a concrete viable $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the ACT bounds on the CMB observables. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ through bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$. Those values are disfavored by the ACT bounds just above $2\sigma$ even for PBHs in the asteroid-mass range, while the tension becomes stronger for heavier PBHs.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DDM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we contrast previous results with a frequentist analysis of Planck and SDSS BAO data. We find that the $68\%$ confidence level region corresponds to a decay half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$~km/s. These $1\sigma$ constraints strongly differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effect in the Bayesian analysis. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $\sim 1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial amplitude $A_s$ and spectral index $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We note that without such priors, the scales best measured by KiDS-1000 do not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, so $S_8$ constraints should not be applied directly to a model in place of the full likelihood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z&gt;15$), using four nights of observations with NenuFAR. The limits are derived from two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of 26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At $z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;4.6 \times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at $z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;5.0 \times 10^6 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivity estimates to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, predicting Hyper-K can reach spin dependent cross sections as low as $\sigma_{p\chi}^{\mathrm{SD}}=2\times 10^{-35}\mathrm{cm}^2$ for DM masses below 2 GeV. This surpasses current solar limits and direct detection results. We additionally provide estimates for Super-K ORCA, and the IceCube-Upgrade, showing that these experiments could provide complimentary bounds to direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A population study on the effect of metallicity on ZAMS to the merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of compact object binaries are crucial for interpreting gravitational wave observations and enhancing early multi-messenger alerts. Despite the key role of stellar metallicity in progenitor evolution, many models assume a uniform value for all stars in a cluster. In this study, we investigate the impact of a heterogeneous stellar metallicity distribution on the formation of compact object binaries and their resulting gravitational wave signatures. We extend the COSMIC binary population synthesis code to incorporate a fiducial mass-redshift-metallicity relation for individual Zero-Age Main Sequence stars of a stellar cluster. Focusing on low-metallicity environments at redshift $z \approx 4$, we analyse the gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes and black hole-neutron star systems in the sub-hertz regime. The resulting binary black holes have total masses from $8$-$86\,M_\odot$, while black hole--neutron star systems range from $6$-$31\,M_\odot$. We assess the detectability of the characteristic strains against the sensitivity curves of planned sub-hertz observatories.</description>

      <title>Radio-loudness statistics of quasars from Quaia-VLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasars are objects of high interest in extragalactic astrophysics, cosmology, and astrometry. One of their useful qualities is their potential radio loudness. However, the fraction of radio-loud vs. radio-quiet quasars is subject to ongoing investigations, where the statistical power is limited by the low number of known quasars with radio counterparts. In this analysis, we revisited the radio loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding the pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added quasar catalog with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes, radio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other flags, besides their sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical Quaia catalog of about 1.3 million quasars (from the Gaia data) with 1.9 million sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalog. We explored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing completeness and purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalog, and found 1.5 arcseconds a sufficient choice. Our main finding is that the quasar radio-loud fraction is in good agreement with previous works (&lt; 10%), and there is no significant large-scale sky pattern in radio loudness. The exact estimate depends on the G-band magnitude limit, and we observed weak trends with redshift and absolute optical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data. The cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalog with 43,650 sources and accompanying code are freely available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.16035690. This latest census of QSOs with radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of research.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultrahigh-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this paper, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal scenario where the SHDM decays to neutrino and SM Higgs. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass, ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits, and the observed KM3-230213A event, along with the gamma-ray constraints. We find that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on the DM mass ranging from $1.5\times10^8$ GeV to $5.2\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime in the range: $1.42\times10^{30}$ s to $5.4\times10^{29}$ s. Remarkably, in our SHDM scenario, the apparent tension between the KM3NeT observation and the nonobservation of this event by IceCube and Auger can be reduced to below $1.2\sigma$. Our results are applicable to any neutrinophilic SHDM models while evading gamma-ray constraints.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the Kerr and its several single-parameter modified spacetimes using quasi-periodic oscillation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical effects of particles moving in the Kerr spacetime and its nine single-parameter modified spacetimes, including Bardeen, Ayon-Beato and Garcia (ABG), Hayward, Kerr-Newman (KN), Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN), Braneworld Kerr (BK), Kerr-MOG, Kerr-Sen, and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) black holes. Using quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observational data, we constrain the free parameters of the ten spacetimes through $\chi^2$ analysis under the relativistic precession model of QPO. We constrain the modification parameters for the nine single-parameter modified spacetimes and provide the spin and mass ranges of three microquasars within the ten spacetime models (including Kerr) at the $68\%$ confidence level (CL). The results demonstrate that, at the $68 \%$ CL, the QPO data impose stringent constraints on the free parameters, as evidenced by the narrow confidence intervals. Among them, only the KN spacetime yields a modification parameter constraint spanning both negative and positive values (encompassing the Kerr case at zero). In contrast, all other tested geometries mandate positive-definite parameters at $68 \%$ CL, demonstrating statistical deviation of the Kerr solution. This highlights the significance of exploring modifications to the Kerr spacetime. Finally, we evaluate the spacetime models using the Bayes factor and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Based on the current QPO observational data, the Bayesian factor analysis indicates that the ABG, Hayward, KN, BK, and Kerr-MOG spacetime have a slight advantage over the Kerr solution, while the Bardeen, KTN, Kerr-Sen, and PFDM spacetime are somewhat inferior to the Kerr model. In contrast, the AIC analysis shows that the Kerr spacetime remains the optimal model under the current QPO data.</description>

Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>

Abstract: $F(R)$ inflationary models are analyzed without the Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame. Sufficient conditions for existence of global inflationary attractors in $F(R)$ models are provided. Following that, the procedure for calculating inflationary observables completely in the original, Jordan, frame is given. The described procedure is used to analyze a new $F(R)$ inflationary model (a one-parameter deformation of the Starobinsky model), which is shown to provide predictions in good agreement with the recent ACT data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>
