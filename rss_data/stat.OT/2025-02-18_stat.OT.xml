      <title>A Survey: Potential Dimensionality Reduction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11036v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data analysis, enabling efficient representation and visualization of high-dimensional data. This paper explores five key methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Sparse Kernel PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). PCA provides a linear approach to capturing variance, whereas KPCA and Sparse KPCA extend this concept to non-linear structures using kernel functions. Meanwhile, t-SNE and UMAP focus on preserving local relationships, making them effective for data visualization. Each method is examined in terms of its mathematical formulation, computational complexity, strengths, and limitations. The trade-offs between global structure preservation, computational efficiency, and interpretability are discussed to guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate technique based on their application needs.</description>

      <title>Here Be Dragons: Bimodal posteriors arise from numerical integration error in longitudinal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal models with dynamics governed by differential equations may require numerical integration alongside parameter estimation. We have identified a situation where the numerical integration introduces error in such a way that it becomes a novel source of non-uniqueness in estimation. We obtain two very different sets of parameters, one of which is a good estimate of the true values and the other a very poor one. The two estimates have forward numerical projections statistically indistinguishable from each other because of numerical error. In such cases, the posterior distribution for parameters is bimodal, with a dominant mode closer to the true parameter value, and a second cluster around the errant value. We demonstrate that bimodality exists both theoretically and empirically for an affine first order differential equation, that a simulation workflow can test for evidence of the issue more generally, and that Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with a suitable solution can avoid bimodality. The issue of bimodal posteriors arising from numerical error has consequences for Bayesian inverse methods that rely on numerical integration more broadly.</description>

      <title>Deviation Ratings: A General, Clone-Invariant Rating Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world multi-agent or multi-task evaluation scenarios can be naturally modelled as normal-form games due to inherent strategic (adversarial, cooperative, and mixed motive) interactions. These strategic interactions may be agentic (e.g. players trying to win), fundamental (e.g. cost vs quality), or complementary (e.g. niche finding and specialization). In such a formulation, it is the strategies (actions, policies, agents, models, tasks, prompts, etc.) that are rated. However, the rating problem is complicated by redundancy and complexity of N-player strategic interactions. Repeated or similar strategies can distort ratings for those that counter or complement them. Previous work proposed ``clone invariant'' ratings to handle such redundancies, but this was limited to two-player zero-sum (i.e. strictly competitive) interactions. This work introduces the first N-player general-sum clone invariant rating, called deviation ratings, based on coarse correlated equilibria. The rating is explored on several domains including LLMs evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Diagnostic to Find and Help Combat Positivity Issues - with a Focus on Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positivity assumption is central in the identification of a causal effect, yet is rarely discussed, especially in conjunction with continuous treatments or Modified Treatment Policies. One common recommendation for dealing with a violation is to change the estimand. However, an applied researcher is faced with two problems: First, how can she tell whether there is a positivity violation given her estimand of interest, preferably without having to estimate a model first? Second, if she finds a problem with positivity, how should she change her estimand in order to arrive at an estimand which does not face the same issues? We suggest a novel diagnostic which allows the researcher to answer both questions by providing insights into how well an estimation for a certain estimand can be made for each observation using the data at hand. We provide a simulation study on the general behaviour of different MTPs at different levels of positivity violations and show how the diagnostic helps understand where bias is to be expected. We illustrate the application of our proposed diagnostic in a pharmacoepidemiological study based on data from CHAPAS-3, a trial comparing different treatment regimens for children living with HIV.</description>
