      <title>On parametric formulations for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traveling salesman problem is a widely studied classical combinatorial problem for which there are several integer linear formulations. In this work, we consider the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ), Desrochers-Laporte (DL) and Single Commodity Flow (SCF) formulations. We argue that the choice of some parameters of these formulations is arbitrary and, therefore, there are families of formulations of which each of MTZ, DL, and SCF is a particular case. We analyze these families for different choices of the parameters, noting that in general the formulations involved are not comparable to each other and there is no one that dominates the rest. Then we define and study the closure of each family, that is, the set obtained by considering all the associated formulations simultaneously. In particular, we give an explicit integer linear formulation for the closure of each of the families we have defined and then show how they compare to each other.</description>

      <title>On Representing Convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we are the first to investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric structural shape optimization of piecewise developable surfaces using discrete differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-level structural optimization method for obtaining an approximate optimal shape of piecewise developable surface without specifying internal boundaries between surface patches. The condition for developability of a polyhedral surface onto a plane is formulated using the area of discrete Gauss map formed by unit normal vectors at the faces adjacent to each vertex. The objective function of the lower-level optimization problem is the sum of square errors for developability at all interior vertices. The contribution of large error to the objective function is underestimated by filtering with hyperbolic tangent function so that the internal boundary between the surface patches can naturally emerge as a result of optimization. Vertices are located non-periodically to generate the internal boundaries in various unspecified directions. Simulated annealing is used for the upper-level optimization problem for maximizing stiffness evaluated by the compliance under the specified vertical loads. The design variables are the heights of the specified points. It is shown in the numerical examples that the compliance values of the surfaces with a square and a rectangular plan are successfully reduced by the proposed method while keeping the developability of each surface patch. Thus, a new class of structural shape optimization problem of shell surfaces is proposed by limiting the feasible surface to piecewise developable surfaces which have desirable geometrical characteristics in view of fabrication and construction.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of periodic lattice structures for specified mechanical properties using machine learning considering member connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a methodology to utilize machine learning (ML) for topology optimization of periodic lattice structures. In particular, we investigate data representation of lattice structures used as input data for ML models to improve the performance of the models, focusing on the filtering process and feature selection. We use the filtering technique to explicitly consider the connectivity of lattice members and perform feature selection to reduce the input data size. In addition, we propose a convolution approach to apply pre-trained models for small structures to structures of larger sizes. The computational cost for obtaining optimal topologies by a heuristic method is reduced by incorporating the prediction of the trained ML model into the optimization process. In the numerical examples, a response prediction model is constructed for a lattice structure of 4x4 units, and topology optimization of 4x4-unit and 8x8-unit structures is performed by simulated annealing assisted by the trained ML model. The example demonstrates that ML models perform higher accuracy by using the filtered data as input than by solely using the data representing the existence of each member. It is also demonstrated that a small-scale prediction model can be constructed with sufficient accuracy by feature selection. Additionally, the proposed method can find the optimal structure in less computation time than the pure simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jointly Optimal Coding and Control over a Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop rigorous approximation and near optimality results for the optimal control of a system which is connected to a controller over a finite rate noiseless channel. While structural results on the optimal encoding and control have been obtained in the literature, their implementation has been prohibitive in general, except for linear models. We develop regularity and structural properties, followed by approximations and reinforcement learning results. Notably, we establish near optimality of finite model approximations as well as sliding finite window coding policies and their reinforcement learning convergence to near optimality.</description>

      <title>Accelerated zero-order SGD under high-order smoothness and overparameterized regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel gradient-free algorithm to solve a convex stochastic optimization problem, such as those encountered in medicine, physics, and machine learning (e.g., adversarial multi-armed bandit problem), where the objective function can only be computed through numerical simulation, either as the result of a real experiment or as feedback given by the function evaluations from an adversary. Thus we suppose that only a black-box access to the function values of the objective is available, possibly corrupted by adversarial noise: deterministic or stochastic. The noisy setup can arise naturally from modeling randomness within a simulation or by computer discretization, or when exact values of function are forbidden due to privacy issues, or when solving non-convex problems as convex ones with an inexact function oracle. By exploiting higher-order smoothness, fulfilled, e.g., in logistic regression, we improve the performance of zero-order methods developed under the assumption of classical smoothness (or having a Lipschitz gradient). The proposed algorithm enjoys optimal oracle complexity and is designed under an overparameterization setup, i.e., when the number of model parameters is much larger than the size of the training dataset. Overparametrized models fit to the training data perfectly while also having good generalization and outperforming underparameterized models on unseen data. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm under both types of noise. Moreover, we estimate the maximum permissible adversarial noise level that maintains the desired accuracy in the Euclidean setup, and then we extend our results to a non-Euclidean setup. Our theoretical results are verified on the logistic regression problem.</description>

      <title>Orientation Determination of Cryo-EM Images Using Block Stochastic Riemannian Subgradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of molecular orientations is crucial for the three-dimensional reconstruction of Cryo-EM images. Traditionally addressed using the common-line method, this challenge is reformulated as a self-consistency error minimization problem constrained to rotation groups. In this paper, we consider the least-squared deviation (LUD) formulation and employ a Riemannian subgradient method to effectively solve the orientation determination problem. To enhance computational efficiency, a block stochastic version of the method is proposed, and its convergence properties are rigorously established. Extensive numerical evaluations reveal that our method not only achieves accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods but also delivers an average 20-fold speedup. Additionally, we implement a modified formulation and algorithm specifically designed to address scenarios characterized by very low SNR.</description>

      <title>Numerical null controllability of parabolic PDEs using Lagrangian methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several theoretical and numerical questions concerning the null controllability problems for linear parabolic equations and systems for several dimensions. The control is distributed and acts on a small subset of the domain. The main goal is to compute numerically a control that drives a numerical approximation of the state from prescribed initial data exactly to zero. We introduce a methodology for solving numerical controllability problems that is new in some sense. The main idea is to apply classical Lagrangian and Augmented Lagrangian techniques to suitable constrained extremal formulations that involve unbounded weights in time that make global Carleman inequalities possible. The theoretical results are validated by satisfactory numerical experiments for spatially 2D and 3D problems.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of bounded-rank tensor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank tensors appear to be prosperous in many applications. However, the sets of bounded-rank tensors are non-smooth and non-convex algebraic varieties, rendering the low-rank optimization problems to be challenging. To this end, we delve into the geometry of bounded-rank tensor sets, including Tucker and tensor train formats. We propose a desingularization approach for bounded-rank tensor sets by introducing slack variables, resulting in a low-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space while preserving the structure of low-rank tensor formats. Subsequently, optimization on tensor varieties can be reformulated to optimization on smooth manifolds, where the methods and convergence are well explored. We reveal the relationship between the landscape of optimization on varieties and that of optimization on manifolds. Numerical experiments on tensor completion illustrate that the proposed methods are in favor of others under different rank parameters.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy System Design via Semi-infinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series information needs to be incorporated into energy system optimization to account for the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. Typically, time-series aggregation methods are used to reduce historical data to a few representative scenarios but they may neglect extreme scenarios, which disproportionally drive the costs in energy system design. We propose the robust energy system design (RESD) approach based on semi-infinite programming and use an adaptive discretization-based algorithm to identify worst-case scenarios during optimization. The RESD approach can guarantee robust designs for problems with nonconvex operational behavior, which current methods cannot achieve. The RESD approach is demonstrated by designing an energy supply system for the island of La Palma. To improve computational performance, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the uncertainty space. The robustness and costs of the approximated problem with significantly reduced dimensionality approximate the full-dimensional solution closely. Even with strong dimensionality reduction, the RESD approach is computationally intense and thus limited to small problems.</description>

      <title>On Dual of LMIs for Absolute Stability Analysis of Nonlinear Feedback Systems with Static O'Shea-Zames-Falb Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the absolute stability criteria based on the framework of integral quadratic constraint (IQC) for feedback systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities. In existing works, well-known absolute stability certificates expressed in the IQC-based linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) were derived, in which the input-to-output characteristics of the slope-restricted nonlinearities were captured through static O'Shea-Zames-Falb multipliers. However, since these certificates are only sufficient conditions, they provide no clue about the absolute stability in the case where the LMIs are infeasible. In this paper, by taking advantage of the duality theory of LMIs, we derive a condition for systems to be not absolutely stable when the above-mentioned LMIs are infeasible. In particular, we can identify a destabilizing nonlinearity within the assumed class of slope-restricted nonlinearities as well as a non-zero equilibrium point of the resulting closed-loop system, by which the system is proved to be not absolutely stable. We demonstrate the soundness of our results by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Note on Complexity for Two Classes of Structured Non-Smooth Non-Convex Compositional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note studies numerical methods for solving compositional optimization problems, where the inner function is smooth, and the outer function is Lipschitz continuous, non-smooth, and non-convex but exhibits one of two special structures that enable the design of efficient first-order methods. In the first structure, the outer function allows for an easily solvable proximal mapping. We demonstrate that, in this case, a smoothing compositional gradient method can find a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point--specifically defined for compositional optimization--in $O(1/(\delta \epsilon^2))$ iterations. In the second structure, the outer function is expressed as a difference-of-convex function, where each convex component is simple enough to allow an efficiently solvable proximal linear subproblem. In this case, we show that a prox-linear method can find a nearly ${\epsilon}$-critical point in $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Stability Analysis of the Extended Infinite Horizon Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a popular technology to operate industrial systems. It refers to a class of control algorithms that use an explicit model of the system to obtain the control action by minimizing a cost function. At each time step, MPC solves an optimization problem that minimizes the future deviation of the outputs which are calculated from the model. The solution of the optimization problem is a sequence of control inputs, the first input is applied to the system, and the optimization process is repeated at subsequent time steps. In the context of MPC, convergence and stability are fundamental issues. A common approach to obtain MPC stability is by setting the prediction horizon as infinite. For stable open-loop systems, the infinite horizon can be reduced to a finite horizon MPC with a terminal weight computed through the solution of a Lyapunov equation. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of the extended nominally stable MPC developed by Odloak [Odloak, D. Extended robust model predictive control, AIChE J. 50 (8) (2004) 1824-1836] and the stable MPC with zone control [Gonz\'alez, A.H., Odloak, D. A stable MPC with zone control, J. Proc. Cont. 19 (2009) 110-122]. The mathematical proofs consider that the system is represented by a general gain matrix $D_0$, i.e., not necessarily regular, and they are developed for any input horizon $m$. The proofs are based on elementary geometric and algebraic tools and we believe that they can be adapted to the derived MPC approaches, as well as future studies.</description>

      <title>Sampling Observability for Heat Equations with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the sampling observability for the heat equations with memory in the lower-order term, where the observation is conducted at a finite number of time instants and on a small open subset at each time instant. We present a two-sided sampling observability inequality and give a sharp sufficient condition to ensure the aforementioned inequality. We also provide a method to select the time instants and then to design the observation regions, based on a given memory kernel, such that the above-mentioned inequality holds for these time instants and observation regions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the positions of these time instants depend significantly on the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Optimal portfolio under ratio-type periodic evaluation in stochastic factor models under convex trading constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a type of periodic utility maximization problems for portfolio management in incomplete stochastic factor models with convex trading constraints. The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the relative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon, featuring the dynamic adjustments in portfolio decision according to past achievements. Under power utility, we transform the original infinite horizon optimal control problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem under a modified utility function. To cope with the convex trading constraints, we further introduce an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem in a modified market model and develop the martingale duality approach to establish the existence of the dual minimizer such that the optimal unconstrained wealth process can be obtained using the dual representation. With the help of the duality results in the auxiliary problems, the relationship between the constrained and unconstrained models as well as some fixed point arguments, we finally derive and verify the optimal constrained portfolio process in a periodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence Rates and Concentration of Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning with Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first almost sure convergence rate and the first maximal concentration bound with exponential tails for general contractive stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence rates in $L^p$. Key to our successes is a novel discretization of the mean ODE of stochastic approximation algorithms using intervals with diminishing (instead of constant) length. As applications, we provide the first almost sure convergence rate for $Q$-learning with Markovian samples without count-based learning rates. We also provide the first concentration bound for off-policy temporal difference learning with Markovian samples.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem for Jump Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP) seeks to find the measure $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ on a certain path space which interpolates between state-space distributions $\rho_0$ at time $0$ and $\rho_T$ at time $T$ while minimizing the KL divergence (relative entropy) to a reference path measure $\mathbf{R}$. In this work, we tackle the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion. Under mild assumptions, with both the operator theory approach and the stochastic calculus techniques, we establish an $h$-transform theory for jump diffusions and devise an approximation method to achieve the jump-diffusion SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ as the strong-convergence limit of a sequence of harmonic $h$-transforms. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel in the study of SBP. Moreover, the $h$-transform framework and the approximation method developed in this work are robust and applicable to a relatively general class of jump diffusions. In addition, we examine the SBP of particular types of jump diffusions under additional regularity conditions and extend the existing results on the SBP from the diffusion case to the jump-diffusion setting.</description>

      <title>Process and Policy Insights from Intercomparing Electricity System Capacity Expansion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study undertakes a detailed intercomparison of four open-source electricity system capacity expansion models--Temoa, Switch, GenX, and USENSYS--to examine their suitability for guiding U.S. power sector decarbonization policies. We isolate the effects of model-specific differences on policy outcomes and investment decisions by harmonizing empirical inputs via PowerGenome and systematically defining "scenarios" (policy conditions) and "configurations" (model setup choices). Our framework allows each model to be tested on identical assumptions for policy, technology costs, and operational constraints, thus distinguishing results that arise from data inputs or configuration versus inherent model structure. Key findings highlight that, when harmonized, models produce very similar capacity portfolios under each current policies and net-zero configuration, with less than 1 percent difference in system costs for most configurations. This agreement across models allows us to examine the impact of configuration choices. For example, configurations that assume unit commitment constraints or economic retirement of generators reveal the difference in investment decisions and system costs that arise from these modeling choices, underscoring the need for clear scenario and configuration definitions in policy guidance. Through this study, we identify critical structural assumptions that influence model outcomes and demonstrate the advantages of a standardized approach when using capacity expansion models. This work offers a valuable benchmark and identifies a few key modeling choices for policymakers, which ultimately will enhance transparency and reliability in modeling efforts to inform the clean energy transition for clean energy planning.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Algorithms for Quadratic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating computation by harnessing the thermalization properties of physical systems. This work introduces a novel approach to solving quadratic programming problems using thermodynamic hardware. By incorporating a thermodynamic subroutine for solving linear systems into the interior-point method, we present a hybrid digital-analog algorithm that outperforms traditional digital algorithms in terms of speed. Notably, we achieve a polynomial asymptotic speedup compared to conventional digital approaches. Additionally, we simulate the algorithm for a support vector machine and predict substantial practical speedups with only minimal degradation in solution quality. Finally, we detail how our method can be applied to portfolio optimization and the simulation of nonlinear resistive networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study evolutionary equations in exponentially weighted $\mathrm{L}^{2}$-spaces as introduced by Picard in 2009. First, for a given evolutionary equation, we explicitly describe the $\nu$-adjoint system, which turns out to describe a system backwards in time. We prove well-posedness for the $\nu$-adjoint system. We then apply the thus obtained duality to introduce and study notions of null-controllability for evolutionary equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally controlling stochastic, Markovian systems subject to joint chance constraints over a finite-time horizon. For such problems, standard Dynamic Programming is inapplicable due to the time correlation of the joint chance constraints, which calls for non-Markovian, and possibly stochastic, policies. Hence, despite the popularity of this problem, solution approaches capable of providing provably-optimal and easy-to-compute policies are still missing. We fill this gap by augmenting the dynamics via a binary state, allowing us to characterize the optimal policies and develop a Dynamic Programming based solution method.</description>

      <title>Identifying a piecewise affine signal from its nonlinear observation -- application to DNA replication analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA replication stands as one of the fundamental biological processes crucial for cellular functioning. Recent experimental developments enable the study of replication dynamics at the single-molecule level for complete genomes, facilitating a deeper understanding of its main parameters. In these new data, replication dynamics is reported by the incorporation of an exogenous chemical, whose intra-cellular concentration follows a nonlinear function. The analysis of replication traces thus gives rise to a nonlinear inverse problem, presenting a nonconvex optimization challenge. We demonstrate that under noiseless conditions, the replication dynamics can be uniquely identified by the proposed model. Computing a global solution to this optimization problem is specially challenging because of its multiple local minima. We present the DNA-inverse optimization method that is capable of finding this global solution even in the presence of noise. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art optimization methods highlights the superior computational efficiency of our approach. DNA-inverse enables the automatic recovery of all configurations of the replication dynamics, which was not possible with previous methods.</description>

      <title>B-ary Tree Push-Pull Method is Provably Efficient for Distributed Learning on Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed learning problem where a group of agents cooperatively minimizes the summation of their local cost functions based on peer-to-peer communication. Particularly, we propose a highly efficient algorithm, termed ``B-ary Tree Push-Pull'' (BTPP), that employs two B-ary spanning trees for distributing the information related to the parameters and stochastic gradients across the network. The simple method is efficient in communication since each agent interacts with at most $(B+1)$ neighbors per iteration. More importantly, BTPP achieves linear speedup for smooth nonconvex and strongly convex objective functions with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ and $\tilde{O}(1)$ transient iterations, respectively, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art results to the best of our knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/ryou98/BTPP.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent for Noisy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the use of gradient descent with backtracking line search (GD-BLS) to solve the noisy optimization problem $\theta_\star:=\mathrm{argmin}_{\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{E}[f(\theta,Z)]$, imposing that the function $F(\theta):=\mathbb{E}[f(\theta,Z)]$ is strictly convex but not necessarily $L$-smooth. Assuming that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla_\theta f(\theta_\star,Z)\|^2]&lt;\infty$, we first prove that sample average approximation based on GD-BLS allows to estimate $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-0.25})$, where $B$ is the available computational budget. We then show that we can improve upon this rate by stopping the optimization process earlier when the gradient of the objective function is sufficiently close to zero, and use the residual computational budget to optimize, again with GD-BLS, a finer approximation of $F$. By iteratively applying this strategy $J$ times, we establish that we can estimate $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-\frac{1}{2}(1-\delta^{J})})$, where $\delta\in(1/2,1)$ is a user-specified parameter. More generally, we show that if $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla_\theta f(\theta_\star,Z)\|^{1+\alpha}]&lt;\infty$ for some known $\alpha\in (0,1]$ then this approach, which can be seen as a retrospective approximation algorithm with a fixed computational budget, allows to learn $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}(1-\delta^{J})})$, where $\delta\in(2\alpha/(1+3\alpha),1)$ is a tuning parameter. Beyond knowing $\alpha$, achieving the aforementioned convergence rates do not require to tune the algorithms parameters according to the specific functions $F$ and $f$ at hand, and we exhibit a simple noisy optimization problem for which stochastic gradient is not guaranteed to converge while the algorithms discussed in this work are.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Necessary optimality conditions in Lagrangian form and the augmented Lagrangian framework are extended to mixed-integer nonlinear optimization, without any convexity assumptions. Building upon a recently developed notion of local optimality for problems with polyhedral and integrality constraints, a characterization of local minimizers and critical points is given for problems including also nonlinear constraints. This approach lays the foundations for developing affordable sequential minimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to critical points from arbitrary initializations. A primal-dual perspective, a local saddle point property, and the dual relationships with the proximal point algorithm are also advanced in the presence of integer variables.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, certain matrix based problems and a numerical experiment on a feed-forward neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two regularized proximal quasi-Newton methods with symmetric rank-1 update of the metric (SR1 quasi-Newton) to solve non-smooth convex additive composite problems. Both algorithms avoid using line search or other trust region strategies. For each of them, we prove a super-linear convergence rate that is independent of the initialization of the algorithm. The cubic regularized method achieves a rate of order $\left(\frac{C}{N^{1/2}}\right)^{N/2}$, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $C$ is some constant, and the other gradient regularized method shows a rate of the order $\left(\frac{C}{N^{1/4}}\right)^{N/2}$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first global non-asymptotic super-linear convergence rates for regularized quasi-Newton methods and regularized proximal quasi-Newton methods. The theoretical properties are also demonstrated in two applications from machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates discrete-time Markov decision processes with recursive utilities (or payoffs) defined by the classic CES aggregator and the Kreps-Porteus certainty equivalent operator. According to the classification introduced by Marinacci and Montrucchio, the aggregators that we consider are Thompson. We focus on the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the Bellman equation. Since the per-period utilities can be unbounded, we work with the weighted supremum norm. Our paper shows three major points for such models. Firstly, we prove that the Bellman equation can be obtained by the Banach fixed point theorem for contraction mappings acting on a standard complete metric space. Secondly, we need not assume any boundary conditions, which are present when the Thompson metric or the Du's theorem are used. Thirdly, our results give better bounds for the geometric convergence of the value iteration algorithm than those obtained by Du's fixed point theorem. Moreover, our techniques allow to derive the Bellman equation for some values of parameters in the CES aggregator and the Kreps-Porteus certainty equivalent that cannot be solved by Du's theorem for increasing and convex or concave operators acting on an ordered Banach space.</description>

Abstract: Several dynamical systems in fields such as engineering, chemistry, biology, and physics show impulsive behavior by reason of unexpected changes at specific times. These behaviors are described by differential systems under impulse effects. The current paper examines approximate controllability for semi-linear impulsive differential and neutral differential equations in Hilbert spaces. By applying a fixed-point method and semigroup theory, a new sufficient condition is provided for the ($\mathcal{A}$-controllability) approximate controllability of neutral and impulsive differential equations (IDEs). To demonstrate the value of the suggested consequences, three examples are presented, offering improvements over some recent findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to optimize multiple, possibly conflicting objectives with widespread applications. We introduce a novel interacting particle method for MOO inspired by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach combines overdamped Langevin and birth-death dynamics, incorporating a "dominance potential" to steer particles toward global Pareto optimality. In contrast to previous methods, our method is able to relocate dominated particles, making it particularly adept at managing Pareto fronts of complicated geometries. Our method is also theoretically grounded as a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>The sticky particle dynamics of the 1D pressureless Euler-alignment system as a gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the sticky dynamics for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler-alignment system can be obtained as an $L^2$-gradient flow of a convex functional. This is analogous to the Lagrangian evolution introduced by Natile and Savar\'{e} for the pressureless Euler system, and by Brenier et al. for the corresponding system with a self-interacting force field. Our Lagrangian evolution can be seen as the limit of sticky particle Cucker-Smale dynamics, similar to the solutions obtained by Leslie and Tan from a corresponding scalar balance law, and provides us with a uniquely determined distributional solution of the original system in the space of probability measures with quadratic moments and corresponding square-integrable velocities. Moreover, we show that the gradient flow also provides an entropy solution to the balance law of Leslie and Tan, and how their results on cluster formation follow naturally from (non-)monotonicity properties of the so-called natural velocity of the flow.</description>

      <title>Confronting Conflicts to Yes: Untangling Wicked Problems with Open Design Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10549</link>

Abstract: Current project development practices often fail to engage stakeholders early and effectively. Decision support is often non-inclusive, single-sided, and lacking in transparency, while complexity goes beyond human's comprehension. Additionally, many approaches focus primarily on technical system aspects, neglecting the integration of stakeholders' individual preferences. This often results in project impasses, leaving stakeholders unable to collaboratively achieve a "yes." There is a need for a purely associative, a-priori design approach that integrates system realities and stakeholder ideals within a joint socio-technical solution space. The state-of-the-art Preferendus, embedded in the proven Open Design Systems (Odesys) methodology, is a neutral tool for transforming complexity into success. Aiming for synthesis, Odesys' robust IMAP optimization method generates a single best-fit design solution. Here, Odesys is applied for a Dutch wind farm stalemate development, balancing multiple stakeholder preferences, wind farm performances, and project constraints. The success of this approach hinges on stakeholder trust and input. This article introduces a structured stakeholder assessment method using choice-based conjunctive analysis (CBCA), facilitating transparent determination of global and local stakeholder weights and preference functions. Modelling 'disputable' exogenous factors as endogenous design parameters, the application demonstrates how one can shift toward a collaborative "yes." For this, it is concluded that a zoomed-out solution space would enable the energy transition to be tackled with multiple options rather than a prescribed one. The Odesys approach fosters decision-making that aligns with the social threefold principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity, guiding projects toward genuine democratic outcomes rather than selecting from curated options.</description>

      <title>FracGM: A Fast Fractional Programming Technique for Geman-McClure Robust Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in computer vision, robotics, and navigation, aiming to minimize the impact of outlier measurements for improved accuracy. We present a fast algorithm for Geman-McClure robust estimation, FracGM, leveraging fractional programming techniques. This solver reformulates the original non-convex fractional problem to a convex dual problem and a linear equation system, iteratively solving them in an alternating optimization pattern. Compared to graduated non-convexity approaches, this strategy exhibits a faster convergence rate and better outlier rejection capability. In addition, the global optimality of the proposed solver can be guaranteed under given conditions. We demonstrate the proposed FracGM solver with Wahba's rotation problem and 3-D point-cloud registration along with relaxation pre-processing and projection post-processing. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, when the outlier rates increase from 20% to 80%, FracGM shows 53% and 88% lower rotation and translation increases. In real-world scenarios, FracGM achieves better results in 13 out of 18 outcomes, while having a 19.43% improvement in the computation time.</description>

      <title>Approximation rates of entropic maps in semidiscrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport offers a computationally tractable approximation to the classical problem. In this note, we study the approximation rate of the entropic optimal transport map (in approaching the Brenier map) when the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero in the semidiscrete setting, where the input measure is absolutely continuous while the output is finitely discrete. Previous work shows that the approximation rate is $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under the $L^2$-norm with respect to the input measure. In this work, we establish faster, $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rates up to polylogarithmic factors, under the dual Lipschitz norm, which is weaker than the $L^2$-norm. For the said dual norm, the $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rate is sharp. As a corollary, we derive a central limit theorem for the entropic estimator for the Brenier map in the dual Lipschitz space when the regularization parameter tends to zero as the sample size increases.</description>
