      <title>A Unified Analytic Framework for Microlensing Caustics: Geode Solutions and Hyper--Catalan Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a preparation-invariant analytic description of image formation near microlensing caustics. After a local Weierstrass preparation at any multiple image (order $d\ge2$), the lens mapping reduces to a single geode variable $m$ satisfying $m=U\,\varphi(m)$, where $U$ is a prepared source coordinate and $\varphi$ is an image-side kernel. The coefficients of $m(U)$ obey closed Hyper-Catalan (HC) recurrences, allowing termwise derivatives and truncation control from the characteristic system. We also use the same form for a short HC predictor-corrector: evaluate the series within its certified radius and apply a brief Newton polish near the boundary. We define an HC signature (first nonzero kernel coefficients) and an HC spectrum (branch points and analyticity radius $\rho_U$), which quantify sparsity, stiffness, and safe evaluation domains. The construction covers folds and cusps of any global degree. On a binary fold and cusp, an artificial decic with a resonant unit, and two triple-lens cusps of a challenging geometry, HC seeds plus a few Newton steps recover the exact images to machine precision within the certified domain and maintain continuity under continuation. The resulting single-series templates (with $(\mathrm{Sig}_R,\rho_U)$ metadata) are ready for photometric and astrometric modeling.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Radio Sky: Bayesian Ensemble Learning and SVD-Based Feature Extraction for Automated Radio Galaxy Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of radio galaxies is central to understanding galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei dynamics, and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Image and Spectrophotometry Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the SPHEREx image and spectrophotometry data processing pipeline, an infrastructure and software system designed to produce calibrated spectral images and photometric measurements for NASA's SPHEREx mission. SPHEREx is carrying out a series of four all-sky spectrophotometric surveys at 6.15 arcsecond resolution in 102 spectral channels spanning 0.75 to 5 microns. The pipeline which will deliver the flux- and wavelength-calibrated data products deriving from these surveys has been developed and is operated by the SPHEREx Science Data Center at Caltech/IPAC in collaboration with the SPHEREx Science Team. Here we describe the framework and modules used in the pipeline, along with the data products, which are available at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive.</description>

      <title>Optimization design and analysis for the mechanical test platform of scientific probe module of the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the design and analysis of the mechanical test platform for the scientific probe module of the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph, which is the fifth part of the China Space Station survey Telescope. First, according to the module layout and economic requirements, the preliminary structural design of the module mechanical test platform is carried out, and the stiffness sensitive parameters of the assembly are identified to determine the optimization parameters. The Central Composite Design method is used to design the test platform, and a third-order regression model is constructed for response surface analysis. The third-order response surface model of the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the test platform is obtained by fitting the test data with the least squares method, and the structure of the module mechanical test platform is determined. The modal analysis is carried out to determine the fundamental frequency and vibration modes of the mechanical test platform. The vibration response of the platform is simulated by sine, random and swept frequency vibration simulations. The response surface fitting algorithm is verified by the test platform swept frequency test. The agreement between the response surface fitting algorithm and the experiment is good. The fundamental frequency of the test platform is 436.2Hz (&gt;300Hz), which meets the design index requirements of the test platform and can accurately guide the optimization design work. At the same time, it provides the theoretical basis and design method for the structural design of the Chinese manned space station.</description>

      <title>The Fluorescence Camera for the PBR mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an instrument designed to be borne by a NASA suborbital Super Pressure Balloon (SPB), in a mission planned to last as long as 50 days. The PBR instrument consists of a 1.1 m aperture Schmidt telescope, similar to the POEMMA design, with two cameras in its hybrid focal surface: a Fluorescence Camera (FC) and a Cherenkov Camera (CC), both mounted on a frame that can be tilted to point from nadir up to 13 degrees above the horizon. The FC camera is designed to detect the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. The FC will be made of 4 Photo Detection Modules (PDMs), each consisting of a 6x6 matrix of 64-channel Multi Anode PhotoMulTipliers (MAPMT), for a grand total of 2304 pixels for each PDM. Custom-designed SPACIROC-3 ASICs perform single photoelectron counting on each pixel as well as charge integration on groups of 8 pixels to measure extremely bright or fast signals, reaching a double pulse resolution in the order of 10 ns for a 1 microsecond acquisition gate. A field flattener lens and a BG3 filter, to match the wavelength range of interest (300-400 nm), are mounted in front of the PDM. The camera will be able to detect showers in a field of view of 24x24 square degrees, with a pixel size on ground corresponding to 115 m. Details on the camera design and implementation will be given, along with the expected performance and the state of the construction.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of $\sim 100$ and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of $\sim 70$, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.</description>

      <title>WFC3/UVIS EPER CTE 2009-2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we examine the behavior of Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) on the WFC3/UVIS detector over time as computed by the Extended Pixel Edge Response (EPER) technique, using internal calibration data acquired from 2009 through 2025. We find that the CTE has continued to decline as expected, with a steeper loss rate for lower signal levels. The lowest signal level (160e-) has continued to decline at a rate of 0.0001 per year, with a total overall decline of 0.0015. Analyses from 2016 and 2020 found that the rate of decline was not well fit by a linear function. This report verifies the rate of decline is instead better fit by a quadratic function (which results in the smallest min. and max. residuals, on average) or a cubic function (which has the best "goodness of fit" $\chi^2$ and $R^2$ values). We continue to see periodic oscillations of the residuals around all three fit lines (linear, quadratic, and cubic) on which we perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the residuals. We find a periodicity of about 8 years for the residuals around the linear fit lines and about 9 years for the quadratic and cubic fit lines.</description>

      <title>WFC3/IR Geometric Distortion - Time Evolution of Linear Terms w.r.t. Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relative offsets of the linear terms in the geometric distortion between WFC3/IR and the Gaia DR3 catalog using the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) pipeline WFC3/IR to Gaia DR3 alignment solutions to assess temporal stability over the lifetime of the WFC3 instrument (2009-2024). We find a period of increased uncertainty and offsets in the rotation term between 2018 and 2021, as seen in a previous analysis of WFC3/UVIS linear geometric distortion (O'Connor et al., 2024), corresponding with a period of increased jitter. We find a similar pattern of increased uncertainty between 2018 and 2021 in the skew offsets to Gaia DR3, as well. We find no significant linear temporal evolution in the rotation, skew, or scale offsets between the WFC3/IR IDCTAB distortion solution and Gaia DR3 over the 16-year lifetime of the WFC3 instrument; however, we do see temporal evolution in the shift offsets (the difference -in pixels- between the IDCTAB and Gaia WCS positions), which are dominated by telescope pointing inaccuracy external to the WFC3/IR geometric distortion solution. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we continue to recommend that observers verify or improve image alignment using the tweakreg routine.</description>

      <title>How Single-Star Guiding affects HST's Pointing Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HST is designed to use two guide stars (GSs) in the fine-guidance sensors (FGSs) to maintain its pointing and tracking during exposures. The primary GS holds the boresight fixed and the secondary GS keeps the orientation fixed. However, HST is also able to track using only a single GS by fixing the boresite on one star and maintaining the orientation using the available gyro(s). We evaluate the pointing quality achieved in this latter case, when one GS and one gyro (RGM, a.k.a., reduced gyro mode) are used. We find that in 1GS-RGM, there is indeed more drift during the course of an orbit than when two guide stars are used, but the drift is much smaller than was seen in previous times of sub-optimal gyro performance. We quantify the 1GS-RGM drift seen in recent archival GO data and in images from a test calibration program and find that (a) for exposures &lt; 500 sec, the PSF quality in 1GS is indistinguishable from that of 2GS and (b) over the course of full orbits (~2500 sec), the drift in four of five cases was less than 0.2 pixel and ~0.4 pix in the other case. Such a drift is marginally detectable in observations, but it should have a marginal impact on most science programs, since the variation in the PSF caused by drift is smaller than the PSF variations with focus and with location on the detector. For observers who wish to correct drift effects, we show that the use of a perturbed PSF during post-acquisition data analysis removes essentially all astrometric residuals, even for drift levels up to ~0.5 pix, as well as most of the photometric residuals.</description>

      <title>A Butterfly's Eye Camera for Intensity Interferometry with Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the "I3T concept", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called "Butterfly's Eye" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging in very long baseline interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting polarimetric information from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data is demanding but vital for understanding the synchrotron radiation process and the magnetic fields of celestial objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, conventional CLEAN-based calibration and imaging methods provide suboptimal resolution without uncertainty estimation of calibration solutions, while requiring manual steering from an experienced user. We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays. The pipeline developed for this work is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: A Machine Learning Ready Dataset for Ionospheric Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Astronomy: An End-to-End SNN Pipeline for RFI Detection Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imminent radio telescope observatories provide massive data rates making deep learning based processing appealing while simultaneously demanding real-time performance at low-energy; prohibiting the use of many artificial neural network based approaches. We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance. Our work thus provides a practical deployment blueprint, a key insight into the challenges of model scaling, and reinforces radio astronomy as a demanding yet ideal domain for advancing applied neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Development and Testing of a Modular Large-Area Cosmic Ray Telescope Using Scintillator-Fiber Hybrid Design for Millimeter-Level Muon Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muons, owing to their high penetration power and abundance, have been widely employed as a natural probe in experimental particle physics. We developed a meter-scale cosmic-ray muon telescope, consisting of two parallel super-layers (1 m $\times$ 1 m) separated vertically by one meter. A super-layer is composed of two orthogonal detection layers, of which each consists of eighteen modules arranged in parallel and packed closely together. A module consists of a plastic scintillating bar precisely aligned and stacked on top of an underlying scintillating fiber mat. The telescope employs a detection scheme combining scintillating bars and fibers to meet the requirement of spatial resolution and to reduce the number of readout electronic channels.
  This article presents the comprehensive development of the telescope, encompassing its geometric design, data acquisition system, and performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the telescope achieves a position resolution better than 2 mm and an overall detection efficiency of $\sim$85%. The innovative design keeps the manufacturing cost low while maintaining high spatial resolution and detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Development &amp; Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Neutrino Reconstruction of Single-line Events in the ANTARES Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the $N$-fit algorithm designed to improve the reconstruction of neutrino events detected by a single line of the ANTARES underwater telescope, usually associated with low energy neutrino events ($\sim$ 100 GeV). $N$-Fit is a neural network model that relies on deep learning and combines several advanced techniques in machine learning --deep convolutional layers, mixture density output layers, and transfer learning. This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $\chi^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches. Tests on Monte Carlo simulations and data demonstrate a significant reduction in mean and median absolute errors across all reconstructed parameters. The improvements achieved by $N$-Fit highlight its potential for advancing multimessenger astrophysics and enhancing our ability to probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model using single-line events from ANTARES data.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Single-Antenna Radio Astronomical Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial reviews the mathematical foundations of single-antenna radio polarimetry with the aim of fostering a conceptual understanding of the relationships between a physical description of signal propagation (gain, delay, reflection, down-conversion, etc.), the corresponding transformations of the electric field vector, and the equivalent operations on the Stokes parameters. The adopted framework is based on the work of Britton (2000) and Hamaker (2000) and applied to analyze the signal path described by Hamaker et al. (1996) with additional corrections for phase convention and reflection. Some objective criteria for selecting a model of the instrumental response are introduced and discussed, along with some practical guidelines that facilitate polarimetric calibration. Further relevant background material and lengthier mathematical proofs are included in the appendix, which introduces the vector, matrix, and tensor notation and concepts of linear algebra used in this work. The appendix also reviews some of the basics of analog and digital signal processing that are relevant to radio astronomy, and discusses some numerical instabilities that arise when modeling observations.</description>

      <title>POLAR-2 -- Latest Developments of the Next Generation GRB Polarimeter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.</description>

      <title>TIME Commissioning Observations: I. Mapping Dust and Molecular Gas in the Sgr A Molecular Cloud Complex at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.</description>

Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>

      <title>Indirect forces in disc-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</description>
