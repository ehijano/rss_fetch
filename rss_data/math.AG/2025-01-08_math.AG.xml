      <title>Arithmetic Cycles with Modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add analytic components to algebraic cycles with modulus and define an arithmetic Chow group with modulus that resembles the classical arithmetic Chow groups by Gillet and Soul\'e. The analytic component is dictated by imposing a vanishing condition on the cohomology class of a cycle with modulus. We prove several natural properties of this group as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Hecke modifications of vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hecke modifications of vector bundles have played a significant role in several areas of mathematics. They appear in subjects ranging from number theory to complex geometry. This article intends to be a friendly introduction to the subject. We give an overview of how Hecke modifications appear in the literature, explain their origin and their importance in number theory and classical algebraic geometry. Moreover, we report the progress made in describing Hecke modifications explicitly and why these explicit descriptions are important. We describe all the Hecke modifications of the trivial rank $2$ vector bundle over a closed point of degree $5$ in the projective line, as well as all the vector bundles over a certain elliptic curve, which admit a rank $2$ and degree $0$ trace bundle as a Hecke modification. This result is not present in existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the torsion subgroup of the abelian fundamental group is finite for a regular geometrically integral projective variety over a local field. We also study the structure of $SK_1(X)$ for a regular projective variety $X$ over a local field. As an application, we get class field theory for regular projective curves over local fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the termination of minimal model programs for log canonical pairs in the complex analytic setting. By using the termination, we prove a relation between the minimal model theory for projective log canonical pairs and that for log canonical pairs in the complex analytic setting. The minimal model programs for algebraic stacks and analytic stacks are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We gather evidence for a conjecture of Galkin predicting the derived category of the Fano variety of lines contained in a smooth cubic fourfold to be equivalent to the Hilbert square of the Kuznetsov component of the derived category of the cubic. We prove the conjecture for generic Fano varieties admitting a rational Lagrangian fibration and show that the natural Hodge structures of weight two associated with the Fano variety and the Hilbert square are isometric.</description>

      <title>Reduction of bielliptic hyperelliptic functions of genus 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the problem about the reduction of hyperelliptic functions of genus 3. Our research was motivated by applications to the theory of equations and dynamical systems integrable in hyperelliptic functions. In this paper, we consider a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 which admits a morphism of degree 2 to an elliptic curve. We express the hyperelliptic functions associated with the curve of genus 3 in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic functions and hyperelliptic functions of genus 2.</description>

      <title>Around the topological classification problem of polynomial maps: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the topology of polynomial maps originates from classical questions in affine geometry, such as the Jacobian Conjecture, as well as from works of Whitney, Thom, and Mather in the 1950-70s on diffeomorphism types of smooth maps. During that period, Thom came up with a famous construction of a one-dimensional family of real polynomial maps having fixed degree nine and infinitely many topological types. In his convention, a topological type of a map is preserved precisely when it is composed with a homeomorphism on the source space, and one on the target space.
  Thom also conjectured that for each pair $(n,d)$, any family of $n$--variate, degree--$d$ (complex, or real) polynomial functions has at most finitely-many topological types. Soon after, a collection of results by several mathematicians throughout the 1970s and 1980s settled this conjecture, and solved its subsequent generalization to polynomial maps.
  In this survey, we outline the historical context and highlight a range of significant works from the 1950s to the present day that lead to the current state of the art in the study of polynomial maps' topology. The focal point of this survey is to shed some light on the ensuing classification problem of topological types of polynomial maps. The presentation is achieved by making a gentle introduction to several other prominent questions in affine geometry, all of which are recounted through the lens of the above classification problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the algebraic and transcendental lattices of a general cubic fourfold with a symplectic automorphism of prime order. We prove the rationality of two families of cubic fourfolds, and that they are not equivariantly rational with respect to their group of automorphisms. As an application, we classify the cohomological action of symplectic birational transformations of manifolds of OG10 type that are induced by prime order sympletic automorphisms of cubic fourfolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of a divisor of degree $3$ and rank at least $1$ on a tropical curve is equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate harmonic morphism of degree $3$ from a tropical modification of it to a tropical rational curve. Using the second description, we define the moduli space of tropical trigonal covers and the moduli space of tropical trigonal curves, the latter as a locus in the moduli space of tropical curves. We also prove that the locus of $3$-edge connected genus $g$ tropical trigonal curves has the same dimension as the moduli space of genus $g$ algebraic trigonal curves.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show variants of the genus inequality for the irreducible components of the special fiber of an arithmetic curve over a henselian discrete valuation ring of residue characteristic zero that take into account the non-existence of rational, respectively real points on the the components. We then apply this inequality to obtain the bound $2^{ng}$ (respectively $2^{n(g+1)}$) on the totally positive sum-of-two-squares index in the function field of a curve of genus $g$ over the field of $n$-fold iterated real Laurent series with (respectively without) real points. The bound $2^{n(g+1)}$ had been previously known only for hyperelliptic curves.</description>

Abstract: Caro and Pasten gave an explicit upper bound on the number of rational points on a hyperbolic surface that is embedded in an abelian variety of rank at most one. We show how to use their method to produce a refined bound on the number of rational points on the surface $W_2 := C+C$ in the case of a hyperelliptic curve $C$ of genus $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Combining this with work of Siksek, we use this to determine $W_2(\mathbb{Q})$ in a selection of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to generalize Rubin's theorem on values of Katz's $p$-adic $L$-function outside the range of interpolation from the case of Hecke characters of CM elliptic curves to more general self-dual algebraic Hecke characters. We follow the approach by Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna, based on generalized Heegner cycles, which we extend from characters of imaginary quadratic fields of infinity type $(1,0)$ to characters of infinity type $(1+\ell,-\ell)$ for an integer $\ell\geq0$.</description>

      <title>On Classifying HyperK\"ahler Kummer 8-Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HyperK\"ahler spaces, including manifolds, orbifolds and conical singularities play an important role in superstring/$M$-theory and gauge theories as well as in differential and algebraic geometry. In this paper we provide hundreds of new examples of compact hyperK\"ahler orbifolds of Kummer type $T^8/G$, where $T^8$ is the maximal torus of the compact Lie group $E_8$ and $G$ a finite group of isometries whose holonomies form a subgroup of the Weyl group of $E_8$. We show that, out of all of these examples, the only orbifolds whose singularities have a known holomorphic symplectic resolution lead to manifolds diffeomorphic to the two currently known examples of compact hyperK\"ahler 8-manifolds. We also demonstrate that these methods can, when combined with theorems of Joyce, be extended to construct potentially new manifolds of $\operatorname{SU}(4)$- and $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$- holonomy. All of these examples give rise to new vacua of string/$M$-theory in two/three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Computer-assisted proofs for finding the monodromy of Picard-Fuchs differential equations for a family of K3 toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a numerical method for rigorously finding the monodromy of linear differential equations. Beginning at a base point where certain particular solutions are explicitly given by series expansions, we first compute the value of fundamental system of solutions using interval arithmetic to rigorously control truncation and rounding errors. The solutions are then analytically continued along a prescribed contour encircling the singular points of the differential equation via a rigorous integrator. From these computations, the monodromy matrices are derived, generating the monodromy group of the differential equation. This method establishes a mathematically rigorous framework for addressing the monodromy problem in differential equations. For a notable example, we apply our computer-assisted proof method to resolve the monodromy problem for a Picard--Fuchs differential equation associated with a family of K3 toric hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Characterizing perfectoid covers of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple characterization of all perfectoid profinite \'{e}tale covers of abelian varieties in terms of the Hodge-Tate filtration on the $p$-adic Tate module. We also compute the geometric Sen morphism for all profinite $p$-adic Lie torsors over an abelian variety, and combine this with our characterization to prove a conjecture of Rodr\'{i}guez Camargo on perfectoidness of $p$-adic Lie torsors in this case. We obtain complementary results for covers of semi-abeloid varieties, $p$-divisible rigid analytic groups, and varieties with globally generated 1-forms. Our proof of perfectoidness for covers of abelian varieties is based on results of Scholze on the canonical subgroup and holds for an arbitrary abelian variety over an algebraically closed non-archimedean extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In an appendix authored by Tongmu He, an alternate proof is presented in the case of abelian varieties that can be defined over a discretely valued subfield by combining our computation of the geometric Sen morphism with previous pointwise perfectoidness and purity of perfectoidness results of He.</description>

Abstract: We prove that various morphisms related to the six Grothendieck operations on sheaves become isomorphisms when restricted to (weakly) constructible sheaves. To this end, we first study some properties of weakly cohomologically constructible sheaves. We then deduce several compatibilities of the six operations in the context of (weakly) $\mathbb{R}$-constructible sheaves.</description>

Abstract: Mirror symmetry originally envisions a correspondence between deformations of the A-side and deformations of the B-side. In this paper, we achieve an explicit correspondence in the case of punctured surfaces.
  The starting point is the noncommutative mirror equivalence $ \operatorname{Gtl} Q \cong \operatorname{mf} (\operatorname{Jac} \check{Q}, \ell) $ for a punctured surface $ Q $. We pick a deformation $ \operatorname{Gtl}_q Q $ which captures a large part of the deformation theory and includes the relative Fukaya category. To find the corresponding deformation of $ \operatorname{mf} (\operatorname{Jac} \check{Q}, \ell) $, we deform work of Cho-Hong-Lau which interprets mirror symmetry as Koszul duality. As result we explicitly obtain the corresponding deformation $ \operatorname{mf} (\operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q}, \ell_q) $ together with a deformed mirror functor $ \operatorname{Gtl}_q Q \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{mf} (\operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q}, \ell_q) $.
  The bottleneck is to verify that the algebra $ \operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q} $ is indeed a (flat) deformation of $ \operatorname{Jac} \check{Q} $. We achieve this by deploying a result of Berger-Ginzburg-Taillefer on deformations of CY3 algebras, which however requires the relations to be homogeneous. We show how to replace this homogeneity requirement by a simple boundedness condition and obtain flatness of $ \operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q} $ for almost all $ Q $.
  We finish the paper with examples, including a full treatment of the 3-punctured sphere and 4-punctured torus. With the help of our computations in arXiv:2305.09112, we describe $ \operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q} $ explicitly. It turns out that the deformed potential $ \ell_q $ is still central in $ \operatorname{Jac}_q \check{Q} $, in contrast to the popular slogan that central elements do not survive under deformation.</description>

      <title>Remarks on gluing punctured logarithmic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider some well-behaved cases of the gluing formalism for punctured stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. This gives a gluing formula for log Gromov-Witten invariants in a diverse set of cases; in particular, the gluing formulae of Li-Ruan, Jun Li and Kim-Lho-Ruddat become an easy special case. The last section gives an application of this gluing formalism to canonical wall structures for K3 surfaces as constructed by Gross and Siebert in "The canonical wall structure and intrinsic mirror symmetry."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the morphisms from projective spaces to flag varieties. We show that the morphisms can only be constant under some special conditions. As a consequence, we prove that the splitting types of unsplit uniform $r$-bundles on $\mathbb{P}^m$ can not be $(a_1,\dots,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{r-k+1})$ for $1\le k\le m-2$.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>Fourier Quasicrystals on $\mathbb R^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has three aims. First, for $n \geq 1$ we construct a family of real-rooted trigonometric polynomial maps $P : \mathbb C^n \mapsto \mathbb C^n$ whose divisors are Fourier Quasicrystals (FQ). For $n = 1$ these divisors include the first nontrivial FQ with positive integer coefficients constructed by Kurasov and Sarnak [47, and for $n &gt; 1$ they overlap with Meyer's curved model sets [65] and two-dimensional [66] and multidimensional [67] crystalline measures. We prove that the divisors are FQ by directly computing their Fourier transforms using a formula derived in [50].. Second, we extend the relationship between real-rootedness and amoebas, derived for $n = 1$ by Alon, Cohen and Vinzant [1], to the case $n &gt; 1.$ The extension uses results in [10] about homology of complements of amoebas of algebraic sets of codimension $&gt; 1.$ Third, we prove that the divisors of all uniformly generic real-rooted $P$ are FQ. The proof uses the formula relating Grothendieck residues and Newton polytopes derived by Gelfond and Khovanskii [34]. Finally, we note that Olevskii and Ulanovskii [72] have proved that all FQ with positive integer weights are divisors of real-rooted trigonometric polynomials for $n = 1$ but that the situation for $n &gt; 1$ remains unsolved.</description>

      <title>On the functoriality of refined unramified cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalise the construction of the functorial pullback of refined unramified cohomology between smooth schemes, by following the ideas of Fulton's intersection theory and Rost's cycle modules. We also define standard actions of algebraic cycles on the refined unramified cohomology groups of smooth proper schemes avoiding Chow's moving lemma, which coincide with Schreieder's constructions for smooth projective schemes. As applications, we prove the projective bundle and blow-up formulas for refined unramified cohomology groups and we reduce the Rost nilpotence principle in characteristic zero to a statement concerning certain refined unramified cohomology groups. Moreover, we compute the refined unramified cohomology for smooth proper linear varieties and show that Rost's nilpotence principle holds for these varieties in characteristic zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let k be a field of characteristic not 2. We conjecture that if X is a quasi-projective k-variety with trivial motivic Euler characteristic, then Sym$^n$X has trivial motivic Euler characteristic for all n. Conditional on this conjecture, we show that the Grothendieck--Witt ring admits a power structure that is compatible with the motivic Euler characteristic and the power structure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties. We then discuss how these conditional results would imply an enrichment of G\"ottsche's formula for the Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with approximability (\`{a} la Neeman) and Rouquier dimension for triangulated categories associated to noncommutative algebras over schemes. Amongst other things, we establish that the category of perfect complexes of a Noetherian quasi-coherent algebra over a separated Noetherian scheme is strongly generated if, and only if, there exists an affine open cover where the algebra has finite global dimension. As a consequence, we solve an open problem posed by Neeman. Further, as a first application, we study the existence of generators for Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Irregular Hodge numbers of stacky Clarke mirror pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a duality between the graded pieces of the irregular Hodge filtration on the twisted cohomology for a large class of Clarke mirror pairs of stacky Landau-Ginzburg models. We use this to recover results of Batyrev--Borisov, generalize results of Ebeling-Gusein-Zade-Takahashi and Krawitz, and prove results similar to those of Gross-Katzarkov-Ruddat. We apply our results to prove a generalized version of a conjecture of Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev for orbifold toric complete intersections with nef anticanonical divisors and orbifold Fano stacks, and we prove the Hodge number duality result for orbifold log Calabi-Yau complete intersections. Along the way, we study the behaviour of twisted cohomology under degeneration and prove that for certain degenerations of toric Landau--Ginzburg models, irregular Hodge numbers admit a tropical realization.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Fano variety $X$, and $U$ an affine log Calabi-Yau variety given as the complement of an anticanonical divisor $D \subset X$, we prove that for any snc compactification $Y$ of $U$ dominating $X$ with $D' = Y\setminus U$, there exists an element $W_D \in R_{(Y,D')}$ of the intrinsic mirror algebra whose classical periods give the regularized quantum periods of $X$. Using this result, we deduce various corollaries regarding Fano mirror symmetry, in particular integrality of regularized quantum periods in large generality and the existence of Laurent mirrors to all Fano varieties whose mirrors contain a dense torus. When $U$ is an affine cluster variety satisfying the Fock-Goncharov conjecture, we use this result to produce a family of polytopes indexed by seeds of $U$ determined by enumerative invariants of the pair $(X,D)$ which give a family of Newton-Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations of $X$. Moreover, we give an explicit description of the superpotential in the Grassmanian setting, in particular recovering the Plucker coordinate mirror found by Marsh and Rietsch. Finally, we use the main result to show that the quantum period sequence is equivalent to all theta function structure constants for $R_{(X,D)}$ when $D$ is a smooth anticanonical divisor.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>

Abstract: To initiate a systematic study on the applications of perfectoid methods to Noetherian rings, we introduce the notions of perfectoid towers and their tilts. We mainly show that the tilting operation preserves several homological invariants and finiteness properties. Using this, we also provide a comparison result on \'etale cohomology groups under the tilting. As an application, we prove finiteness of the prime-to-$p$-torsion subgroup of the divisor class group of a local log-regular ring that appears in logarithmic geometry in the mixed characteristic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11446v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the 2-torus $\mathbb T$, an abelian linear algebraic group, is a fine moduli space of labeled, oriented, possibly-degenerate inscribable similarity classes of triangles, where a triangle is {\it inscribable} if it can be inscribed in a circle. A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines a quotient stack $[\mathbb T/D_6]$, which is the stack of absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) possibly-degenerate inscribable classes. We show the main triangle types form distinguished algebraic substructures: subgroups, cosets, and elements of small order, and we apply the natural metric on $\mathbb T$ to compare them.</description>

      <title>Marked points of families of hyperbolic automorphisms of smooth complex projective varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X\to \Lambda$ be a flat family of smooth complex projective varieties parameterized by a smooth quasi-projective variety $\Lambda$, and let $f: X\to X$ be a family of automorphisms with positive topological entropy. Suppose $\sigma : \Lambda \to X$ is a marked point, i.e., it is a rational section of $\pi$. We propose two methods to measure the stability, normality, or periodicity of the family given by $t \mapsto f_t^n(\sigma(t))$.
  First, from an algebraic perspective, we construct geometric canonical height functions that have desirable properties. Second, from an analytic viewpoint, we construct a positive closed $(1,1)$-current with continuous local potential. When $\Lambda$ is a curve, we demonstrate that these two constructions actually coincide, providing a unified approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of the family. As an application of the algebraic method, we prove a special case of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture over complex function fields.</description>
