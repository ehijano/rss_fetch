      <title>Liquidity Dynamics in RFQ Markets and Impact on Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To assign a value to a portfolio, it is common to use Mark-to-Market prices. However, how should one proceed when the securities are illiquid? When transaction prices are scarce, how can one use all the available real-time information? In this article, we address these questions for over-the-counter (OTC) markets based on requests for quotes (RFQs). We extend the concept of micro-price, which was recently introduced for assets exchanged through limit order books in the market microstructure literature, and incorporate ideas from the recent literature on OTC market making. To account for liquidity imbalances in RFQ markets, we use an approach based on bidimensional Markov-modulated Poisson processes. Beyond extending the concept of micro-price to RFQ markets, we introduce the new concept of Fair Transfer Price. Our concepts of price can be used to value securities fairly, even when the market is relatively illiquid and/or tends to be one-sided.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>
