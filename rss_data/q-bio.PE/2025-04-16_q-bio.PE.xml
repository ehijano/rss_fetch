      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are characterized by complex and poorly understood multiannual cycles, posing challenges for forecasting. Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction. More generally, our results emphasize the potential role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent Method for Tropical Principal Component Analysis over Tree Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against MCMC samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent works very well.</description>

      <title>Accurate stochastic simulation algorithm for multiscale models of infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the infectious disease literature, significant effort has been devoted to studying dynamics at a single scale. For example, compartmental models describing population-level dynamics are often formulated using differential equations. In cases where small numbers or noise play a crucial role, these differential equations are replaced with memoryless Markovian models, where discrete individuals can be members of a compartment and transition stochastically. Classic stochastic simulation algorithms, such as the next reaction method, can be employed to solve these Markovian models exactly. The intricate coupling between models at different scales underscores the importance of multiscale modelling in infectious diseases. However, several computational challenges arise when the multiscale model becomes non-Markovian. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing a novel exact stochastic simulation algorithm. We apply it to a showcase multiscale system where all individuals share the same deterministic within-host model while the population-level dynamics are governed by a stochastic formulation. We demonstrate that as long as the within-host information is harvested at a reasonable resolution, the novel algorithm will always be accurate. Furthermore, our implementation is still efficient even at finer resolutions. Beyond infectious disease modelling, the algorithm is widely applicable to other multiscale systems, providing a versatile, accurate, and computationally efficient framework.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregation-diffusion equations are foundational tools for modelling biological aggregations. Their principal use is to link the collective movement mechanisms of organisms to their emergent space use patterns in a concrete mathematical way. However, most existing studies do not account for the effect of the underlying environment on organism movement. In reality, the environment is often a key determinant of emergent space use patterns, albeit in combination with collective aspects of motion. This work studies aggregation-diffusion equations in a heterogeneous environment in one spatial dimension. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to find exact analytic expressions for the steady-state solutions when diffusion is quadratic. Minimising the associated energy functional across these solutions provides a rapid way of determining the likely emergent space use pattern, which can be verified via numerical simulations. This energy-minimisation procedure is applied to a simple test case, where the environment consists of a single clump of attractive resources. Here, self-attraction and resource-attraction combine to shape the emergent aggregation. Two counter-intuitive findings emerge from these analytic results: (a) a non-monotonic dependence of clump width on the aggregation width, (b) a positive correlation between self-attraction strength and aggregation width when the resource attraction is strong. These are verified through numerical simulations. Overall, the study shows rigorously how environment and collective behaviour combine to shape organism space use, sometimes in counter-intuitive ways.</description>

      <title>Spatial moment dynamics and biomass density equations provide complementary, yet limited, descriptions of pattern formation in individual-based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial patterning is common in ecological systems and has been extensively studied via different modeling approaches. Individual-based models (IBMs) accurately describe nonlinear interactions at the organism level and the stochastic spatial dynamics that drives pattern formation, but their computational cost scales quickly with system complexity, limiting their practical use. Population-level approximations such as spatial moment dynamics (SMD) -- which describe the moments of organism distributions -- and coarse-grained biomass density models have been developed to address this limitation. However, the extent to which these approximated descriptions accurately capture the spatial patterns and population sizes emerging from individual-level simulations remains an open question. We investigate this issue considering a prototypical population dynamics IBM with long-range dispersal and intraspecific competition, for which we derive both its SMD and coarse-grained density approximations. We systematically compare the performance of these two approximations at predicting IBM population abundances and spatial patterns. Our results highlight that SMD and density-based approximations complement each other by correctly capturing these two population features within different parameter regimes. Importantly, we identify regions of the parameter space in which neither approximation performed well, which should encourage the development of more refined IBM approximation approaches.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that pandemics can be contained cost-effectively if individuals take preventive actions when disease prevalence rises among their close contacts. However, assessing local awareness behavior in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Through the analysis of mutation patterns in clinical genetic sequence data, we propose an efficient approach to quantify the impact of local awareness by identifying superspreading events and assigning containment scores to them.
  We validate the proposed containment score as a proxy for local awareness in simulation experiments, and find that it was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in the containment score during the Omicron wave in the United Kingdom, matching a survey experiment we carried out in Hungary during the corresponding period of the pandemic. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>
