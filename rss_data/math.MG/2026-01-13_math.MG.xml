      <title>Radial measures of pseudo-cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $C$-pseudo-cones, that is, closed convex sets $K \subset{\mathbb R}^n$ with $o\notin K\subset C$, for which $C$ is the recession cone. Here $C$ is a given closed convex cone in ${\mathbb R}^n$, pointed and with nonempty interior. We define a class of measures for such pseudo-cones and show how they can be interpreted as derivative measures. For a subclass of these measures, namely for dual curvature measures with negative indices, we solve a Minkowski type existence problem.</description>

      <title>Rotation of a polytope in another one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the naive problem whether we can move a solid object in a solid box or not. We restrict move to rotation. In the case we can, the centre and the ``direction'' of rotation may be restricted. Simplifying, we consider possibility of rotation of a polytope within another one of the same dimension and give a criterion for the possibility. Consider the particular case of simplices of the same dimension assuming that the vertices of the inner simplex are contained in different facets of the outer one. Premising further that simplices are even dimensional, rotation is possible in a very general situation. However, in dimension 3, the possible case is not not general. Even in these elementary phenomena, the parity of the dimension seems to yield difference.</description>

      <title>Geometry of low nonnegative rank matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study completion of partial matrices with nonnegative entries to matrices of nonnegative rank at most $r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{N}$. Most of our results are for $r \leq 3$. We show that a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a nonnegative rank-1 completion if and only if it has a rank-1 completion. This is not true in general when $r \geq 2$. For $3 \times 3$ matrices, we characterize all the patterns of observed entries when having a rank-2 completion is equivalent to having a nonnegative rank-2 completion. If a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a rank-$r$ completion that is nonnegative, where $r \in \{1,2\}$, then it has a nonnegative rank-$r$ completion. We will demonstrate examples for $r=3$ where this is not true. We do this by introducing a geometric characterization for nonnegative rank-$r$ completion employing families of nested polytopes which generalizes the geometric characterization for nonnegative rank introduced by Cohen and Rothblum (1993).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-M\"obius maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce asymptotic-M\"obius (AM) maps, a large-scale analogue of quasi-M\"obius maps tailored to geometric group theory. AM-maps capture coarse cross-ratio behavior for configurations of points that lie far apart, providing a notion of "conformality at infinity" that is stable under quasi-isometries, compatible with scaling limits, and rigid enough to yield structural consequences absent from Pansu's notion of large-scale conformality. We establish basic properties of AM-maps, give several sources of examples, including quasi-isometries, sublinear bi-Lipschitz equivalences, snowflaking, and Assouad embeddings, and apply the theory to large-scale dimension and metric cotype. As applications we obtain dimension-monotonicity results for nilpotent groups and CAT(0) spaces, and new obstructions to the existence of AM-maps arising from metric cotype.</description>

      <title>Realising all countable groups as quasi-isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any countable group $G$, we construct uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of proper geodesic metric spaces with quasi-isometry group isomorphic to $G$. Moreover, if the group $G$ is a hyperbolic group, the spaces we construct are hyperbolic metric spaces.
  We make use of a rigidity phenomenon for quasi-isometries exhibited by many symmetric spaces, called strong quasi-isometric rigidity. Our method involves the construction of new examples of strongly quasi-isometrically rigid spaces, arising as graphs of strongly quasi-isometrically rigid rank-one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis and geometry of metric-measure structures in infinite dimensions, we study the category of extended metric-topological spaces, along with many of its distinguished subcategories (such as the one of compact spaces). One of the main achievements is the proof of the bicompleteness (i.e. of the existence of all small limits and colimits) of the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Strongly rigid metrics in spaces of metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric space is said to be strongly rigid if no positive distance is taken twice by the metric. In 1972, Janos proved that a separable metrizable space has a strongly rigid metric if and only if it is zero-dimensional. In this paper, we shall develop this result for the theory of space of metrics. For a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, we prove that the set of all strongly rigid metrics is dense in the space of metics. Moreover, if the space is the union of countable compact subspaces, then that set is comeager. As its consequence, we show that for a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, the set of all metrics possessing no nontrivial (bijective) self-isometry is comeager in the space of metrics.</description>

      <title>Kubota-type formulas and supports of mixed measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kubota's integral formula expresses the intrinsic volumes of a convex body as averages over its projections onto linear subspaces. In this work, we introduce a new class of Kubota-type formulas for mixed area measures adapted to rotations around a fixed axis, which encode a crucial disintegration property. Our construction is motivated by applications to valuations on convex functions. In the latter framework, we obtain corresponding statements for (conjugate) mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. As a by-product, we characterize supports of mixed area and mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures, thereby confirming a special case of a conjecture by Schneider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three dimensional Euclidean space, a raspberry is defined to be an arrangement of spheres with pairwise disjoint interiors, where all spheres are tangent to a central unit sphere and such that the contact graph of the non-central spheres triangulates the central sphere.
  We discuss the relevance of these structures in related work. We present a catalog of all configurations of radii that permit the formation of raspberries that have at most two sizes of non-central spheres. Throughout, we discuss the construction of this catalog.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first prove that for every metrizable space $X$, for every closed subset $F$ whose complement is zero-dimensional, the space $X$ can be embedded into a product space of the closed subset $F$ and a metrizable zero-dimensional space as a closed subset. Using this theorem, we next show the existence of extensors of metrics and ultrametrics, which preserve properties of metrics such as the completeness, the properness, being an ultrametrics, its fractal dimensions, and large scale structures. This result contains some of the author's extension theorems of ultrametrics.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes homotopy-type reconstruction guarantees for spaces with vanishing reach and $\mu$--reach, a regime not covered by existing sampling conditions.</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. The main results in this paper are (1) a construction of smaller spherical designs via an explicit connection to Gaussian designs and (2) the exact order of magnitude of minimal-size signed $t$-designs, which is significantly smaller than predicted by a typical degrees-of-freedom heuristic. We also establish a method to ``project'' spherical designs between dimensions, prove a variety of results on approximate designs, and construct new $t$-wise independent subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,q\}^d$ which may be of independent interest. To achieve these results, we combine techniques from algebra, geometry, probability, representation theory, and optimization.</description>
