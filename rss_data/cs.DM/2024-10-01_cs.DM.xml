      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation of Fractional Hypertree Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give two new approximation algorithms to compute the fractional hypertree width of an input hypergraph. The first algorithm takes as input $n$-vertex $m$-edge hypergraph $H$ of fractional hypertree width at most $\omega$, runs in polynomial time and produces a tree decomposition of $H$ of fractional hypertree width $O(\omega \log n \log \omega)$. As an immediate corollary this yields polynomial time $O(\log^2 n \log \omega)$-approximation algorithms for (generalized) hypertree width as well. To the best of our knowledge our algorithm is the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation algorithm for fractional hypertree width and (generalized) hypertree width, as opposed to algorithms that run in polynomial time only when $\omega$ is considered a constant. For hypergraphs with the bounded intersection property we get better bounds, comparable with that recent algorithm of Lanzinger and Razgon [STACS 2024].
  The second algorithm runs in time $n^{\omega}m^{O(1)}$ and produces a tree decomposition of $H$ of fractional hypertree width $O(\omega \log^2 \omega)$. This significantly improves over the $(n+m)^{O(\omega^3)}$ time algorithm of Marx [ACM TALG 2010], which produces a tree decomposition of fractional hypertree width $O(\omega^3)$, both in terms of running time and the approximation ratio.
  Our main technical contribution, and the key insight behind both algorithms, is a variant of the classic Menger's Theorem for clique separators in graphs: For every graph $G$, vertex sets $A$ and $B$, family ${\cal F}$ of cliques in $G$, and positive rational $f$, either there exists a sub-family of $O(f \cdot \log^2 n)$ cliques in ${\cal F}$ whose union separates $A$ from $B$, or there exist $f \cdot \log |{\cal F}|$ paths from $A$ to $B$ such that no clique in ${\cal F}$ intersects more than $\log |{\cal F}|$ paths.</description>

      <title>Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalization of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</description>

      <title>The Closed Geodetic Game: algorithms and strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geodetic closure of a set S of vertices of a graph is the set of all vertices in shortest paths between pairs of vertices of S. A set S of vertices in a graph is geodetic if its geodetic closure contains all the vertices of the graph. Buckley introduced in 1984 the idea of a game where two players construct together a geodetic set by alternately selecting vertices, the game ending when all vertices are in the geodetic closure. The Geodetic Game was then studied in 1985 by Buckley and Harary, and allowed players to select vertices already in the geodetic closure of the current set. We study the more natural variant, also introduced in 1985 by Buckley and Harary and called the Closed Geodetic Game, where the players alternate adding to a set S vertices that are not in the geodetic closure of S, until no move is available. This variant was only studied ever since for trees by Araujo et al. in 2024. We provide a full characterization of the Sprague-Grundy values of graph classes such as paths and cycles, of the outcomes of several products of graphs in function of the outcomes of the two graphs, and give polynomial-time algorithms to determine the Sprague-Grundy values of cactus and block graphs.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the spectrum of unimodular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.02209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular networks are a generalization of finite graphs in a stochastic sense. We prove a lower bound to the spectral radius of the adjacency operator and of the Markov operator of an unimodular network in terms of its average degree. This allows to prove an Alon-Boppana type bound for the largest eigenvalues in absolute value of large, connected, bounded degree graphs, which generalizes the Alon-Boppana theorem for regular graphs.
  A key step is establishing a lower bound to the spectral radius of a unimodular tree in terms of its average degree. Similarly, we provide a lower bound on the volume growth rate of an unimodular tree in terms of its average degree.</description>

      <title>A chiral aperiodic monotile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered "hat" aperiodic monotile mixes unreflected and reflected tiles in every tiling it admits, leaving open the question of whether a single shape can tile aperiodically using translations and rotations alone. We show that a close relative of the hat -- the equilateral member of the continuum to which it belongs -- is a weakly chiral aperiodic monotile: it admits only non-periodic tilings if we forbid reflections by fiat. Furthermore, by modifying this polygon's edges we obtain a family of shapes called Spectres that are strictly chiral aperiodic monotiles: they admit only chiral non-periodic tilings based on a hierarchical substitution system.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Total Domination, Separated Clusters, CD-Coloring: Algorithms and Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domination and coloring are two classic problems in graph theory. The major focus of this paper is the CD-COLORING problem which combines the flavours of domination and colouring. Let $G$ be an undirected graph. A proper vertex coloring of $G$ is a $cd-coloring$ if each color class has a dominating vertex in $G$. The minimum integer $k$ for which there exists a $cd-coloring$ of $G$ using $k$ colors is called the cd-chromatic number, $\chi_{cd}(G)$. A set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is a total dominating set if any vertex in $G$ has a neighbor in $S$. The total domination number, $\gamma_t(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a total dominating set of size $k$. A set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is a $separated-cluster$ if no two vertices in $S$ lie at a distance 2 in $G$. The separated-cluster number, $\omega_s(G)$, of $G$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a separated-cluster of size $k$.
  In this paper, first we explore the connection between CD-COLORING and TOTAL DOMINATION. We prove that CD-COLORING and TOTAL DOMINATION are NP-Complete on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$. We also study the relationship between the parameters $\chi_{cd}(G)$ and $\omega_s(G)$. Analogous to the well-known notion of `perfectness', here we introduce the notion of `cd-perfectness'. We prove a sufficient condition for a graph $G$ to be cd-perfect (i.e. $\chi_{cd}(H)= \omega_s(H)$, for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$) which is also necessary for certain graph classes (like triangle-free graphs). Here, we propose a generalized framework via which we obtain several exciting consequences in the algorithmic complexities of special graph classes. In addition, we settle an open problem by showing that the SEPARATED-CLUSTER is polynomially solvable for interval graphs.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithm and Faster Algorithm for Submodular Maximization subject to a Matroid Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, and present for it a deterministic non-oblivious local search algorithm that has an approximation guarantee of $1 - 1/e - \varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) and query complexity of $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(nr)$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $r$ is the rank of the matroid. Our algorithm vastly improves over the previous state-of-the-art $0.5008$-approximation deterministic algorithm, and in fact, shows that there is no separation between the approximation guarantees that can be obtained by deterministic and randomized algorithms for the problem considered. The query complexity of our algorithm can be improved to $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(n + r\sqrt{n})$ using randomization, which is nearly-linear for $r = O(\sqrt{n})$, and is always at least as good as the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>
