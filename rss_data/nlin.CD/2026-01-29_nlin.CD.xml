      <title>A paradox concerning the numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11220</link>

Abstract: Two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is predicted by traditional direct numerical simulation (DNS) using double precision arithmetic and a range of different time-steps. It is found that the the final flow type tends either to vortical flow or zonal flow, whose statistics are completely different. Notably, these two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step is reduced to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each turbulent flow type should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise exerts a huge influence on the final flow type and statistics of numerically simulated NS turbulence (i.e., turbulence governed by the NS equations) because the time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations, as a turbulence model per se, require all small stochastic disturbances for $t&gt;0$ to be negligible. This leads to a logical paradox in the underlying theory. Further investigations are recommended to reveal the essential differences between the exact solution of NS turbulence, numerical simulations of such NS turbulence, and the corresponding actual turbulence. It should be emphasized that NS turbulence is closely related to the fourth Millennium problem, and turbulence is an unsolved fundamental problem in classic mechanics. Hopefully this paradox would be helpful to deepen our understandings about the turbulence and the fourth Millennium problem.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos in bean- and peanut-shaped billiards</title>

Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean- and a peanut-shaped billiard. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions-a defining feature of chaos. Poincar\'e maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. We employ both statistical and dynamical measures to characterise quantum chaos. Statistical indicator includes nearest-neighbour spacing distribution, level spacing ratios, and spectral staircase function, while dynamical measures includes out-of-time-order correlators and spectral complexity. We also observe eigenfunction scarring in both the billiards.</description>

      <title>Time-varying sensitivity analysis for mixing in chaotic flows: a comparison study</title>

Abstract: Engineered injection and extraction systems that create chaotic advection are promising procedures for enhancing mixing between two species. Mixing efficiencies vary considerably, so carefully selecting the design parameters, like pumping rates, well locations, or operation times, is crucial. While numerous studies investigate the conditions required to achieve chaotic flow, sensitivity analyses addressing its impact on mixing have rarely been performed. However, selecting a suitable sensitivity analysis method depends on the underlying system and is often restricted by the computational cost, especially when considering complex, high-dimensional models. Moreover, the most appropriate metric to quantify mixing (e.g., plume area, peak concentration) can also be system-specific. We perform a time-varying sensitivity analysis on the mixing enhancement of two chaotic flow fields with different complexities. The rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow is parametrized using two or four hyperparameters, while the quadrupole flow utilizes 16 hyperparameters. We compare three global sensitivity analysis methods: Sobol indices, Morris scores, and a modification of the activity scores. We evaluate the temporal evolution of the sensitivity of the design parameters, compare the performance of the three methods, and highlight their potential in analyzing parameter interactions. The analysis of the RPM flow shows comparable sensitivities for all methods. Additionally, our numerical experiments show that Morris is the cheapest method, needing at most four times fewer model evaluations than Sobol to reach convergence. This motivates us to only use the computationally cheaper but as reliable Morris and activity scores on the 16-dimensional model, yielding again consistent results.</description>
