      <title>Thermodynamics and thermal stability of BTZ-ModMax black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a new interesting nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) model which is known as Modification Maxwell (ModMax) theory, we obtain an exact analytic BTZ black hole solution in the presence of a new NLED model and the cosmological constant. Then, by considering the obtained solution, we obtain Hawking temperature, entropy, electric charge, mass, and electric potential. We extract the first law of thermodynamics for the BTZ-ModMax black hole. We study thermal stability by evaluating the heat capacity (local stability) and Helmholtz free energy (global stability). By comparing the local and global stabilities, we find the common areas that satisfy the local and global stabilities, simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Weyl-invariant quadratic Einstein-Cartan gravity coupled to a scalar field and study the inflationary behaviour of the coupled system of the scalar field and the pseudoscalar associated with the Holst invariant. We find that the model is characterized by effective single-field inflation occurring at small field values and analyze its predictions which are in comfortable agreement with existing observations for a range of parameter values.</description>

      <title>Scalar emission from neutron star-black hole binaries in scalar-tensor theories with kinetic screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore scalar radiation from neutron star-black hole binaries in scalar-tensor theories with kinetic screening ($K$-essence). Using 3+1 numerical relativity simulations in the decoupling limit, we investigate scalar dipole and quadrupole radiation for different values of the strong coupling constant $\Lambda$. Our results show that kinetic screening effectively suppresses the scalar dipole radiation as $\Lambda$ decreases. This is validated by comparing to analytic predictions for the screening of dipole scalar emission, with which our numerical results show good agreement. However, our numerical simulations show that the suppression of scalar quadrupole radiation is less efficient, even when the screening radius exceeds the wavelength of the emitted radiation. In fact, the dependence of the scalar quadrupole amplitude on $\Lambda$ flattens out for the smallest $\Lambda$ that we can simulate, and the quadrupole amplitude is suppressed only by a factor $\lesssim 3$ relative to the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke case. Overall, our study shows that scalar quadrupole radiation from mixed binaries may be used to place constraints on $K$-essence theories with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Approximate helical symmetry in compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inspiral of a circular, non-precessing binary exhibits an approximate helical symmetry. The effects of eccentricity, precession, and radiation reaction break the exact symmetry. We estimate the failure of this symmetry using the flux of the BMS charge corresponding to helical symmetry carried away by gravitational waves. We analytically compute the helical flux for binaries moving on eccentric orbits and quasi-circular orbits without precession using post-Newtonian theory. The helical flux is non-vanishing at the 0PN order for eccentric orbits as expected. We analytically predict the helical flux to be at a relative 5PN order for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries. This prediction is compared with 113 quasi-circular non-precessing numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog. We find good agreement between analytical and numerical results for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries establishing that helical symmetry starts to break at 5PN for these binaries.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescences in Dense Environments Can Pose as in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration are attributed to compact binary coalescences happening in vacuum. However, the large merger rates observed suggest that matter environments likely play a significant role in the formation and evolution of compact binaries. Why have we not seen environmental effects in LVK signals? While matched-filtering remains the most effective technique for gravitational-wave searches, it comes with a burden: we might only observe signals that align with our (vacuum) expectations, potentially missing unexpected or unknown phenomena. Even more concerning is the possibility that environmental effects could mimic vacuum waveforms, introducing biases in parameter estimation and impacting population studies. Here, we use numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole mergers inside stellar envelopes to show that: (i) a \texttt{GW150914}-like event would be detected (with a false alarm rate smaller than $10^{-4}\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) using a template bank of vacuum waveforms, even when immersed in stellar material of density larger than $10^{7}\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$; (ii) environmental effects can pass routinely performed tests of vacuum General Relativity, while leading to considerable biases in parameter estimation; but (iii) phenomenological environment waveforms are effectual in detecting environmental effects and can resolve systematic biases.</description>

      <title>Scalable matched-filtering pipeline for gravitational-wave searches of compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As gravitational-wave observations expand in scope and detection rate, the data analysis infrastructure must be modernized to accommodate rising computational demands and ensure sustainability. We present a scalable gravitational-wave search pipeline which modernizes the GstLAL pipeline by adapting the core filtering engine to the PyTorch framework, enabling flexible execution on both Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Offline search results on the same 8.8 day stretch of public gravitational-wave data indicate that the GstLAL and the PyTorch adaptation demonstrate comparable search performance, even with float16 precision. Lastly, computational benchmarking results show that the GPU float16 configuration of the PyTorch adaptation executed on an A100 GPU can achieve a speedup factor of up to 169 times compared to GstLAL's performance on a single CPU core.</description>

      <title>Information retrieval from Euclidean path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review the information loss paradox in the spirit of the Euclidean path integral approach. First, we argue that there is a long debate about the information loss paradox, and the non-perturbative quantum gravitational wave function must include the clue to the paradox. The Euclidean path integral approach provides the best way to describe the wave function. From this wave function, we can notice that there are not only semi-classical but also non-perturbative contributions, which are highly suppressed but preserved information. Information retrieval will be sufficiently explained if such non-perturbative contributions must be dominated by the late time. We will show that there is sufficient evidence that this scenario can be realized in generic circumstances. Finally, we compare this scenario with alternative approaches. Also, we comment on some unresolved issues that need to be clarified.</description>

      <title>Weak Bending of Light by Rotating Regular Black Holes with Asymptotically Minkowski Core using the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the weak gravitational lensing phenomenon for a recently proposed rotating regular black hole with an asymptotically Minkowski core characterized by a sub-Planckian curvature was investigated. Using the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the deflection of light in the weak limit was computed by taking the black hole as a lens at a finite distance from both the source and the observer. It was shown that the weak deflection angle slightly differs between the prograde and retrograde motion but both eventually converge to 0 as b increases. Moreover, the deflection angle correction for Kerr classical black hole and this sort of rotating regular black hole is a decreasing function for large values of b. It was also shown that the weak deflection angle for this sort of regular black hole is similar to Bardeen and Hayward black hole given its corresponding values for the parameters $x$ and $n$</description>

      <title>Impact of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ Theory on the Stability of Compact Spherical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper examines the feasibility and stability of compact stars in the context of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ theory, where $\mathcal{Q}$ represents the non-metricity scalar. To achieve this objective, a static spherical line element is assumed in the interior region and the Schwarzschild spacetime is used in the exterior region of the star. The unknown constants are determined by using the Darmois junction conditions. We consider a specific model of this theory to investigate the viability of compact stars through various physical quantities such as matter contents, energy bounds, anisotropy and state parameters. The stability states for the stellar objects under consideration are determined by the speed of sound and adiabatic index, respectively. The resulting data indicate that the compact stars in this modified framework are physically viable and stable.</description>

      <title>ROXAS: a new pseudospectral non-linear code for general relativistic oscillations of fast rotating isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to increase their sensitivity in the kHz band where binary neutron star remnants are expected to emit. In this context, robust predictions of oscillation modes of the post-merger object are desirable. To that end, we present here our code \texttt{ROXAS} that is aimed at simulating isolated rotating neutron stars. It is based on our previously published formalism relying on primitive variables, along with the extended conformal-flatness condition formulation of Einstein equations. The equations are written under a well-balanced formulation. The code uses pseudospectral methods for both the metric and the hydrodynamics. Since standard test beds were already presented in a previous paper, we here mainly focus on presenting the numerical ingredients of \texttt{ROXAS}, as well as on the frequency extraction for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes. We compare our results with semi-analytic perturbative methods. Spherically symmetric modes are also recovered. The code currently supports fast, rigidly rotating isolated neutron stars, described with a cold equation of state. A notable feature of the code is its ability to follow the surface of the star at every step. It is very lightweight and can be run on office computers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of high order correction for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <title>Noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extended noncanonical warm inflation to the nonminimal derivative coupling scenario. The fundamental equations, including the evolution equations and the slow roll equations of this new framework, were derived. The enlarged damping term, which encompasses both gravitationally enhanced friction and thermal damping, resulted in a well overdamped inflationary process, ensuring that the slow roll approximations can be satisfactorily satisfied. A linear stability analysis corroborated the viability of this approach, yielding significantly relaxed slow roll conditions within the context of noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling. Subsequently, the density fluctuations in this new framework were analyzed, leading to approximately analytic results for the power spectrum, spectral index, and related quantities. Both the energy scale at horizon crossing and the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreased considerably because of the effects of thermal damping and nonminimal derivative coupling. The upper bound for field excursion remained safely sub-Planckian in this inflationary scenario. Thus we reached a successful and meaningful model to broad the scope of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Numerical-Relativity Calibration Uncertainty in Gravitational-Wave Modeling and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing sensitivity of current and upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) detectors poses stringent requirements on the accuracy of the GW models used for data analysis. If these requirements are not met, systematic errors could dominate over statistical uncertainties, hindering our ability to extract astrophysical and cosmological information, and conduct precise tests of General Relativity. In this work, we present a novel method to mitigate waveform-systematic errors, by incorporating and marginalizing over waveform-uncertainty estimates, which are modeled as probability distributions for the numerical-relativity calibration parameters of effective-one-body waveform models. By analyzing simulated GW signals of loud ``golden'' binary--black-hole systems, we show that our method significantly reduces biases in the recovered parameters, highlighting its potential to improve the robustness of GW parameter estimation with upcoming observing runs and next-generation ground-based facilities, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Spacetimes from Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Functional Renormalization Group approach we construct effective quantum spacetime geometries by self-consistently deforming the classical Schwarzschild-de Sitter black-hole solution. This involves studying how quantum corrections, driven by the running of the Newton's and cosmological constants modify the solution across the infrared and ultraviolet regimes. We show that these quantum modifications replace the Schwarzschild singularity with a milder conical one. Moreover, two new features emerge in the ultraviolet regime. First, we identify a phase transition between Anti-de Sitter/de Sitter spacetime occurring when the object's mass exceeds a first critical threshold. Second, we predict the formation of horizons once the object's mass exceeds a second threshold. Both thresholds are of the order of the Planck mass. Finally, we investigate the role of the anomalous dimension in the conformal sector of the theory.</description>

      <title>Alternative theory for the quantum black hole and the temperature of its quantum radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector (EMV) model, uncovering a novel vectorization mechanism driven by the competition between electromagnetic and vector fields. By utilizing a generalized coordinate transformation, we resolve previous divergences near the event horizon and significantly expand the domain of existence for vectorized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes (VRNBHs). Our results highlight the crucial role of a newly defined combined charge $ \sqrt{\tilde{Q}^2 + \tilde{P}^2} $, which encapsulates this competition and establishes a clear thermodynamic preference, and a more natural description of light rights for VRNBHs over standard Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. Moreover, we identify unique features in the light ring structure of VRNBHs, revealing deeper connections to multi-charge black holes and opening new avenues for observational signatures in effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the LISA massive black hole binary population via iterative kernel density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the properties of the astrophysical population of binary compact objects in the universe is a key science goal of gravitational wave detectors. This goal is hindered by the finite strain, frequency sensitivity and observing time of current and future detectors. This implies that we can in general observe only a selected subset of the underlying population, with limited event statistics, and also nontrivial observational uncertainties in the parameters of each event. In this work, we will focus on observations of massive black hole binaries with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). If these black holes grow from population III star remnants (``light seeds''), a significant fraction of the binary population at low masses and high redshift will be beyond LISA's observational reach; thus, selection effects have to be accounted for when reconstructing the underlying population. Here we propose an iterative, kernel density estimation (KDE)-based non-parametric method, in order to tackle these statistical challenges in reconstructing the astrophysical population distribution from a finite number of observed signals over total mass and redshift. We test the method against a set of simulated LISA observations in a light seed formation scenario. We find that our approach is successful at reconstructing the underlying astrophysical distribution in mass and redshift, except in parameter regions where zero or order(1) signals are observed.</description>

      <title>Modified Uncertainty Principle with Cosmological Constant: More Insights on Dark Energy and Chandrasekhar Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) removes the Chandrasekhar limit, which can be restored using a negative GUP parameter. This study indicates that observational phantom dark energy also requires an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) parameter with the opposite sign. Altering the signs of the GUP and EUP parameters without a physical rationale is questionable. We demonstrate that incorporating cosmological constant in a modified uncertainty principle (MUP) can address the sign change in GUP and EUP within a unified framework. The main advantage of MUP is that the sign change of the cosmological constant is acceptable and geometrically meaningful. To achieve this, we first derive a modified equation of state from the MUP framework and second test it with observational data for dark matter and dark energy. Importantly, the proposed MUP parameter, which is proportional to the cosmological constant with positive and negative signs, aligns with dark energy observations and restores the Chandrasekhar limit for stars. Finally, we will show that the Chandrasekhar mass limit provides an upper bound of \(\leq 10^{-32}{\rm m^{-2}}\) for the cosmological constant, consistent with the observational value of \(\Lambda_{\rm obs}=10^{-52}{\rm m^{-2}}\).</description>

      <title>Dynamical interiors of Black-Bounce spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Israel-Darmois junction conditions, we obtain a class of regular dynamical interiors to the recently proposed black-bounce spacetimes which regularises the Schwarzschild singularity by introducing a regularisation parameter. We show that a regularised Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker like interior geometry can not be matched smoothly with the exterior black-bounce spacetime through a timelike hypersurface, as there always exists a thin shell of non-zero energy-momentum tensor at the matching hypersurface. We obtain the expressions for the energy density and pressure of the thin shell energy-momentum tensor in terms of the regularisation parameter and derive an evolution equation for the scale factor of the interior geometry by imposing physical conditions on these components of the surface energy-momentum tensor. We also discuss the formation of the event horizon inside the interior in the case when the initial conditions are such that the situation describes a collapsing matter cloud. We elaborate upon the physical implications of these results.</description>

      <title>Incorporating waveform calibration error in gravitational-wave modeling and inference for SEOBNRv4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As gravitational wave (GW) detector networks continue to improve in sensitivity, the demand on the accuracy of waveform models which predict the GW signals from compact binary coalescences is becoming more stringent. At high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) discrepancies between waveform models and the true solutions of Einstein's equations can introduce significant systematic biases in parameter estimation (PE). These biases affect the inferred astrophysical properties, including matter effects, and can also lead to erroneous claims of deviations from general relativity, impacting the interpretation of astrophysical populations and cosmological parameters. While efforts to address these biases have focused on developing more precise models, we explore an alternative strategy to account for uncertainties in waveform models, particularly from calibrating an effective-one-body (EOB) model against numerical relativity (NR) data. We introduce an efficient method for modeling and marginalizing over waveform uncertainty in the SEOBNRv4 model, which captures the dominant $(2,2)$ mode for non-precessing quasi-circular binary black holes (BBHs). Our approach uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model amplitude and phase deviations in the Fourier domain. This method mitigates systematic biases in PE and increases posterior variance by incorporating a broader distribution of waveforms, consistent with previous findings. This study emphasizes the importance of incorporating waveform uncertainties in GW data analysis and presents a novel, practical framework to include these uncertainties in Bayesian PE for EOB models, with broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Prototype Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Recovery in the LISA Global Fit Residual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission poses a difficult parameter estimation challenge: the sources will be so dense in both time and frequency that they all must be fit simultaneously in a `global fit'. Successful tests of global fit efforts on synthetic datasets have been recently reported, recovering extra-galactic black hole mergers and galactic binaries, including the $\mathtt{GLASS}$ pipeline in arXiv:2301.03673. Injected stochastic sources, however, have so far been absent in these datasets. In this work we report our development of a stochastic search pipeline ready for inclusion in future tests of the global fit, capable of detecting or placing limits on a wide variety of possible cosmologically- and astrophysically-inspired SGWBs. The code uses short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs) to allow for inference despite the non-stationarity of the noise. We quote results using both purely synthetic confusion noise and two $\mathtt{GLASS}$ residuals, and quantify the impact of the residuals' non-gaussianity on injected signal recovery and on setting upper limits. We find that, if not properly mitigated, non-gaussianities can preclude setting accurate SGWB upper limits and lead to false detections. We also stress that the narrow-band non-gaussianities we find do not affect all sources equally, and many narrower-band, cosmologically-inspired SGWBs are more sensitive to non-gaussianity than others.</description>

      <title>Modulations of Gravitational Waves due to Non-static Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a new observational window into the universe, providing insights into compact objects and cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing, commonly studied in electromagnetic waves, also affects GWs, introducing magnification, time delays, and multiple images. While existing studies focus on static lenses, many astrophysical lenses are dynamic, with time-varying mass distributions such as moving stars or orbiting binaries. We develop a general theoretical framework to describe non-static lenses and demonstrate how they modulate GW signals, inducing unique time-varying amplitude modulations and spectral broadening. By examining uniformly moving and orbiting binary lenses, we show that these modulations provide new observational signatures, enhancing our understanding of lensing objects and the dynamics of the universe. Our findings have important implications for GW astronomy, offering novel ways to probe lens dynamics and improve the interpretations of GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the operational setting of a two-agent, local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocol, Alice and Bob cannot operationally distinguish monogamous entanglement from a topological identification of points in their respective local spacetimes, i.e. that ER = EPR can be recovered as an operational theorem. Our construction immediately implies that in this operational setting, the local topology of spacetime is observer-relative. It also provides a simple demonstration of the non-traversability of ER bridges. As our construction does not depend on an embedding geometry, it generalizes previous geometric approaches to ER = EPR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrices $\mathcal M$ with respect to a contour $\Gamma$. For the case that the quotient $q$ of the two diagonal elements of $\mathcal M$ is a rational function, we show that due to the symmetric nature of the matrix $\mathcal M$, the second column in each of the two matrix factors that arise in the factorisation is determined in terms of the first column in each of these matrix factors, by multiplication by a rational matrix, and we give a method for determining the second columns of these factors. We illustrate our method with two examples in the context of a Riemann-Hilbert approach to obtaining solutions to the Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on neutron star $f$-modes with a nonparametric equation of state representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the fundamental-mode ($f$-mode) oscillation frequencies of nonrotating neutron stars using a phenomenological Gaussian process model for the unknown dense-matter equation of state conditioned on a suite of gravitational-wave, radio and X-ray observations. We infer the quadrupolar $f$-mode frequency preferred by the astronomical data as a function of neutron star mass, with error estimates that quantify the impact of equation of state uncertainty, and compare it to the contact frequency for inspiralling neutron-star binaries, finding that resonance with the orbital frequency can be achieved for the coalescences with the most unequal mass ratio. For an optimally configured binary neutron star merger, we estimate the gravitational waveform's tidal phasing due to $f$-mode dynamical tides as $7^{+2}_{-3}$ rad at merger. We assess prospects for distinguishing $f$-mode dynamical tides with current and future-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Introducing Various Notions of Distances between Space-Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

      <title>A recent confirmation of the wide binary gravitational anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerning recent published studies exploring the presence or otherwise of a gravitational anomaly at low accelerations in wide binary stars
  as observed by the {\it Gaia} satellite, Cookson (2024) presents an interesting case. In that study, RMS values of binned relative internal
  velocities in 1D for wide binaries are compared to Newtonian predictions for that quantity, with the author concluding that the data presented
  show no indication of any inconsistency with Newtonian expectations. However, the comparison presented is critically
  flawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide binaries with mean total masses of 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This is larger than the 1.56 $M_{\odot}$
  value which applies to the data used in said paper. In this short note we correct the error mentioned above and show that the data and error bars
  as given in Cookson (2024) are in fact inconsistent with Newtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion by Cookson, the data presented in Cookson
  (2024) actually show a clear anomaly in the low acceleration gravitational regime, this being consistent with a number of independent studies yielding
  this same result. Based on the analysis by Cookson (2024), wide binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from Newtonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quintessence: an analytical study, with theoretical and observational applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytical expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Turning to the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytical bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

These local effects have led to wormhole solutions in a semiclassical setting, but it has also been claimed that the noncommutative effects can be implemented by modifying only the energy momentum tensor in the Einstein field equations, while leaving the Einstein tensor unchanged. The implication is that noncommutative-geometry wormholes could be macroscopic. This result can be readily explained by considering the noncommutative-geometry background to be a fundamental property and the macroscopic wormhole spacetime to be emergent, according to an earlier version of this paper. However, it is shown in the present version that such wormholes could not be sufficiently massive to exist on a macroscopic scale. A major objective in this paper is to invoke $f(Q)$ gravity to provide the extra degrees of freedom to overcome these obstacles.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the CMB angular power spectrum obtained using the \texttt{CAMB} code for three different models of inflation: the Starobinsky inflationary model, the generalized Starobinsky inflationary model, and the chaotic inflationary model with a step. The results are compared with the most recent data reported for the Planck mission. An analysis of the large ($\ell \lesssim 90$), intermediate ($90 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 900$), and small ($\ell \gtrsim 900 $) angular scales is performed. We report the position of the peaks in the intermediate region so as the cosmological parameters obtained in each of the models: age of the universe, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, $\Omega_K$ and $n_\sca$. We also perform a Bayesian analysis using the \texttt{Cobaya} code to evaluate our three best-fitting models. Additionally, we generated contour plots $(n_\sca,r)$ for our inflationary models, taking into account the number of e-folds between the end of inflation and the completion of reheating.</description>

      <title>The classical-quantum hybrid canonical dynamics and its difficulties with special and general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian hybrid coupling between a classical and a quantum subsystem. If applicable to classical gravity coupled to quantized matter, this hybrid theory might realize a captivating `postquantum' alternative to full quantum-gravity. We summarize the nonrelativistic hybrid dynamics in improved formalism adequate to Hamiltonian systems. The mandatory decoherence and diffusion terms become divergent in special and general relativistic extensions. It is not yet known if any renormalization method might reconcile Markovian decoherence and diffusion with relativity. Postquantum gravity could previously only be realized in the Newtonian approximation. We argue that pending problems of the recently proposed general relativistic postquantum theory will not be solved if Markovian diffusion/decoherence are truly incompatible with relativity.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravitating Matter in Stationary and Axisymmetric Black Hole Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All black holes (BHs) in nature are expected to be described by the Kerr vacuum solution of general relativity (GR). However, the Kerr BH interior contains several problematic features such as a Cauchy horizon, a curvature singularity, and a causality-violating region. Non-Kerr BH models, which are used to examine the genericity of these features, typically contain nontrivial matter content. When such matter is minimally-coupled to Einstein-Hilbert gravity, the Einstein equations can be directly used to investigate its physical properties. We examine properties of the matter in a broad class of stationary and axisymmetric, geodesically-integrable BH spacetimes, and how they are linked to features of the spacetime geometry. In these spacetimes, we find the matter to typically flow along timelike Killing orbits in the BH exterior, usually exhibiting differential rotation but sometimes additionally also non-rigid rotation. At a horizon, the matter rest-frame energy density, $\epsilon$, and principal normal pressure, $p_n$, are shown to necessarily satisfy $p_n = -\epsilon$, implying that only specific types of matter can thread stationary event horizons (e.g., electromagnetic fields but not massless real scalar fields). Furthermore, we show the matter to be comoving with the interior cosmology. We also obtain simple expressions for the expansions of the ingoing and outgoing zero angular momentum null congruences and comment on the light-focussing behavior of the cosmology. Finally, we verify above results explicitly by working with a representative set of well-known BH spacetimes which contain various types of matter -- scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, anisotropic fluids. Some spacetimes have singularities while others have regular interiors. In the exterior, the matter satisfies the weak energy condition. The framework developed here can be extended to cover more general spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

Abstract: A mathematical model of the Universe evolution, based on asymmetric doublet of classical and phantom dcalar Higgs fields with a kinetic connection between the components, has been constructed and studied. A detailed qualitative analysis was carried out, the properties of the model's symmetry and invarience with respect to the similariry transformations of fundamental constants were proven. The principles of numerical modeling are formulated and an example of numerical modeling of the evolution of the model for a specific set of fundamental constants and initial conditions is given. the asymptotic behavior of the model near cosmological singularities is studied. It is shown that cosmological model near singularities manifests itself as an ideal fluid with an extremelly ripid equation of state. Keywords: cosmological model, phantom and classical scalar fields, kinetic interection, quality analysis, asymptotic behavior, numerrical modeling.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantum backreaction in U(1) axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum backreaction due to a gauge field coupled to a pseudo-scalar field driving a slow-roll inflationary stage, the so-called axion inflation. The backreaction is evaluated for the first time using a gauge invariant approach, going to second order in perturbation theory, and taking into consideration inflaton fluctuations as well as scalar perturbations of the metric. Within our gauge-invariant, but observer-dependent approach, we naturally consider as physical observers the ones comoving with the inflaton field. Considering the effective expansion rate consequent to the gauge field's backreaction, we observe that the backreaction effect becomes significant quite rapidly, moving the system out of the perturbative regime and into what is often referred to as the strong backreaction regime. This behavior also applies to the parameter that dictates the production of the gauge fields. The space-time backreaction is mainly due to the helicity contribution within the region of validity of the perturbative regime. As a final result, we see that the evaluated backreaction goes in the direction of prolonging the inflationary period more compared to the scenarios previously studied.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Merger Rate with Modified Gravity in Dark-Matter Spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark-matter spikes surrounding super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions, Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH-PBH and PBH-NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark-matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO-Virgo observations to constrain the parameters of the theory. In particular we find steeper dark-matter spike density profiles in the modified gravity scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models are found to be wider than by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results on the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties in making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result on PBH properties.</description>

      <title>Choice of vacuum state and the relation between inflationary and Planck scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations about the cosmic microwave background evidence a clear discrepancy between the scale of inflation and the Planck scale expected in the conventional inflationary picture, based on simple chaotic inflationary models. This paper explores a possible resolution of this conflict by considering a slight modification of the standard general relativity scenario, which naturally incorporates a cutoff scale consistent with the observations. This last scale of power suppression appears by the combined effect of the preinflationary background dynamics and an associated initial vacuum state for the cosmological perturbations which differs from the conventional Bunch-Davies state of slow-roll inflation. We revise and correct previous discussions in the literature about the relation between this scale and the scale corresponding to the onset of inflation. The mechanism that produces this cutoff is intimately related to the criterion determining a privileged vacuum state for the primordial perturbations. We adhere to a recent proposal based on an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the perturbations and leading to a non-oscillatory primordial power spectrum. With this choice, we are able to investigate analytically the model, studying in detail some physically interesting cases. These analytic calculations provide further support to our arguments about the relation between the different scales of the system.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological models based on an asymmetric scalar Higgs doublet (canonical $\Phi$ and phantom $\phi$ fields) with potential interaction between the components are proposed. A qualitative analysis of the corresponding dynamic systems is performed and their transformation properties with respect to similarity transformations of fundamental constants are revealed. Asymptotic behavior of this class of cosmological models near cosmological singularities is investigated. Numerical simulations revealed a number of interesting features of these models, in particular, the possibility of a fairly long ``waiting phase'', during which the Universe is almost Euclidean, as well as the presence of bounce points, in the vicinity of which strong oscillations of scalar potentials occur. Keywords: Asymmetric scalar Higgs doublet, cosmological models, qualitative analysis, asymptotic behavior, waiting phase, bounces.</description>

      <title>On the Holographic Dual of a Topological Symmetry Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of a topological symmetry operator in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Symmetry operators arise from topological field theories localized on a subspace of the boundary CFT spacetime. We use bottom up considerations to construct the topological sector associated with their bulk counterparts. In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes. These considerations also motivate us to consider for general QFTs (holographic or not) the notion of lower-form symmetries, namely, $(-m)$-form symmetries for $m \geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galilean and Carrollian algebras acting on two-dimensional Newton-Cartan and Carrollian manifolds are isomorphic. A consequence of this property is a duality correspondence between one-dimensional Galilean and Carrollian fluids. We describe the dynamics of these systems as they emerge from the relevant limits of Lorentzian hydrodynamics, and explore the advertised duality relationship. This interchanges longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the flow velocity, and permutes equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium observables, unveiling specific features of Carrollian physics. We investigate the action of local hydrodynamic-frame transformations in the Galilean and Carrollian configurations, i.e. dual Galilean and Carrollian local boosts, and comment on their potential breaking. Emphasis is laid on the additional geometric elements that are necessary to attain complete systems of hydrodynamic equations in Newton-Cartan and Carroll spacetimes. Our analysis is conducted in general Cartan frames as well as in more explicit coordinates, specifically suited to Galilean or Carrollian use.</description>

Abstract: We study non-SUSY CFTs that are marginal deformations of $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ SCFTs in 4d. We explore the fate of integrability and/or non-integrability in these CFTs using the techniques of factorisation of scattering amplitudes in 2d sigma models. We show possibilities for the factorisation of scattering amplitudes in the absence of flavour D6 branes which rules out non-integrability in the dual non-SUSY CFTs.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>

Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>
