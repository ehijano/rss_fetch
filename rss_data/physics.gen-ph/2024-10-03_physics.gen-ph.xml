      <title>Defining geometric gauge theory to accommodate particles, continua, and fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theory underpins the quantum field theories of the standard model, and in a previous paper was shown via a geometric approach to describe classical electromagnetism in a form which approximates QED. Here we formalize and generalize the notion of a geometric gauge theory, then apply this framework to classical physical models, including an improved Lagrangian for matter field electromagnetism. We find a remarkably consistent series of actions, with straightforward limits under which each previous one may be obtained. Ancillary benefits include a gauge-independent Galilean Lagrangian, a geometric interpretation for the unusual metric dependence of four-momentum, a modern treatment of the effects of worldline variation on the four-current, a gauge theory of gravity which includes a matter field, and consistent units for matter field electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Vortex-bubble system as a spin acoustic particle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vortices-bubble system may be depicted by some features which may lead to infer its acoustic charge and its spin angular momentum. We study the dynamics of this system within the framework of fluid physics and with the help of Maxwell's hydrodynamic equations. Since we will adopt an approach of a fluid without viscosity and without gravity, then the fluid is in steady state if also we will neglect the acoustic radiation. When we expressed the energy (the kinetic and potential energy) of the vortex-bubble system we found out that the state of bubble which is captured in the core of the vortex is more stable than it is out of the core. For the above allegations we consider that this system, namely a vortex-bubble system, is a good approach for an acoustic particle with charge and spin angular momentum. This system owns to the Acoustic World.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm on two-way quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-way quantum computing (2WQC) represents a novel approach to quantum computing that introduces a CPT version of state preparation. This paper analyses the influence of this approach on Grover's algorithm and compares the behaviour of typical Grover and its 2WQC version in the presence of noise in the system. Our findings indicate that, in an ideal scenario without noise, the 2WQC Grover algorithm exhibits a constant complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. In the presence of noise, the 2WQC Grover algorithm demonstrates greater resilience to different noise models than the standard Grover's algorithm.</description>
