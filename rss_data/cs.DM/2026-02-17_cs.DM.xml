      <title>Majority Boolean networks classifying density: structural characterization and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of entities each holding a Boolean state, the Density Classification Task (DCT) asks them to converge to the most represented state. Given a directed graph of entities where each node synchronously updates to the local majority among its in-neighbors, we characterize in terms of three forbidden patterns when it solves DCT, and show that discovering these patterns is complete for NP and PSPACE.</description>

      <title>FO and MSO Model Checking on Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic meta-theorems provide an important tool for showing tractability of graph problems on graph classes defined by structural restrictions. While such results are well established for static graphs, corresponding frameworks for temporal graphs are comparatively limited.
  In this work, we revisit past applications of logical meta-theorems to temporal graphs and develop an extended unifying logical framework. Our first contribution is the introduction of logical encodings for the parameters vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width and tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, parameters which capture the signature of vertex and component activity over time. Building on this, we extend existing monadic second-order (MSO) meta-theorems for bounded lifetime and temporal degree to the parameters VIM and TIM width, and establish novel first-order (FO) meta-theorems for all four parameters.
  Finally, we signpost a modular lexicon of reusable FO and MSO formulas for a broad range of temporal graph problems, and give an example. This lexicon allows new problems to be expressed compositionally and directly yields fixed-parameter tractability results across the four parameters we consider.</description>

      <title>A group structure arising from Grover walks on complete graphs with self-loops and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a group-theoretic framework to analyze the algebraic structure of the Grover walk on a complete graph with self-loops. We construct a group generated by the Grover matrix and a diagonal matrix whose entries are powers of a complex root of unity. We then characterize the resulting quotient group, which is defined using a subgroup formed by commutators involving these matrices. We show that this quotient group is isomorphic to a finite cyclic group whose structure depends on the parity of the number of vertices. This group-theoretic characterization reveals underlying symmetries in the time evolution of the Grover walk and provides an algebraic framework for understanding its periodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Internally-disjoint directed pendant Steiner trees with three terminal vertices in Cartesian product digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D=(V(D),A(D))$ be a digraph with a terminal vertex subset $S\subseteq V(D)$ such that $|S|=k\geq 2$. An out-tree $T$ of $D$ rooted at $r$ is called a directed pendant $(S,r)$-Steiner tree (or, pendant $(S,r)$-tree for short) if $r\in S\subseteq V(T)$ and $d_{T}^{+}(r)=d_{T}^{-}(u)=1$ for each $u\in S\backslash \{r\}$. Two pendant $(S,r)$-trees $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are internally-disjoint if $A(T_{1})\cap A(T_{2})=\varnothing$ and $V(T_{1})\cap V(T_{2})=S$. The pendant-tree $k$-connectivity $\tau_{k}(D)$ of $D$ is defined as $$\tau_{k}(D)=\min\{\tau_{S,r}(D)\mid S\subseteq V(D),|S|=k,r\in S\},$$ where $\tau_{S,r}(D)$ denotes the maximum number of pairwise internally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees in $D$.
  In this paper, we derive a sharp lower bound for the pendant-tree 3-connectivity of the Cartesian product digraph $D\square H$, where $D$ and $H$ are both strong digraphs. Specifically, we prove the lower bound $\tau_{3}(D\square H)\geq \tau_{3}(D)+\tau_{3}(H)$. Moreover, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for finding internally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees which attain this lower bound.</description>

      <title>Word-Representation of Melon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of word-representable graphs is a generalization of comparability graphs, in which graphs are represented by words. The complexity of word-representation of a word-representable graph is captured through the representation number, whereas the corresponding concept is the permutation-representation number for comparability graphs. The graphs with the (permutation-)representation number at most two were characterized in the literature. While certain examples in the class of graphs with the (permutation-)representation number three are known, no characterization for these classes is available. In this work, we prove that the representation number of melon graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of melon graphs restricted to comparability graphs and show that their permutation-representation number is also at most three. Moreover, this work characterizes the word-representable line graphs of melon graphs and establishes that their representation number is at most three.</description>

      <title>Graph Homomorphisms and Universal Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems are computational problems that naturally appear in many areas of theoretical computer science. One of the central themes is their computational complexity, and in particular the border between polynomial-time tractability and NP-hardness. In this course we introduce the universal-algebraic approach to study the computational complexity of finite-domain CSPs. The course covers in particular the cyclic terms and bounded width theorems. To keep the presentation accessible, we start the course in the tangible setting of directed graphs and graph homomorphism problems.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Tractability of Packing Vertex-Disjoint A-Paths with Length Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph G and a set A \subseteq V(G), an A-path is a path in G that starts and ends at two distinct vertices of A with intermediate vertices in V(G) \setminus A. An A-path is called an (A,\ell)-path if the length of the path is exactly \ell. In the {\sc (A, \ell)-Path Packing} problem (ALPP), we seek to determine whether there exist k vertex-disjoint (A, \ell)-paths in G or not. We pursue this problem with respect to structural parameters. We prove that ALPP is W[1]-hard when it is parameterized by the combined parameter distance to path (dtp) and |A|. In addition, we consider the combined parameters distance to cluster (cvd) + |A| and distance to cluster (cvd) + \ell. For both these combined parameters, we provide FPT algorithms. Finally, we consider the vertex cover number (vc) as the parameter and provide a kernel with O(vc^2) vertices.</description>

      <title>An improvement on the bound for the acyclic chromatic index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acyclic chromatic index (or acyclic edge-chromatic number) of a graph is the least number of colors needed to properly color its edges so that none of its cycles has only two colors. We show that for a graph of max degree $\Delta$, the acyclic chromatic index is at most $3.142(\Delta-1)+1$, improving on the (best to date) bound of Fialho et al. (2020). Our improvement is made possible by considering unordered (non-plane) trees, instead of ordered (plane) ones, as witness structures for the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma, a key combinatorial tool often used in related works. The counting of these witness structures entails methods of Analytic Combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Automaticity of spacetime diagrams generated by cellular automata on commutative monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure: for instance Pascal's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle. It has been shown that such patterns can occur when the alphabet is endowed with the structure of an Abelian group, provided the cellular automaton is a morphism with respect to this structure and the initial configuration has finite support. The spacetime diagram then has a property related to k-automaticity. We show that these conditions can be relaxed: the Abelian group can be a commutative monoid, the initial configuration can be k-automatic, and the spacetime diagrams still exhibit the same regularity.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimizers: Improving Training with One Line of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{one-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only consistent speed-up on LLM pretraining, but also image classification, with minimum extra tuning on hyperparameters. Code is available at https://github.com/kyleliang919/C-Optim.</description>

      <title>Identifying faulty edges in resistive electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>
