      <title>Holomorphic Yang-Mills fields on $B$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the $B$-branes over a complex manifold $Y$ as objects of the bounded derived category $D^b(Y)$, we define holomorphic gauge fields on $B$-branes and the Yang-Mills functional for these fields.These definitions are a generalization to $B$-branes of concepts that are well known in the context of vector bundles. Given ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet}\in D^b(Y),$ we show that the Atiyah class $$a({\mathscr F}^{\bullet})\in{\rm Ext}^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet},\,\Omega^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet}))$$ is the obstruction to the existence of gauge fields on ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet}.$ When $Y$ be either the projective space ${\mathbb P}^n$ or the variety of complete flags in ${\mathbb C}^3,$ we prove that the cardinal of the set of holomorphic gauge fields on any $B$-brane over $Y$ is $\leq 1.$ We prove that the set of Yang-Mills fields on the $B$-brane ${\mathscr F}^{\bullet},$ if it is nonempty, is in bijective correspondence with the points of an algebraic subset of ${\mathbb C}^m$ defined by $m$ polynomial equations of degree $\leq 3$, where $m={\rm dim}\,{\rm Ext}^0({\mathscr F}^{\bullet},\,\Omega^1({\mathscr F}^{\bullet})).$</description>

      <title>Constructing prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds of codimension four via key varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^2$-fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous papers [Tak8,Tak6], we construct the affine varieties $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ whose partial projectivizations have $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations. In this paper, we produce prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds of anticanonical codimension 4 belonging to 23 (resp. 8) classes of Graded Ring Database [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of weighted projectivizations of $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ (resp. $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ or the cone over it). Together with the results of [CD] and [Tak5], prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds of anticanonical codimension 4 are constructed for 141 classes among the 143 classes in [GRDB].</description>

      <title>The Moduli Space of Acute Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an introduction to the concept of "moduli space" we consider the moduli space of similarity classes of acute and right triangles in the plane. This has a map to the moduli space of elliptic curves which is onto and generically three-to-one. The reason is that from any acute or right triangle we can construct an elliptic curve, and every elliptic curve is isomorphic to one constructed this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier article~\cite{CanSakran} we initiated a study of the complement-finite submonoids of the group of integer points of a unipotent linear algebraic group. In the present article, we continue to develop tools and techniques for analyzing our monoids. In particular, we initiate a theory of ideals for unipotent numerical monoids.</description>

      <title>On the vanishing of the hyperdeterminant under certain symmetry conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vector space $V$ over a field $\K$ whose characteristic is coprime with $d!$, let us decompose the vector space of multilinear forms $V^*\otimes\overset{\text(d)}{\ldots}\otimes V^*=\bigoplus _\lambda W_\lambda(X,\K)$ according to the different partitions $\lambda$ of $d$, i.e. the different representations of $S_d$. In this paper we first give a decomposition $W_{(d-1,1)}(V,\K)=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d-1}W_{(d-1,1)}^i(V,\K)$. We finally prove the vanishing of the hyperdeterminant of any $F\in(\bigoplus_{\lambda\ne(d),(d-1,1)})\oplus W_{(d-1,1)}^i(V,\K)$. This improves the result in [10] and [1], where the same result was proved without this new last summand.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of slope-semistable sheaves with reflexive Seshadri graduations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moduli stacks of slope-semistable torsion-free coherent sheaves that admit reflexive, respectively locally free, Seshadri graduations on a smooth projective variety. We show that they are open in the stack of coherent sheaves and that they admit good moduli spaces when the field characteristic is zero. In addition, in the locally free case we prove that the resulting moduli space is a quasi-projective scheme.</description>

      <title>On the numerical Terao's conjecture and Ziegler pairs for line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a smallest possible counterexample to the Numerical Terao's Conjecture in the class of line arrangements in the complex projective plane. Our example consists of a pair of two arrangements with $13$ lines. Moreover, we use the newly discovered singular matroid realization spaces to construct new examples of pairs of line arrangements having the same underlying matroid but different free resolutions of the Milnor algebras. Such rare arrangements are called Ziegler pairs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hilali conjecture and complex algebraic varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simply connected topological space is called \emph{rationally elliptic} if the rank of its total homotopy group and its total (co)homology group are both finite. A well-known Hilali conjecture claims that for a rationally elliptic space its homotopy rank \emph{does not exceed} its (co)homology rank. In this paper, after recalling some well-known fundamental properties of a rationally elliptic space and giving some important examples of rationally elliptic spaces and rationally elliptic singular complex algebraic varieties for which the Hilali conjecture holds, we give some revised formulas and some conjectures. We also discuss some topics such as mixd Hodge polynomials defined via mixed Hodge structures on cohomology group and the dual of the homotopy group, related to the ``Hilali conjecture \emph{modulo product}", which is an inequality between the usual homological Poincar\'e polynomial and the homotopical Poincar\'e polynomial.</description>

      <title>On close fields and the local Langlands correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Fargues-Scholze's semisimplified local Langlands correspondence (for quasisplit groups) with $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-coefficients is compatible with Deligne and Kazhdan's philosophy of close fields. From this, we deduce that the same holds with $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-coefficients after restricting to wild inertia, addressing questions of Gan-Harris-Sawin and Scholze. The proof involves constructing a moduli space of nonarchimedean local fields and then extending Fargues-Scholze's work to this context.</description>

      <title>Rational fibered cubic fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.10182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some classes of cubic fourfolds are birational to fibrations over $P^2$, where the fibers are rational surfaces. This is the case for cubics containing a plane (resp. an elliptic ruled surface), where the fibers are quadric surfaces (resp. del Pezzo sextic surfaces). It is known that the rationality of these cubic hypersurfaces is related to the rationality of these surfaces over the function field of $P^2$ and to the existence of rational (multi)sections of the fibrations. We study, in the moduli space of cubic fourfolds, the intersection of the divisor $C_{8}$ (resp. $C_{18}$) with $C_{14}$, $C_{26}$ and $C_{38}$, whose elements are known to be rational cubic fourfolds. We provide descriptions of the irreducible components of these intersections and give new explicit examples of rational cubics fibered in (quartic, quintic) del Pezzo surfaces or in quadric surfaces over $P^2$. We also investigate the existence of rational sections for these fibrations. Under some mild assumptions on the singularities of the fibers, these properties can be translated in terms of Brauer classes on certain surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand on an idea of Vinberg to take a tensor space and the natural Lie algebra that acts on it and embed their direct sum into an auxiliary algebra. Viewed as endomorphisms of this algebra, we associate adjoint operators to tensors. We show that the group actions on the tensor space and on the adjoint operators are consistent, which means that the invariants of the adjoint operator of a tensor, such as the Jordan decomposition, are invariants of the tensor. We show that there is an essentially unique algebra structure that preserves the tensor structure and has a meaningful Jordan decomposition. We utilize aspects of these adjoint operators to study orbit separation and classification in examples relevant to tensor decomposition and quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Chai's conjecture on the additivity of the base change conductor of semiabelian varieties in the case of Jacobians of proper curves. This includes the first infinite family of non-trivial wildly ramified examples. Along the way, we extend Raynaud's construction of the N\'eron lft-model of a Jacobian in terms of the Picard functor to arbitrary seminormal curves (beyond which Jacobians admit no N\'eron lft-models, as shown by our more general structural results). Finally, we investigate the structure of Jacobians of (not necessarily geometrically reduced) proper curves over fields of degree of imperfection at most one and prove two conjectures about the existence of N\'eron models and N\'eron lft-models due to Bosch-L\"utkebohmert-Raynaud for Jacobians of general proper curves in the case of perfect residue fields, thus strengthening the author's previous results in this situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Baldi-Klingler-Ullmo, we provide a general sufficient criterion for the existence and analytic density of typical Hodge loci associated to a polarizable $\mathbb{Z}$-variation of Hodge structures $\mathbb{V}$. Our criterion reproves the existing results in the literature on density of Noether-Lefschetz loci. It also applies to understand Hodge loci of subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$ . For instance, we prove that for $g \geq 4$, if a subvariety $S$ of $\mathcal{A}_g$ has dimension at least $g$ then it has an analytically dense typical Hodge locus. This applies for example to the Torelli locus of $\mathcal{A}_g$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the formalism of derived divided power algebras, and revisit the theory of derived De Rham and derived crystalline cohomology in this framework. We characterize derived De Rham cohomology of a derived commutative algebra $A$ over a base $R$, together with the Hodge filtration on it, in terms of the universal property as the largest filtered divided power thickening of $A$. We show that our approach recovers the classical De Rham cohomology in the case of a smooth map $R\rightarrow A$, and therefore in general, recovers the derived De Rham cohomology in the sense of Illusie. Along the way, we develop some generalities on square-zero extensions and derivations in derived algebraic geometry and apply them to give the universal property of the first Hodge truncation of the derived De Rham cohomology. Finally, we define derived crystalline cohomology relative to a general divided power base, show that it satisfies the main properties of the crystalline cohomology and coincides with the classical crystalline cohomology in the smooth case.</description>

Abstract: The Floer cohomology and the Fukaya category are not defined in general. Indeed, while the issue of obstructions can be theoretically addressed by introducing bounding cochains, the actual existence of even one such bounding cochain is usually unknown. This paper aims to deal with the problem. We study certain non-archimedean analytic structure that enriches the Maurer-Cartan theory of bounding cochains. Using this rigid structure and family Floer techniques, we prove that within a connected family of graded Lagrangian submanifolds, if any one Lagrangian is unobstructed (in a slightly stronger sense), then all remaining Lagrangians are automatically unobstructed.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>
