      <title>Turbulence and transport in mirror geometries in the Large Plasma Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to advances in plasma science and enabling technology, mirror machines are being reconsidered for fusion power plants and as possible fusion volumetric neutron sources. However cross-field transport and turbulence in mirrors remains relatively understudied compared to toroidal devices. Turbulence and transport in mirror configurations were studied utilizing the flexible magnetic geometry of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). Multiple mirror ratios from $ M = 1 $ to $ M = 2.68 $ and three mirror-cell lengths from $L = 3.51 $m to $ L = 10.86 $m were examined. Langmuir and magnetic probes were used to measure profiles of density, temperature, potential, and magnetic field. The fluctuation-driven $ \tilde{ E } \times B $ particle flux was calculated from these quantities. Two probe correlation techniques were used to infer wavenumbers and two-dimensional structure. Cross-field particle flux and density fluctuation power decreased with increased mirror ratio. Core density and temperatures remain similar with mirror ratio, but radial line-integrated density increased. The physical expansion of the plasma in the mirror cell by using a higher field in the source region may have led to reduced density fluctuation power through the increased gradient scale length. This increased scale length reduced the growth rate and saturation level of rotational interchange and drift-like instabilities. Despite the introduction of magnetic curvature, no evidence of mirror driven instabilities -- interchange, velocity space, or otherwise -- were observed. For curvature-induced interchange, many possible stabilization mechanisms were present, suppressing the visibility of the instability.</description>

      <title>Limitations from charge quantization on the parallel temperature diagnostic of nonneutral plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new algorithm to estimate the temperature of a nonneutral plasma in a Penning-Malmberg trap. The algorithm analyzes data obtained by slowly lowering a voltage that confines one end of the plasma and collecting escaping charges, and is a maximum likelihood estimator based on a physically-motivated model of the escape protocol presented in Beck [1990]. Significantly, our algorithm may be used on single-count data, allowing for improved fits with low numbers of escaping electrons. This is important for low-temperature plasmas such as those used in antihydrogen trapping. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of our algorithm, and assess its robustness to intrinsic shot noise and external noise. Approximately 100 particle counts are needed for an accuracy of +/-10% -- this provides a lower bound for measurable plasma temperatures of approximately 3 K for plasmas of length 1 cm.</description>

      <title>Oscillation damper for misaligned witness in plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a laser- or particle beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator operates in the linear or moderately nonlinear regime, injecting an externally produced particle bunch (witness) to be accelerated may encounter an alignment problem. Witness alignment tolerances can be relaxed by using a damper, an additional particle bunch produced by the same injector and propagating at a submillimeter distance ahead of the witness. If misaligned, the damper perturbs the wakefield in such a way that the witness shifts on-axis with no quality loss.</description>

      <title>Self-similar solutions of oscillatory reconnection: parameter study of magnetic field strength and background temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory reconnection is a specific type of time-dependent reconnection which involves periodic changes in the magnetic topology of a null point. The mechanism has been reported for a variety of magnetic field strengths and configurations, background temperatures and densities. All these studies report an oscillation in the current density at the null point, but also report a variety of periods, amplitudes and overall behaviors. We conduct a parametric study for equilibrium magnetic field strength and initial background temperature, solving 2D resistive MHD equations around a magnetic X-point. We introduce a parameter space for the ratio of internal-to-magnetic energy and find self-similar solutions for simulations where this ratio is below 0.1 (which represents a magnetically-dominated environment or, equivalently, a low-beta plasma). Self-similarity can be seen in oscillations in the current density at the null (including amplitude and period), Ohmic heating and the temperature generated via reconnection jets. The parameter space of energy ratios also allows us to contextualize previous studies of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism and bring those different studies together into a single unified understanding.</description>

      <title>Interparticle-Fields Amplified Radiation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trajectories of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. Yet, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, in particular during coherent emission. We present a simple generalization of the LL equation for many bodies, which includes coherence effects in the self-force. This theory is shown both analytically and numerically to satisfy energy-momentum conservation as expected. By simulating a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, we show that the inclusion of interparticle fields can significantly affect the particle dynamics and the emission spectrum, even though the external field dominates over the interparticle fields.</description>

      <title>Electron surface scattering kernel for a plasma facing a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the invariant embedding principle for the electron backscattering function, we present a scheme for constructing an electron surface scattering kernel to be used in the boundary condition for the electron Boltzmann equation of a plasma facing a semiconducting solid. The scheme takes the solid's microphysics responsible for electron emission and backscattering from the interface within a randium-jellium model into account and is applicable to dielectrics and metals as well. As an illustration, we consider silicon and germanium, describing the interface potential by a Schottky barrier and including impact ionization across the energy gap as well as scattering on phonons and ion cores. The emission yields deduced from the kernel agree well enough with measured data to support its use in the electron boundary condition of a plasma facing silicon or germanium.</description>

      <title>Compact Efficient Polarizers for Relativistic Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic spin-polarized electron beams are important for fundamental research and the industry, but their generation currently requires conventional accelerators or ultrastrong laser facilities, limiting their accessibility and broad applications. Here, we put forward a novel method for constructing a compact efficient "polarizer" that achieves direct ultrafast conversion of relativistic dense electron beams into polarized ones, based on the beam "self-polarization" mechanism via simple beam-target interactions. In this scheme, as the electron beam grazes through the polarizer (a double-layer solid target), it ionizes the target and excites an asymmetric plasma field due to the plasma backflows. This field then reacts on the beam itself, triggering spontaneous radiative polarization and reflection of the beam, and ultimately yielding a dense polarized electron beam. Moreover, the double-layer target setup induces a plasma bubble that focuses the polarized beam and reshapes its polarization distribution. Our method is robust with respect to the beam and target parameters, and opens a new avenue for relativistic beam polarization with compact accessible devices, which would facilitate their broad applications and the development of related experiments, such as in strong-field QED studies, and polarized electron-positron and electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants from photon-photon scattering in three-beam collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>
