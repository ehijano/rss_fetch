      <title>Gradient estimate for Fisher-KPP equation on Finsler metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the positive solutions of the Finslerian Fisher-KPP equation
  $$
  u_t=\Delta^{\nabla u} u+cu(1-u).
  $$
  The Fisher-KPP equation is widely applied and connected to many mathematical branches. We establish the global gradient estimates on compact Finsler metric measure manifold with the traditional $CD(K,N)$ condition, which is developed by S. Ohta and K.-T. Sturm in Finsler geometry. Furthermore, With the assistance of a new comparison theorem developed by the first author, we also give the gradient estimate on forward complete noncompact locally finite misalignment Finsler metric measure spaces with the mixed weighted curvature bounded below and some non-Riemannian curvatures norm-bounded.</description>

      <title>The heterotic G$_2$ system with reducible characteristic holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the heterotic G$_2$ system on almost contact metric manifolds with reduced characteristic holonomy. We focus on $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds and $(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, the latter being a convenient reformulation of spin $\eta$-Einstein $\alpha$-Sasaki manifolds. Investigating a $1$-parameter family of G$_2$-connections on the tangent bundle, we obtain several approximate solutions as well as one new class of exact solutions on degenerate $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds.</description>

      <title>New Rigidity Results for Critical Metrics of Some Quadratic Curvature Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new rigidity result for metrics defined on closed smooth $ n $-manifolds that are critical for the quadratic functional $ \mathfrak{F}_{t} $, which depends on the Ricci curvature $ Ric $ and the scalar curvature $ R $, and that satisfy a pinching condition of the form $ Sec &gt; \epsilon R $, where $ \epsilon $ is a function of $ t $ and $ n $, while $ Sec $ denotes the sectional curvature. In particular, we show that Bach-flat metrics with constant scalar curvature satisfying $ Sec &gt; \frac{1}{48} R $ are Einstein and, by a known result, are isometric to $ \mathbb{S}^{4} $, $ \mathbb{RP}^{4} $ or $ \mathbb{CP}^{2} $.</description>

      <title>The total absolute curvature of closed curves with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a generalization of Fenchel's theorem for closed curves as frontals in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that, for a non-co-orientable closed frontal in $\mathbb{R}^n$, its total absolute curvature is greater than or equal to $\pi$. It is equal to $\pi$ if and only if the curve is a planar locally $L$-convex closed frontal whose rotation index is $1/2$ or $-1/2$. Furthermore, if the equality holds and if every singular point is a cusp, then the number $N$ of cusps is an odd integer greater than or equal to $3$, and $N=3$ holds if and only if the curve is simple.</description>

      <title>Special Joyce structures and hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>

      <title>The Ricci-flatness that lurks in weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two constructions to obtain left-invariant Ricci-flat pseudo-Riemannian metrics on nilpotent Lie groups, one based on gradings, the other on filtrations, both depending on the combinatorics of the set of weights.
  As an application, we show that every nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension up to $7$ and every nice nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension up to $9$ admit an indefinite Ricci-flat metric.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Lott conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows with non-negative Ricci curvature where the curvature is pointwise controlled by the scalar curvature and bounded by $C/t$, starting at metric cones which are Reifenberg outside the tip. We show that any such flow behaves like a self-similar solution up to an exponential error in time. As an application, we show that smooth $n$-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly PIC1-pinched, with positive asymptotic volume ratio, are Euclidean. This confirms a higher dimensional version of a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott under the assumption of non-collapsing. It also yields a new and more direct proof of the original conjecture of Hamilton and Lott in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Locally Conformal Spin(7) Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reveals a significant connection in geometry: when the Lee form $\theta$ is normal to an almost Hermitian manifold $N$, it implies that $N$ possesses a nearly K\"ahler structure. Investigating locally conformally Spin(7) manifolds with 2-vector fields, our study provides a concise yet rigorous proof of this relationship.</description>

      <title>New invariants of involutions from Seiberg-Witten Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer theory of rational homology $3$-spheres in the special case where the group action is given by an involution. The case of involutions deserves special attention because we can couple the involution to the charge conjugation symmetry of Seiberg-Witten theory. This leads to new Floer-theoretic invariants which we study and apply in a variety of applications. In particular, we construct a series of delta-invariants $\delta^E_*, \delta^R_*, \delta^S_*$ which are the equivariant equivalents of the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o $d$-invariant. The delta-invariants come in three types: equivariant, Real and spin depending on the type of the spin$^c$-structure involved. The delta-invariants satisfy many useful properties, including a Froyshov-type inequality for equivariant cobordisms. We compute the delta-invariants in a wide range of examples including: equivariant plumbings, branched double covers of knots and equivariant Dehn surgery. We also consider various applications including obstructions to extending involutions over bounding $4$-manifolds, non-smoothable involutions on $4$-manifolds with boundary, equivariant embeddings of $3$-manifolds in $4$-manifolds and non-orientable surfaces bounding knots.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Higgs bundles and the Toledo invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex semisimple Lie group and $\mathfrak g$ its Lie algebra. In this paper, we study a special class of cyclic Higgs bundles constructed from a $\mathbb Z$-grading $\mathfrak g = \bigoplus_{j=1-m}^{m-1}\mathfrak g_j$ by using the natural representation $G_0 \to GL(\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$, where $G_0 \le G$ is the connected subgroup corresponding to $\mathfrak g_0$. The resulting Higgs pairs include $G^{\mathbb R}$-Higgs bundles for $G^{\mathbb R} \le G$ a real form of Hermitian type (in the case $m=2$) and fixed points of the ${\mathbb C}^*$-action on $G$-Higgs bundles (in the case where the Higgs field vanishes along $\mathfrak g_{1-m}$). In both of these situations a topological invariant with interesting properties, known as the Toledo invariant, has been defined and studied in the literature. This paper generalises its definition and properties to the case of arbitrary $(G_0,\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$-Higgs pairs, which give rise to families of cyclic Higgs bundles. The results are applied to the example with $m=3$ that arises from the theory of quaternion-K\"ahler symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Spectral Flow for Families of Dirac-type Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold, we construct equivariant spectral flow of paths of Dirac-type operators. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. In the case where $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact manifold, the summation map maps equivariant spectral flow on the universal cover to classical spectral flow on the base manifold. We obtain "index equals spectral flow" results. In the setting of a smooth path of $G$-invariant Riemannian metrics on a $G$-spin manifold, we show that the equivariant spectral flow of the corresponding path of spin Dirac operators relates delocalised $\eta$-invariants and $\rho$-invariants for different positive scalar curvature metrics to each other.</description>

      <title>Regularities for solutions to the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets in a pointed closed convex cone was proposed and a weak solution to the corresponding Monge-Amp\`ere equation is provided. In this paper, we consider the regularities of solutions to this problem. More generally, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets which amounts to solving a Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations. Our main purpose is to show the existence, regularity and uniqueness of solution to this problem in case $p\geq 1$ by studying variational properties for a family of Monge-Amp\`ere functinals. We also discuss the existence and optimal global H\"older regularity in case $p&lt;1$ and $q\geq n$.</description>

      <title>Helicoidal minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere: An approach via spherical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem about spherical helicoidal (in particular, rotational) surfaces with prescribed mean or Gaussian curvature in terms of a continuous function depending on the distance to its axis. As an application in the case of vanishing mean curvature, it is shown that the well-known conjugation between the belicoid and the catenoid in Euclidean three-space extends naturally to the 3-sphere to their spherical versions and determine in a quite explicit way their associated surfaces in the sense of Lawson. As a key tool, we use the notion of spherical angular momentum of the spherical curves that play the role of profile curves of the minimal helicoidal surfaces in the 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>A characterization of horizontally totally geodesic hypersurfaces in Heisenberg groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we achieve a first concrete step towards a better understanding of the so-called Bernstein problem in higher dimensional Heisenberg groups. Indeed, in the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$, with $n\geq 2$, we show that the only entire hypersurfaces with vanishing horizontal symmetric second fundamental form are hyperplanes. This result relies on a sub-Riemannian characterization of a higher dimensional ruling property, as well as on the study of sub-Riemannian geodesics on Heisenberg hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and Dirac operators on weighted manifolds and smooth metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a weighted positive mass theorem which unifies and generalizes results of Baldauf--Ozuch and Chu--Zhu. Our result is in fact equivalent to the usual positive mass theorem, and can be regarded as a positive mass theorem for smooth metric measure spaces. We also study Dirac operators on certain warped product manifolds associated to smooth metric measure spaces. Applications of this include, among others, an alternative proof for a special case of our positive mass theorem, eigenvalue bounds for the Dirac operator on closed spin manifolds, and a new way to understand the weighted Dirac operator using warped products.</description>
