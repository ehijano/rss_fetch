      <title>Entropy of Wiener integrals with respect to fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the properties of the entropy of the exponent-Wiener-integral fractional Gaussian process (EWIFG-process), that is a Wiener integral of the exponent with respect to fractional Brownian motion. Unlike fractional Brownian motion, whose entropy has very simple monotonicity properties in Hurst index, the behavior of the entropy of EWIFG-process is much more involved and depends on the moment of time. We consider these properties of monotonicity in great detail.</description>

      <title>Strong uniform Wong--Zakai approximations of L\'evy-driven Marcus SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a solution $X$ of a L\'evy-driven $d$-dimensional Marcus (canonical) stochastic differential equation, we show that the Wong--Zakai type approximation scheme $X^h$ has a strong convergence of order $\frac12$: for each $T\in [0,\infty)$ and all $x\in\mathbb R^d$ we have $$ \mathbf E \sup_{kh\leq T}|X_{kh}(x)-X^h_{kh}(x)|\leq C h^{\frac{1}{2}}(1+|x|),\quad h\to 0. $$ We also determine the rate of the locally uniform strong convergence: for each $N\in(0,\infty)$ and $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ we have $$ \mathbf E\sup_{|x|\leq N}\sup_{kh\leq T}|X_{kh}(x)-X^h_{kh}(x)|\leq C h^{\frac{1-\varepsilon}{4d}},\quad h\to 0. $$</description>

      <title>More on the asymptotic behaviour of moments of branching Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a branching Markov process, $X = (X(t), t \ge 0)$, with non-local branching mechanism. Studying the asymptotic behaviour of the moments of X has recently received attention in the literature [6, 7] due to the importance of these results in understanding the underlying genealogical structure of $X$. In this article, we generalise the results of [7] to allow for a non-simple leading eigenvalue and to also study the higher order fluctuations of the moments of $X$. These results will be useful for proving central limit theorems and extending well-known LLN results.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics and relaxation limit for multilane exclusion process and related hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic behavior and local equilibrium of the multilane exclusion process, whose invariant measures were studied in our previous paper \cite{mlt1a}. The dynamics on each lane follows a hyperbolic time scaling, whereas the interlane dynamics has an arbitrary time scaling. We prove the following: (i) the hydrodynamic behavior of the global density (i.e. summed over all lanes) is governed by a scalar conservation law; (ii) the latter, as well as the limit of individual lanes, is the relaxation limit of a weakly coupled hyperbolic system of balance laws that approximates the particle system. For the hydrodynamic limit, to highlight new phenomena arising in our model, a precise computation of the flux function, with the transitions between different possible shapes (and a physical interpretation thereof), is given for the two-lane model.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and absolute zeta functions of multi-state Grover walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, are extensively studied for their applications in mathematics, quantum physics, and quantum information science. This study explores the periods and absolute zeta functions of Grover walks on cycle graphs. Specifically, we investigate Grover walks with an odd number of states and determine their periods for cycles with any number of vertices greater than or equal to two. In addition, we compute the absolute zeta functions of M-type Grover walks with finite periods. These results advance the understanding of the properties of Grover walks and their connection to absolute zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Explosive appearance of cores and bootstrap percolation on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the process where the $n$ vertices of a square $2$-dimensional torus appear consecutively in a random order. We show that typically the size of the $3$-core of the corresponding induced unit-distance graph transitions from $0$ to $n-o(n)$ within a single step. Equivalently, by infecting the vertices of the torus in a random order under $2$-bootstrap percolation, the size of the infected set transitions instantaneously from $o(n)$ to $n$. This hitting time result answers a question of Benjamini.
  We also study the much more challenging and general setting of bootstrap percolation on two-dimensional lattices for a variety of finite-range infection rules. In this case, powerful but fragile bootstrap percolation tools such as the rectangles process and the Aizenman--Lebowitz lemma become unavailable. We develop a new method complementing and replacing these standard techniques, thus allowing us to prove the above hitting time result for a wide family of threshold bootstrap percolation rules on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, including neighbourhoods given by large $\ell^p$ balls for $p\in[1,\infty]$.</description>

      <title>Approximate Slow Manifolds in the Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of a fast-slow Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (PDE) viewed as the evolution equation for the density of a multiscale planar stochastic differential equation (SDE). Our key focus is on the existence of a slow manifold on the PDE level, which is a crucial tool from the geometric singular perturbation theory allowing the reduction of the system to a lower dimensional slowly evolving equation. In particular, we use a projection approach based upon a Sturm- Liouville eigenbasis to convert the Fokker-Planck PDE to an infinite system of PDEs that can be truncated/approximated to any order. Based upon this truncation, we can employ the recently developed theory for geometric singular perturbation theory for slow manifolds for infinite-dimensional evolution equations. This strategy presents a new perspective on the dynamics of multiple time-scale SDEs as it combines ideas from several previously disjoint reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Relating Misfit to Gain in Weak-to-Strong Generalization Beyond the Squared Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of weak-to-strong generalization constitutes the training of a strong AI model on data labeled by a weak AI model, with the goal that the strong model nevertheless outperforms its weak supervisor on the target task of interest. For the setting of real-valued regression with the squared loss, recent work quantitatively characterizes the gain in performance of the strong model over the weak model in terms of the misfit between the strong and weak model. We generalize such a characterization to learning tasks whose loss functions correspond to arbitrary Bregman divergences when the strong class is convex. This extends the misfit-based characterization of performance gain in weak-to-strong generalization to classification tasks, as the cross-entropy loss can be expressed in terms of a Bregman divergence. In most practical scenarios, however, the strong model class may not be convex. We therefore weaken this assumption and study weak-to-strong generalization for convex combinations of $k$ strong models in the strong class, in the concrete setting of classification. This allows us to obtain a similar misfit-based characterization of performance gain, upto an additional error term that vanishes as $k$ gets large. Our theoretical findings are supported by thorough experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Fast exact recovery of noisy matrix from few entries: the infinity norm approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix recovery (completion) problem, a central problem in data science and theoretical computer science, is to recover a matrix $A$ from a relatively small sample of entries.
  While such a task is impossible in general, it has been shown that one can recover $A$ exactly in polynomial time, with high probability, from a random subset of entries, under three (basic and necessary) assumptions: (1) the rank of $A$ is very small compared to its dimensions (low rank), (2) $A$ has delocalized singular vectors (incoherence), and (3) the sample size is sufficiently large.
  There are many different algorithms for the task, including convex optimization by Candes, Tao and Recht (2009), alternating projection by Hardt and Wooters (2014) and low rank approximation with gradient descent by Keshavan, Montanari and Oh (2009, 2010).
  In applications, it is more realistic to assume that data is noisy. In this case, these approaches provide an approximate recovery with small root mean square error. However, it is hard to transform such approximate recovery to an exact one.
  Recently, results by Abbe et al. (2017) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) concerning approximation in the infinity norm showed that we can achieve exact recovery even in the noisy case, given that the ground matrix has bounded precision. Beyond the three basic assumptions above, they required either the condition number of $A$ is small (Abbe et al.) or the gap between consecutive singular values is large (Bhardwaj et al.).
  In this paper, we remove these extra spectral assumptions. As a result, we obtain a simple algorithm for exact recovery in the noisy case, under only three basic assumptions. This is the first such algorithm. To analyse the algorithm, we introduce a contour integration argument which is totally different from all previous methods and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimal transportation and pressure at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, a Lipschitz continuous cost function $c$ on $X \times Y$ and two probabilities $\mu \in\mathcal{P}(X),\,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(Y)$, we propose to study the Monge-Kantorovich problem and its duality from a zero temperature limit of a convex pressure function. We consider the entropy defined by $H(\pi) = -D_{KL}(\pi|\mu\times \nu)$, where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and then the pressure defined by the variational principle \[P(\beta A) = \sup_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \left[ \smallint \beta A\,d\pi + H(\pi)\right],\]where $\beta&gt;0$ and $A=-c$. We will show that it admits a dual formulation and when $\beta \to+\infty$ we recover the solution for the usual Monge-Kantorovich problem and its Kantorovich duality. Such approach is similar to one which is well known in Thermodynamic Formalism and Ergodic Optimization, where $\beta$ is interpreted as the inverse of the temperature ($\beta = \frac{1}{T}$) and $\beta\to+\infty$ is interpreted as a zero temperature limit.</description>

      <title>The phase transition in bounded-size Achlioptas processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1704.08714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perhaps the best understood phase transition is that in the component structure of the uniform random graph process introduced by Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi around 1960. Since the model is so fundamental, it is very interesting to know which features of this phase transition are specific to the model, and which are `universal', at least within some larger class of processes (a `universality class'). Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number of conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas processes share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi phase transition. We do not expect this to hold for Achlioptas processes in general.</description>

Abstract: We study a natural random walk on the $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices, with entries in $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$, generated by steps which add or subtract a uniformly random row to the row above. We show that the mixing time of this random walk is $O(m^2n \log n+ n^2 m^{o(1)})$. This answers a question of Stong and of Arias-Castro, Diaconis, and Stanley.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness, exponential ergodicity and numerical approximation of fully super-linear McKean--Vlasov SDEs and associated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to investigate the existence of ergodic invariant measures and its uniqueness, associated with obstacle problems governed by a T-monotone operator defined on Sobolev spaces and driven by a multiplicative noise in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with homogeneous boundary conditions. We show that the solution defines a Markov-Feller semigroup defined on the space of real bounded continuous functions of a convex subset related to the obstacle and we prove the existence of ergodic invariant measures and its uniqueness, under suitable assumptions. Our method relies on a combination of "Krylov Bogoliubov theorem", "Krein Milman theorem" and Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to control the reflection measure.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the jump of the cover time in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $\mathrm{Poi}(n)$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $(1+\varepsilon)r_g \le r \le (1-\varepsilon)r_c$ for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ arbitrarily small, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\varepsilon)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor). Our proofs also shed some light onto the behavior around $r_c$.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two variants of the induced subgraph isomorphism problem for two independent binomial random graphs with constant edge-probabilities p_1,p_2. In particular, (i) we prove a sharp threshold result for the appearance of G_{n,p_1} as an induced subgraph of G_{N,p_2}, (ii) we show two-point concentration of the size of the maximum common induced subgraph of G_{N, p_1} and G_{N,p_2}, and (iii) we show that the number of induced copies of G_{n,p_1} in G_{N,p_2} has an unusual limiting distribution.
  These results confirm simulation-based predictions of McCreesh, Prosser, Solnon and Trimble, and resolve several open problems of Chatterjee and Diaconis. The proofs are based on careful refinements of the first and second moment method, using extra twists to (a) take some non-standard behaviors into account, and (b) work around the large variance issues that prevent standard applications of these methods.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Otal and Rosas [41], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [30].</description>

      <title>Poissonian pair correlations for dependent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) for uniformly distributed sequences of random numbers with a dependency structure. More specifically, we treat two classes of dependent random variables which have widely been studied in the literature, namely sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus. We show that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that, under some mild assumptions, the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</description>

      <title>Solutions of stationary McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. On a sphere, we employ the properties of spherical convolution to study the bifurcation branches around the uniform state. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel and compare it to the Euclidean setting. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>
