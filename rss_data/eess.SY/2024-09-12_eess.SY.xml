      <title>Equilibria and Their Stability Do Not Depend on the Control Barrier Function in Safe Optimization-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) play a critical role in the design of safe optimization-based controllers for control-affine systems. Given a CBF associated with a desired ``safe'' set, the typical approach consists in embedding CBF-based constraints into the optimization problem defining the control law to enforce forward invariance of the safe set. While this approach effectively guarantees safety for a given CBF, the CBF-based control law can introduce undesirable equilibrium points (i.e., points that are not equilibria of the original system); open questions remain on how the choice of CBF influences the number and locations of undesirable equilibria and, in general, the dynamics of the closed-loop system. This paper investigates how the choice of CBF impacts the dynamics of the closed-loop system and shows that: (i) The CBF does not affect the number, location, and (local) stability properties of the equilibria in the interior of the safe set; (ii) undesirable equilibria only appear on the boundary of the safe set; and, (iii) the number and location of undesirable equilibria for the closed-loop system do not depend of the choice of the CBF. Additionally, for the well-established safety filters and controllers based on both CBF and control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), we show that the stability properties of equilibria of the closed-loop system are independent of the choice of the CBF and of the associated extended class-K function.</description>

      <title>A Hardened CO$_2$ Sensor for In-Ground Continuous Measurement in a Perennial Grass System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide levels below the soil surface are an important measurement relating to plant health, especially for plants such as perennial grasses in northern climates where ice encasement can occur over winter. In such cases, the CO$_2$ levels can build up and become toxic. This is likely a significant contributor to turfgrass death over winter; however, there is an insufficient amount of data regarding this phenomenon in large part due to the lack of effective sensors. Many off the shelf CO$_2$ sensors exist, but they are not sufficiently hardened for in ground deployment over winter. As a result, the only options currently available are very costly automated gas samplers or manual sampling at intervals with laboratory testing -- a process that results in a limited number of data points and is labor intensive. To combat this problem we have taken an established NDIR CO$_2$ sensor and hardened it for use in winter and ice encased environments to allow for continuous automated sampling of subsurface CO$_2$ levels to better understand ice encasement damage in perennial grass systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically safe controllers based on control barrier functions and scenario model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer an efficient framework for designing real-time safe controllers. However, CBF-based controllers can be short-sighted, resulting in poor performance, a behavior which is aggravated in uncertain conditions. This motivated research on safety filters based on model predictive control (MPC) and its stochastic variations. MPC deals with safety constraints in a direct manner, however, its computational demands grow with the prediction horizon length. We propose a safety formulation that solves a finite horizon optimization problem at each time instance like MPC, but rather than explicitly imposing constraints along the prediction horizon, we enforce probabilistic safety constraints by means of CBFs only at the first step of the horizon. The probabilistic CBF constraints is transformed in a finite number of deterministic CBF constraints via the scenario based methodology. Capitalizing on results on scenario based MPC, we provide distribution-free, \emph{a priori} guarantees on the system's closed loop expected safety violation frequency. We demonstrate our results through a case study on unmanned aerial vehicle collision free position swapping, and provide a numerical comparison with recent stochastic CBF formulations.</description>

      <title>Safe and Stable Connected Cruise Control for Connected Automated Vehicles with Response Lag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling connected automated vehicles (CAVs) via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity holds significant promise for improving fuel economy and traffic efficiency. However, to deploy CAVs and reap their benefits, their controllers must guarantee their safety. In this paper, we apply control barrier function (CBF) theory to investigate the safety of CAVs implementing connected cruise control (CCC). Specifically, we study how stability, connection architecture, and the CAV's response time impact the safety of CCC. Through safety and stability analyses, we derive stable and safe choices of control gains, and show that safe CAV operation requires plant and head-to-tail string stability in most cases. Furthermore, the reaction time of vehicles, which is represented as a first-order lag, has a detrimental effect on safety. We determine the critical value of this lag, above which safe CCC gains do not exist. To guarantee safety even with lag while preserving the benefits of CCC, we synthesize safety-critical CCC using CBFs. With the proposed safety-critical CCC, the CAV can leverage information from connected vehicles farther ahead to improve its safety. We evaluate this controller by numerical simulation using real traffic data.</description>

      <title>Bio-Eng-LMM AI Assist chatbot: A Comprehensive Tool for Research and Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces Bio-Eng-LMM AI chatbot, a versatile platform designed to enhance user interaction for educational and research purposes. Leveraging cutting-edge open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), Bio-Eng-LMM operates as a sophisticated AI assistant, exploiting the capabilities of traditional models like ChatGPT. Central to Bio-Eng-LMM is its implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through three primary methods: integration of preprocessed documents, real-time processing of user-uploaded files, and information retrieval from any specified website. Additionally, the chatbot incorporates image generation via a Stable Diffusion Model (SDM), image understanding and response generation through LLAVA, and search functionality on the internet powered by secure search engine such as DuckDuckGo. To provide comprehensive support, Bio-Eng-LMM offers text summarization, website content summarization, and both text and voice interaction. The chatbot maintains session memory to ensure contextually relevant and coherent responses. This integrated platform builds upon the strengths of RAG-GPT and Web-Based RAG Query (WBRQ) where the system fetches relevant information directly from the web to enhance the LLMs response generation.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Mode Decomposition for Finite Discrete Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an orthogonal mode decomposition method is proposed to decompose ffnite length real signals on both the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane. The interpolation function space of ffnite length discrete signal is constructed, and the relationship between the dimensionality of the interpolation function space and its subspaces and the band width of the interpolation function is analyzed. It is proved that the intrinsic mode is actually the narrow band signal whose intrinsic instantaneous frequency is always positive (or always negative). Thus, the eigenmode decomposition problem is transformed into the orthogonal projection problem of interpolation function space to its low frequency subspace or narrow band subspace. Different from the existing mode decomposition methods, the orthogonal modal decomposition is a local time-frequency domain algorithm. Each operation extracts a speciffc mode. The global decomposition results obtained under the precise deffnition of eigenmodes have uniqueness and orthogonality. The computational complexity of the orthogonal mode decomposition method is also much smaller than that of the existing mode decomposition methods.</description>

      <title>Low carbon optimal scheduling of integrated energy system considering waste heat utilization under the coordinated operation of incineration power plant and P2G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to improve energy utilization and reduce carbon emissions, this paper presents a comprehensive energy system economic operation strategy of Incineration power plant Power-to-gas (P2G) with waste heat recovery. First, consider the coordinated operation of Incineration power plant - P2G, introduce the refined Power-to-gas two-stage operation process, add Hydrogen fuel cells on the basis of traditional Power-to-gas to reduce the energy ladder loss, and recycle the Methanation reaction heat; Secondly, in order to improve the energy utilization efficiency of Incineration, it is considered to install a waste heat recovery device containing a water source heat pump to recover the waste heat of flue gas and consume some electric energy, sourced from wind power, and add a CO2 separation device to combine the recovered CO2 with P2G to synthesize CH4 to achieve carbon recycling. Finally, within the framework of a tiered carbon trading mechanism an IES optimization model for electricity-heat with the goal of minimizing the system operating cost is constructed, and the GUROBI modeling optimization engine is used to solve this model. The results verify the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter for Tightly Coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pose estimation is a crucial problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.</description>

      <title>Control Pneumatic Soft Bending Actuator with Feedforward Hysteresis Compensation by Pneumatic Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinearities of soft robots bring control challenges like hysteresis but also provide them with computational capacities. This paper introduces a fuzzy pneumatic physical reservoir computing (FPRC) model for feedforward hysteresis compensation in motion tracking control of soft actuators. Our method utilizes a pneumatic bending actuator as a physical reservoir with nonlinear computing capacities to control another pneumatic bending actuator. The FPRC model employs a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to process outputs from the physical reservoir. In comparative evaluations, the FPRC model shows equivalent training performance to an Echo State Network (ESN) model, whereas it exhibits better test accuracies with significantly reduced execution time. Experiments validate the proposed FPRC model's effectiveness in controlling the bending motion of the pneumatic soft actuator with open and closed-loop control systems. The proposed FPRC model's robustness against environmental disturbances has also been experimentally verified. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first implementation of a physical system in the feedforward hysteresis compensation model for controlling soft actuators. This study is expected to advance physical reservoir computing in nonlinear control applications and extend the feedforward hysteresis compensation methods for controlling soft actuators.</description>

      <title>An Improved Height Difference Based Model of Height Profile for Drop-on-Demand 3D Printing With UV Curable Ink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved height profile model for drop-on-demand 3D printing with UV curable ink. It is extended from a previously validated model and computes height profile indirectly from volume and area propagation to ensure volume conservation. To accommodate 2D patterns using multiple passes, volume change and area change within region of interest are modeled as a piecewise function of height difference before drop deposition. Model coefficients are experimentally obtained and validated with bootstrapping of experimental samples. Six different drop patterns are experimentally validated. The RMS height profile errors for 2D patterns from the proposed model are consistently smaller than existing models from literature and are on the same level as 1D patterns reported in our previous publication.</description>

      <title>A feedback control approach to convex optimization with inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-time algorithm for inequality-constrained convex optimization inspired by proportional-integral control. Unlike the popular primal-dual gradient dynamics, our method includes a proportional term to control the primal variable through the Lagrange multipliers. This approach has both theoretical and practical advantages. On the one hand, it simplifies the proof of the exponential convergence in the case of smooth, strongly convex problems, with a more straightforward assessment of the convergence rate concerning prior literature. On the other hand, through several examples, we show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than primal-dual gradient dynamics. This paper aims to illustrate these points by thoroughly analyzing the algorithm convergence and discussing some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of nonlinear ODE Models with Time-Varying Parameters: the General Analytical Solution and Applications in Viral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13507v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifiability is a structural property of any ODE model characterized by a set of unknown parameters. It describes the possibility of determining the values of these parameters from fusing the observations of the system inputs and outputs. This paper finds the general analytical solution of this fundamental problem and, based on this, provides a general and automated analytical method to determine the identifiability of the unknown parameters. In particular, the method can handle any model, regardless of its complexity and type of non-linearity, and provides the identifiability of the parameters even when they are time-varying. In addition, it is automatic as it simply needs to follow the steps of a systematic procedure that only requires to perform the calculation of derivatives and matrix ranks. Time-varying parameters are treated as unknown inputs and their identification is based on the very recent analytical solution of the unknown input observability problem [1, 2]. The method is used to determine the identifiability of the unknown time-varying parameters that characterize two non-linear models in the field of viral dynamics (HIV and Covid-19) and a non-linear model that characterizes the genetic toggle switch. New fundamental properties that characterize these models are determined and discussed in detail through a comparison with the state-of-the-art results. In particular, regarding the very popular HIV ODE model and the genetic toggle switch model, the method automatically finds new important results that are in contrast with the results in the current literature.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Privacy-Preserving $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-Optimal Interval Observer Design for Bounded-Error LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper furthers current research into the notion of guaranteed privacy, which provides a deterministic characterization of the privacy of output signals of a dynamical system or mechanism. Unlike stochastic differential privacy, guaranteed privacy offers strict bounds on the proximity between the ranges of two sets of estimated data. Our approach relies on synthesizing an interval observer for a perturbed linear time-invariant (LTI) bounded-error system. The design procedure incorporates a bounded noise perturbation factor computation and observer gains synthesis. Consequently, the observer simultaneously provides guaranteed private and stable interval-valued estimates for a desired variable. We demonstrate the optimality of our design by minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm of the observer error system. Furthermore, we assess the accuracy of our proposed mechanism by quantifying the loss incurred when considering guaranteed privacy specifications. Finally, we illustrate the outperformance of the proposed approach to differential privacy through simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty propagation in non-linear dynamical systems has become a key problem in various fields including control theory and machine learning. In this work we focus on discrete-time non-linear stochastic dynamical systems. We present a novel approach to approximate the distribution of the system over a given finite time horizon with a mixture of distributions. The key novelty of our approach is that it not only provides tractable approximations for the distribution of a non-linear stochastic system, but also comes with formal guarantees of correctness. In particular, we consider the total variation (TV) distance to quantify the distance between two distributions and derive an upper bound on the TV between the distribution of the original system and the approximating mixture distribution derived with our framework. We show that in various cases of interest, including in the case of Gaussian noise, the resulting bound can be efficiently computed in closed form. This allows us to quantify the correctness of the approximation and to optimize the parameters of the resulting mixture distribution to minimize such distance. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on several benchmarks from the control community.</description>

      <title>State-Augmented Linear Games with Antagonistic Error for High-Dimensional, Nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is a popular method for analyzing the liveness and safety of a dynamical system with bounded control and disturbance. The corresponding HJ value function offers a robust controller and characterizes the reachable sets, but is traditionally solved with Dynamic Programming (DP) and limited to systems of dimension less than six. Recently, the space-parallelizeable, generalized Hopf formula has been shown to also solve the HJ value with a nearly three-log increase in dimension limit, but is limited to linear systems. To extend this potential, we demonstrate how state-augmented (SA) spaces, which are well-known for their improved linearization accuracy, may be used to solve tighter, conservative approximations of the value function with any linear model in this SA space. Namely, we show that with a representation of the true dynamics in the SA space, a series of inequalities confirms that the value of a SA linear game with antagonistic error is a conservative envelope of the true value function. It follows that if the optimal controller for the HJ SA linear game with error may succeed, it will also succeed in the true system. Unlike previous methods, this result offers the ability to safely approximate reachable sets and their corresponding controllers with the Hopf formula in a non-convex manner. Finally, we demonstrate this in the slow manifold system for clarity, and in the controlled Van der Pol system with different lifting functions.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Efficient Approximation of Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) bypasses the need for system identification by directly leveraging raw data to formulate optimal control policies. However, the size of the optimization problem in DeePC grows linearly with respect to the data size, which prohibits its application to resource-constrained systems due to high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation of DeePC, whose size is invariant with respect to the amount of data collected, via differentiable convex programming. Specifically, the optimization problem in DeePC is decomposed into two parts: a control objective and a scoring function that evaluates the likelihood of a guessed I/O sequence, the latter of which is approximated with a size-invariant learned optimization problem. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a quadruple tank system, illustrating that the learned controller can reduce the computational time of DeePC by a factor of 5 while maintaining its control performance.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated vehicle platooning, where the platoon followers communicate solely with the platoon leader. A dynamic model is proposed to account for driving safety under communication delays. General linear stability results are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the impact of model parameters in two scenarios: a ring road with initial disturbance and an infinite road with periodic disturbance. The simulation outcomes align with the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed "look-to-the-leader" platooning strategy significantly outperforms conventional car-following strategies, such as following one or two vehicles ahead, in terms of traffic flow stabilization. This paper introduces a new perspective on organizing platoons for autonomous vehicles, with implications for enhancing traffic stability.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <title>Emerging clean technologies: policy-driven cost reductions, implications and perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen production from water electrolysis, direct air capture (DAC), and synthetic kerosene derived from hydrogen and CO2 (`e-kerosene') are expected to play an important role in global decarbonization efforts. So far, the economics of these nascent technologies hamper their market diffusion. However, a wave of recent policy support in the United States, Europe, China, and elsewhere is anticipated to drive their commercial liftoff and bring their costs down. To this end, we evaluate the potential cost reductions driven by policy-induced scale-up of these emerging technologies through 2030 using an experience curves approach accounting for both local and global learning effects. We then analyze the consequences of projected cost declines on the competitiveness of these nascent technologies compared to conventional fossil alternatives, where applicable, and highlight some of the tradeoffs associated with their expansion. Our findings indicate that enacted policies could lead to substantial capital cost reductions for electrolyzers. Nevertheless, electrolytic hydrogen production at $1-2/kg would still require some form of policy support. Given expected costs and experience curves, it is unlikely that liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) scale-up will bring removal costs to stated targets of $100/tCO2, though a $200/tCO2 may eventually be within reach. We also underscore the importance of tackling methane leakage for natural gas-powered L-DAC: unmitigated leaks amplify net removal costs, exacerbate the investment requirements to reach targeted costs, and cast doubt on L-DAC's role in the clean energy transition. Lastly, despite reductions in electrolysis and L-DAC costs, e-kerosene remains considerably more expensive than fossil jet fuel. The economics of e-kerosene and the resources required for production raise questions about the fuel's ultimate viability as a decarbonization tool for aviation.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems Under Acyclic Spatio-Temporal Task Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel distributed sampled-data control method tailored for heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a global spatio-temporal task with acyclic dependencies. Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control with Optimized Feedback Gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of direct data-driven predictive control for unknown stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with partial state observation. Building upon our previous research on data-driven stochastic control, this paper (i) relaxes the assumption of Gaussian process and measurement noise, and (ii) enables optimization of the gain matrix within the affine feedback policy. Output safety constraints are modelled using conditional value-at-risk, and enforced in a distributionally robust sense. Under idealized assumptions, we prove that our proposed data-driven control method yields control inputs identical to those produced by an equivalent model-based stochastic predictive controller. A simulation study illustrates the enhanced performance of our approach over previous designs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Electro-Optic Analog Memory for Neuromorphic Photonic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and ADCs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and compares various analog memory technologies for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Auto-Multilift: Distributed Learning and Control for Cooperative Load Transportation With Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing motion control and planning algorithms for multilift systems remains challenging due to the complexities of dynamics, collision avoidance, actuator limits, and scalability. Existing methods that use optimization and distributed techniques effectively address these constraints and scalability issues. However, they often require substantial manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes Auto-Multilift, a novel framework that automates the tuning of model predictive controllers (MPCs) for multilift systems. We model the MPC cost functions with deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling fast online adaptation to various scenarios. We develop a distributed policy gradient algorithm to train these DNNs efficiently in a closed-loop manner. Central to our algorithm is distributed sensitivity propagation, which is built on fully exploiting the unique dynamic couplings within the multilift system. It parallelizes gradient computation across quadrotors and focuses on actual system state sensitivities relative to key MPC parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate favorable scalability to a large number of quadrotors. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art open-loop MPC tuning approach by effectively learning adaptive MPCs from trajectory tracking errors. It also excels in learning an adaptive reference for reconfiguring the system when traversing multiple narrow slots.</description>

Abstract: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, we introduce a new Carbon-Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS) Algorithm that addresses the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) while minimizing carbon emissions. This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony pheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and economic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models, CAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network design, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our algorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable transportation solutions.</description>
