      <title>Generation of relativistic polarized electron beams via collective beam-target interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic polarized electron beams can find applications in broad areas of fundamental physics. Here, we propose for the first time that electron spin polarization can be realized efficiently via collective beam-target interactions. When a relativistic unpolarized electron beam is incident onto the surface of a solid target with a grazing angle, strong magnetic fields are induced at the target surface due to the formation of a high reflux of target electrons. This results in violent beam self-focusing and corresponding beam density increase via magnetic pinching. The pinched dense beam in turn further enhances the magnetic fields to the level of a few Giga-Gauss, which is high enough to trigger strong synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons. During the interaction, electron spin polarization develops along the magnetic field direction, which is achieved via radiative spin flips in the quantum radiation-dominated regime. As a consequence, the incident electron beam can be effectively polarized via the spin-dependent radiation reaction, for example, the mean polarization of electrons with energy less than 2 GeV can reach above 50% for an initial 5GeV beam. This provides a robust way for the development of polarized electron sources.</description>

      <title>Attosecond gamma-ray flashes and electron-positron pairs in dyadic laser interaction with micro-wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of an ultra-intense laser with matter is an efficient source of high-energy particles, with efforts directed towards narrowing the divergence and simultaneously increasing the brightness. In this paper we report on emission of highly collimated, ultrabright, attosecond $\gamma$-photons and generation of dense electron-positron pairs via a tunable particle generation scheme which utilizes the interaction of two high-power lasers with a thin wire target. Irradiating the target with a radially polarized laser pulse first produces a series of high charge, short duration, electron bunches with low transverse momentum. These electron bunches subsequently collide with a counter-propagating high intensity laser. Depending on the intensity of the counter-propagating laser, the scheme generates highly collimated ultra-bright GeV-level $\gamma$-beams and/or electron-positron plasma of solid density level.</description>
