      <title>An Integrated Lab on a CD Microfluidic Platform for High-Efficiency Blood Cell Separation and Passive Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood accounts for 7-8% of total body weight, with an average adult containing 4.5 to 6 quarts. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells, removes waste products, supports immunity, and regulates body temperature. Comprising over 4,000 components, including plasma, platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes, blood presents a challenge for isolating specific cell types due to its heterogeneity. In autologous therapies, target cells may be as rare as one per million background cells. This study presents the development of a compact disc (CD)-based microfluidic device for high-throughput, label-free separation of blood components. The system integrates three main modules on a single disk: cell sorting, fluid control, and cell lysis. The initial module utilizes Pinched Flow Fractionation (PFF) to separate red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets based on size, achieving 99.99% efficiency. A capillary valve directs the sorted cells to the lysis module, where a chemical reagent is used to rupture cell membranes for downstream analysis. To enhance lysis efficiency, a micro mixer was incorporated using two zigzag geometries with internal barriers. The mixing performance of both designs was evaluated to determine optimal fluid interaction. This integrated, multifunctional CD platform offers a compact and effective solution for isolating and processing specific blood cells, with potential applications in diagnostics and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.</description>

      <title>A dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation framework for cardiorespiratory motion-resolved real-time volumetric MR imaging (DREME-MR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a 3D pre-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) scan, we developed DREME-MR to jointly reconstruct the reference patient anatomy and a data-driven, patient-specific cardiorespiratory motion model. Via a motion encoder simultaneously learned during the reconstruction, DREME-MR further enables real-time volumetric MR imaging and cardiorespiratory motion tracking with minimal intra treatment k-space data. From a 3D radial-spoke-based pre-treatment MR scan, DREME-MR uses spatiotemporal implicit-neural-representation (INR) to reconstruct pre-treatment dynamic volumetric MR images (learning task 1). The INR-based reconstruction takes a joint image reconstruction and deformable registration approach, yielding a reference anatomy and a corresponding cardiorespiratory motion model. The motion model adopts a low-rank, multi-resolution representation to decompose motion fields as products of motion coefficients and motion basis components (MBCs). Via a progressive, frequency-guided strategy, DREME-MR decouples cardiac MBCs from respiratory MBCs to resolve the two distinct motion modes. Simultaneously with the pre-treatment dynamic MRI reconstruction, DREME-MR also trains an INR-based motion encoder to infer cardiorespiratory motion coefficients directly from the raw k-space data (learning task 2), allowing real-time, intra-treatment volumetric MR imaging and motion tracking with minimal k-space data (20-30 spokes) acquired after the pre-treatment MRI scan. Evaluated using data from a digital phantom (XCAT) and a human scan, DREME-MR solves real-time 3D cardiorespiratory motion with a latency of &lt; 165 ms (= 150-ms data acquisition + 15-ms inference time), fulfilling the temporal constraint of real-time imaging.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Proton Treatment Planning: a novel approach for optimizing underdosage and overdosage probabilities of target and organ structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment planning uncertainties are typically managed using margin-based or robust optimization. Margin-based methods expand the clinical target volume (CTV) to a planning target volume, generally unsuited for proton therapy. Robust optimization considers worst-case scenarios, but its quality depends on the uncertainty scenario set: excluding extremes reduces robustness, while too many make plans overly conservative. Probabilistic optimization overcomes these limits by modeling a continuous scenario distribution. We propose a novel probabilistic optimization approach that steers plans toward individualized probability levels to control CTV and organs-at-risk (OARs) under- and overdosage. Voxel-wise dose percentiles ($d$) are estimated by expected value ($E$) and standard deviation (SD) as $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$, where $\delta$ is iteratively tuned to match the target percentile given Gaussian-distributed setup (3 mm) and range (3%) uncertainties. The method involves an inner optimization of $E[d] \pm \delta \cdot SD[d]$ for fixed $\delta$, and an outer loop updating $\delta$. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) provides accurate and efficient dose estimates during optimization. We validated the method on a spherical CTV abutted by an OAR in different directions and a horseshoe-shaped CTV surrounding a cylindrical spine. For spherical cases with similar CTV coverage, $P(D_{2\%} &gt; 30 Gy)$ dropped by 10-15%; for matched OAR dose, $P(D_{98\%} &gt; 57 Gy)$ increased by 67.5-71%. In spinal plans, $P(D_{98\%} &gt; 57 Gy)$ increased by 10-15% while $P(D_{2\%} &gt; 30 Gy)$ dropped 24-28%. Probabilistic and robust optimization times were comparable for spherical (hours) but longer for spinal cases (7.5 - 11.5 h vs. 9 - 20 min). Compared to discrete scenario-based optimization, the probabilistic method offered better OAR sparing or target coverage depending on the set priorities.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a $\Delta$E-E telescope based on CeBr$_3$ scintillator for secondary charged particles measurements in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadrontherapy is an established cancer treatment method that enables a more localized dose deposition compared to conventional radiotherapy, potentially reducing the dose to surrounding healthy tissues in certain clinical cases. However, a key limitation in current treatment planning lies in the limited experimental data available for the characterization of secondary particles generated by nuclear interactions of the primary beam with tissues, which directly impacts the accuracy of Monte Carlo tools and analytical models used in dose calculations. Indeed, this leads to the adoption of larger safety margins and can limit the use of hadrontherapy for treating certain complex or sensitive tumor locations.
  This work is part of the context of the characterization of secondary charged particles generated by ion beams in the energy range relevant for particle therapy applications, using a $\Delta E-E$ telescope comprising a CeBr$_3$ crystal scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The calibration and response of this telescope to ions commonly used in clinical settings is presented in this work, highlighting adherence to Birks' law for accurate energy measurements.
  This study is the first to optimize a $\Delta E-E$ telescope combining CeBr$_3$ and plastic scintillators specifically for secondary particle detection in hadrontherapy. It represents an essential step toward the experimental acquisition of nuclear data, enabling accurate measurement and identification of secondary charged particles generated by therapeutic beams in tissue-equivalent materials. The system is designed for use in controlled experimental setups that reproduce clinical conditions, with the goal of improving the predictive accuracy of treatment planning software through enhanced Monte Carlo simulation inputs.</description>
