      <title>A case study of the long-time behavior of the Gaussian local-field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integer $\kappa \geq 2$, the $\kappa$-local-field equation ($\kappa$-LFE) characterizes the limit of the neighborhood path empirical measure of interacting diffusions on $\kappa$-regular random graphs, as the graph size goes to infinity. It has been conjectured that the long-time behavior of the (in general non-Markovian) $\kappa$-LFE coincides with that of a certain more tractable Markovian analog, the Markov $\kappa$-local-field equation. In the present article, we prove this conjecture for the case when $\kappa = 2$ and the diffusions are one-dimensional with affine drifts. As a by-product of our proof, we also show that for interacting diffusions on the $n$-cycle (or 2-regular random graph on $n$ vertices), the limits $n \rightarrow \infty$ and $t\rightarrow \infty$ commute. Along the way, we also establish well-posedness of the Markov $\kappa$-local field equations with affine drifts for all $\kappa \geq 2$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Co-evolving vertex and edge dynamics in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random graph in which vertices can have one of two possible colours. Each vertex switches its colour at a rate that is proportional to the number of vertices of the other colour to which it is connected by an edge. Each edge turns on or off according to a rate that depends on whether the vertices at its two endpoints have the same colour or not. We prove that, in the limit as the graph size tends to infinity and the graph becomes dense, the graph process converges, in a suitable path topology, to a limiting Markov process that lives on a certain subset of the space of coloured graphons. In the limit, the density of each vertex colour evolves according to a Fisher-Wright diffusion driven by the density of the edges, while the underlying edge connectivity structure evolves according to a stochastic flow whose drift depends on the densities of the two vertex colours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a random variable that takes its values in $\frac{1}{q}\mathbb{Z}$, for some integer $q\ge2$, and consider $X$ rounded to an integer, either downwards or upwards or to the nearest integer. We give general formulas for the characteristic function and moments of the rounded variable. These formulas complement the related but different formulas in the case that $X$ has a continuous distribution, which was studied by Janson (2006).</description>

      <title>Quantitative Halmos-Savage theorems and robust large financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative version of the classical Halmos-Savage theorem for convex sets of probability measures and its dual counterpart, generalizing previous quantitative versions. These results are then used to derive robust versions of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) in large financial markets in discrete time, characterizing the absence of arbitrage under Knightian uncertainty. To this end, we consider robust formulations of no asymptotic arbitrage of first kind (NAA1), which is the large market analogue of ``No unbounded profit with bounded risk'' (NUPBR), as well as no asymptotic arbitrage of second kind (NAA2). We illustrate our theoretical results with an example of a sequence of robust binomial models converging to a robust Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress on the understanding of the Random Conductance Model is reviewed. A particular emphasis is on homogenization results such as functional central limit theorems, local limit theorems and heat kernel estimates for almost every realization of the environment, established for random walks among stationary ergodic conductances that are possibly unbounded but satisfy certain moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Unparalleled instances of prolifickness, random walks, and square root boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of influencing the sex ratio of a population by subjecting reproduction of each family to some stopping rule. As an easy consequence of the strong law of large numbers, no such modification is possible in the sense that the ratio converges to 1 almost surely, for any stopping rule that is finite almost surely. We proceed to quantify the effects and provide limit distributions for the properly rescaled sex ratio. Besides the total ratio, which is predominantly considered in the pertinent literature, we also analyze the average sex ratio, which may converge to values different from 1. The first part of this note is largely expository, applying classical results and standard methods from the fluctuation theory of random walks. In the second part we apply tail asymptotics for the time at which a random walk hits a one-sided square root boundary, exhibit the differences to the corresponding two-sided problem, and use a limit law related to the empirical dispersion coefficient of a heavy-tailed distribution. Finally, we derive a large deviations result for a special stopping strategy, using saddle point asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric splitting of one-dimensional noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric random walk $X$ whose jumps have diffuse law, looked at up to an independent geometric random time, splits at the minimum into two independent and identically distributed pieces. The same for the maxima. It is natural to ask, are there any other times ``adapted'' to $X$ exhibiting this ``symmetric splitting'' property? It appears that the phenomenon is most conveniently couched in terms of the ``noise'' structure associated to $X$. At the level of generality of the latter, an equivalent set-theoretic condition for the symmetric splitting property is provided, leading to the observation that the answer to the elucidated question is to the affirmative. While we do not deal much with the obvious analog of the phenomenon in continuous time, the discrete findings do beg the question: does linear Brownian motion admit times of symmetric splitting other than the maxima and minima? This is left unresolved, but we do make some comments as to why it may be non-trivial/interesting.</description>

      <title>Mixing trichotomy for random walks on directed stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a directed version of the classical Stochastic Block Model with $m\ge 2$ communities and a parameter $\alpha$ controlling the inter-community connectivity. We show that, depending on the scaling of $\alpha$, the mixing time of the random walk on this graph can exhibit three different behaviors, which we refer to as subcritical, critical and supercritical. In the subcritical regime, the total variation distance to equilibrium decays abruptly, providing the occurrence of the so-called cutoff phenomenon. In the supercritical regime, the mixing is governed by the inter-community jumps, and the random walk exhibits a metastable behavior: at first it collapses to a local equilibrium, then, on a larger timescale, it can be effectively described as a mean-field process on the $m$ communities, with a decay to equilibrium which is asymptotically smooth and exponential. Finally, for the critical regime, we show a sort of interpolation of the two above-mentioned behaviors. Although the metastable behavior shown in the supercritical regime appears natural from a heuristic standpoint, a substantial part of our analysis can be read as a control on the homogenization of the underlying random environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of [M. Biskup &amp; O. Louidor, Adv. Math. 330 (2018)], we study the local structure of $\star$-scale invariant fields -- a class of log-correlated Gaussian fields -- around their extremal points by characterising the law of the "shape" of the field's configuration near such points. As a consequence, we obtain a refined understanding of the freezing phenomenon in supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>Extremal Planar Matchings of Inhomogenous Random Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study maximum size and minimum weight planar matchings of inhomogenous random bipartite graphs. Our motivation for this study comes from efficient usage of cross edges in relay networks for overall improvement in network performance. We first consider Bernoulli planar matchings with a constraint on the edge length and obtain deviation estimates for the maximum size of a planar matching. We then equip each edge of the complete bipartite graph with a positive random weight and obtain bounds on the minimum weight of a planar matching containing a given number of edges. We also use segmentation and martingale methods to obtain~\(L^2-\)convergence of the minimum weight, appropriately scaled and centred.</description>

We call the resulting graph as a \emph{relay} RGG and determine sufficient conditions under such relay RGGs exist and are also near optimal, in terms of the graph parameters of~\(\Gamma.\) We then equip edges of~\(G\) with independent, exponentially distributed weights and obtain bounds for the maximum possible weight~\(W_n\) of a relay RGG with a given length~\(L_n.\)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for systemic risk modeling in insurance portfolios using jointly exchangeable arrays, extending classical collective risk models to account for interactions. We establish central limit theorems that asymptotically characterize total portfolio losses, providing a theoretical foundation for approximations in large portfolios and over long time horizons. These approximations are validated through simulation-based numerical experiments. Additionally, we analyze the impact of dependence on portfolio loss distributions, with a particular focus on tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Boundary Value Problems for p-Adic Elliptic Parisi-Z\'u\~niga Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic integral-differential operators resembling the classical elliptic partial differential equations are defined over a compact d-dimensional p-adic domain together with associated Sobolev spaces relying on coordinate Vladimirov-type Laplacians dating back to an idea of Wilson Z\'u\~niga-Galindo in his previous work. The associated Poisson equations under boundary conditions are solved and their $L_2$-spectra are determined. Under certain finiteness conditions, a Markov semigroup acting on the Sobolev spaces which are also Hilbert spaces can be associated with such an operator and the boundary condition. It is shown that this also has an explicitly given heat kernel as an $L_2$-function, which allows a Green function to be derived from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local (in time) expansion of a continuous-time process and its conditional moments, including the process' characteristic function. The expansions are conducted by using the properties of the (time-extended) Ito signature, a tractable basis composed of iterated integrals of the driving deterministic and stochastic signals: time, multiple correlated Brownian motions and multiple correlated compound Poisson processes. We show that these properties are conducive to automated expansions to any order with explicit coefficients and, therefore, to stochastic representations in which asymptotics can be conducted for a shrinking time (t to 0), as in the extant continuous-time econometrics literature, but, also, for a fixed time (such that t smaller than 1) with a diverging expansion order. The latter design opens up novel opportunities for identifying deep characteristics of the assumed process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of stochastic variational principles involves the problem of constructing fixed-endpoint and adapted variations of semimartingales. We provide a detailed construction of variations of semimartingales that are not only fixed at deterministic endpoints, but also fixed at first entry times and first exit times for charts in a manifold. We prove a stochastic version of the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations in the context of these variations. Using this framework, we provide a generalization of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle in local coordinates to arbitrary noise semimartingales. For the corresponding global form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we introduce a novel approach to global variational principles by restricting to semimartingales obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations.</description>

      <title>Estimation of rates in population-age-dependent processes by means of test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop practical applications of the model for the highly technical measure-valued populations developed by the authors in \cite{FanEtal20}. We consider the problem of estimation of parameters in the general age and population-dependent model, in which the individual birth and death rates depend not only on the age of the individual but also on the whole population composition. We derive new estimators of the rates based on the use of test functions in the functional Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for populations with a large carrying capacity. We consider the rates to be simple functions, that take finitely many values both in age $x$ and measure $A$, which leads to systems of linear equations. The proposed method of using test functions for estimation is a radically new approach which can be applied to a wide range of models of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Free Random Projection for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical inductive biases are hypothesized to promote generalizable policies in reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by explicit hyperbolic latent representations and architectures. Therefore, a more flexible approach is to have these biases emerge naturally from the algorithm. We introduce Free Random Projection, an input mapping grounded in free probability theory that constructs random orthogonal matrices where hierarchical structure arises inherently. The free random projection integrates seamlessly into existing in-context reinforcement learning frameworks by encoding hierarchical organization within the input space without requiring explicit architectural modifications. Empirical results on multi-environment benchmarks show that free random projection consistently outperforms the standard random projection, leading to improvements in generalization. Furthermore, analyses within linearly solvable Markov decision processes and investigations of the spectrum of kernel random matrices reveal the theoretical underpinnings of free random projection's enhanced performance, highlighting its capacity for effective adaptation in hierarchically structured state spaces.</description>

Abstract: For better learning, large datasets are often split into small batches and fed sequentially to the predictive model. In this paper, we study such batch decompositions from a probabilistic perspective. We assume that data points (possibly corrupted) are drawn independently from a given space and define a concept of similarity between two data points. We then consider decompositions that restrict the amount of similarity within each batch and obtain high probability bounds for the minimum size. We demonstrate an inherent tradeoff between relaxing the similarity constraint and the overall size and also use martingale methods to obtain bounds for the maximum size of data subsets with a given similarity.</description>

      <title>A geometric ensemble method for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional approximations to Bayesian inference rely on either approximations by statistics such as mean and covariance or by point particles. Recent advances such as the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter have generalized these notions to sums of parameterized distributions. This work presents a new methodology for approximating Bayesian inference by sums of uniform distributions on convex polytopes. The methodology presented herein is developed from the simplest convex polytope filter that takes advantage of uniform prior and measurement uncertainty, to an operationally viable ensemble filter with Kalmanized approximations to updating convex polytopes. Numerical results on the Ikeda map show the viability of this methodology in the low-dimensional setting, and numerical results on the Lorenz '96 equations similarly show viability in the high-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Sculpting Subspaces: Constrained Full Fine-Tuning in LLMs for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) is prone to catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks significantly degrades performance on previously learned ones. Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models.</description>

      <title>On $k$-clusters of high-intensity random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k,d $ be positive integers. We determine a sequence of constants that are asymptotic to the probability that the cluster at the origin in a $d$-dimensional Poisson Boolean model with balls of fixed radius is of order $k$, as the intensity becomes large. Using this, we determine the asymptotics of the mean of the number of components of order $k$, denoted $S_{n,k}$ in a random geometric graph on $n$ uniformly distributed vertices in a smoothly bounded compact region of $R^d$, with distance parameter $r(n)$ chosen so that the expected degree grows slowly as $n$ becomes large (the so-called mildly dense limiting regime). We also show that the variance of $S_{n,k}$ is asymptotic to its mean, and prove Poisson and normal approximation results for $S_{n,k}$ in this limiting regime. We provide analogous results for the corresponding Poisson process (i.e. with a Poisson number of points).
  We also give similar results in the so-called mildly sparse limiting regime where $r(n)$ is chosen so the expected degree decays slowly to zero as $n $ becomes large.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems describing isolation by distance under various forms of power-law dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover new asymptotic isolation by distance patterns occurring under long-range dispersal of offspring. We extend a recent work of the first author, in which this information was obtained from forwards-in-time dynamics using a novel stochastic partial differential equations approach for spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot models. The latter were introduced by Barton, Etheridge and V\'eber as a framework to model the evolution of the genetic composition of a spatially structured population. Reproduction takes place through extinction-recolonisation events driven by a Poisson point process. During an event, in certain ball-shaped areas, a parent is sampled and a proportion of the population is replaced. We generalize the previous approach of the first author by allowing the area from which a parent is sampled during events to differ from the area in which offspring are dispersed, and the radii of these regions follow power-law distributions. In particular, while in previous works the motion of ancestral lineages and coalescence behaviour were closely linked, we demonstrate that local and non-local coalescence is possible for ancestral lineages governed by both fractional and standard Laplacians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two interacting particles on the circle. The particles are subject to stochastic forcing, which is modeled by white noise. In addition, one of the particles is subject to friction, which models energy dissipation due to the interaction with the environment. We show that, in the diffusive limit, the absolute value of the velocity of the other particle converges to the reflected Brownian motion. In other words, the interaction between the particles are asymptotically negligible in the scaling limit. The proof combines averaging for large energies with large deviation estimates for small energies.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove equicontinuity for the family of one-point densities with respect to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas at an inverse temperature $\beta\ge 1/2$ confined by an external potential of Hele-Shaw (or quasi-harmonic) type. As a consequence, subsequential limiting Lipschitz continuous densities are defined on the microscopic scale. There are several additional results, for example comparing the one-point density with the thermal equilibrium density.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new model of textures, obtained as realizations of a new class of fractional Brownian fields. These fields, called weighted tensorized fractional Brownian fields, are obtained by a relaxation of the tensor-product structure that appears in the definition of fractional Brownian sheets. Statistical properties such as self-similarity, stationarity of rectangular increments and regularity properties are obtained. An operator scaling extension is defined and we provide simulations of the fields using their spectral representation.</description>

      <title>A quadratic BSDE approach to normalization for the finite volume 2D sine-Gordon model in the finite ultraviolet regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a new construction of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model on bounded domains by a novel normalization technique in the finite ultraviolet regime. Our methodology involves a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs for short) driven by a cylindrical Wiener process, whose generators are purely quadratic functions of the second unknown variable. The terminal conditions of the quadratic BSDEs are uniformly bounded and converge in probability to the real part of imaginary multiplicative chaos tested against an arbitrarily given test function, which helps us describe our sine-Gordon measure through some delicate estimates concerning bounded mean oscillation martingales. As the ultraviolet cutoffs are vanishing, the quadratic BSDEs converge to a quadratic BSDE that completely characterizes the absolute continuity of our sine-Gordon measure with respect to the law of Gaussian free fields. Our approach can also be used effectively to establish the connection between our sine-Gordon measure and the scaling limit of correlation functions of the critical planar XOR-Ising model and to prove the weak convergence of the normalized charge distributions of two-dimensional log-gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by its connection to the limit behaviour of imprecise Markov chains, we introduce and study the so-called convergence of upper transition operators: the condition that for any function, the orbit resulting from iterated application of this operator converges. In contrast, the existing notion of `ergodicity' requires convergence of the orbit to a constant. We derive a very general (and practically verifiable) sufficient condition for convergence in terms of accessibility and lower reachability, and prove that this sufficient condition is also necessary whenever (i) all transient states are absorbed or (ii) the upper transition operator is finitely generated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_{\mathrm{H}}} p^{e_{\mathrm{H}}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $e_{\mathrm{H}}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean, for any strictly balanced graph $\mathrm{H}$. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability. This work further identifies the typical structures of $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ conditioned on upper tail rare events in the localized regime.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR($\infty$) processes and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel link between nearly unstable cumulative heavy-tailed integer-valued autoregressive (INAR($\infty$)) processes and the rough Heston model via discrete scaling limits. We prove that a sequence of bivariate cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes converge in law to the rough Heston model under appropriate scaling conditions, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how microstructural order flow drives macroscopic prices following rough volatility dynamics. Our theoretical framework extends the scaling limit techniques from Hawkes processes to the INAR($\infty$) setting. Hence we can carry out efficient Monte Carlo simulation of the rough Heston model through simulating the corresponding approximating INAR($\infty$) processes, which provides an alternative discrete-time simulation method to the Euler-Maruyama method. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed simulation scheme as compared to the literature, in the valuation of European options, and also path-dependent options such as arithmetic Asian options, lookback options and barrier options.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general non-linear model where the signal is a finite mixture of an unknown, possibly increasing, number of features issued from a continuous dictionary parameterized by a real non-linear parameter. The signal is observed with Gaussian (possibly correlated) noise in either a continuous or a discrete setup. We propose an off-the-grid optimization method, that is, a method which does not use any discretization scheme on the parameter space, to estimate both the non-linear parameters of the features and the linear parameters of the mixture. We use recent results on the geometry of off-the-grid methods to give minimal separation on the true underlying non-linear parameters such that interpolating certificate functions can be constructed. Using also tail bounds for suprema of Gaussian processes we bound the prediction error with high probability. Assuming that the certificate functions can be constructed, our prediction error bound is up to $\log$-factors similar to the rates attained by the Lasso predictor in the linear regression model. We also establish convergence rates that quantify with high probability the quality of estimation for both the linear and the non-linear parameters. We develop in full details our main results for two applications: the Gaussian spike deconvolution and the scaled exponential model.</description>

      <title>Normal approximations for the multivariate inverse Gaussian distribution and asymmetric kernel smoothing on $d$-dimensional half-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel density estimator supported on $d$-dimensional half-spaces. It stands out as the first asymmetric kernel density estimator for half-spaces in the literature. Using the multivariate inverse Gaussian (MIG) density from Minami (2003) as the kernel and incorporating locally adaptive parameters, the estimator achieves desirable boundary properties. To analyze its mean integrated squared error (MISE) and asymptotic normality, a local limit theorem and probability metric bounds are established between the MIG and the corresponding multivariate Gaussian distribution with the same mean vector and covariance matrix, which may also be of independent interest. Additionally, a new algorithm for generating MIG random vectors is developed, proving to be faster and more accurate than Minami's algorithm based on a Brownian first-hitting location representation. This algorithm is then used to discuss and compare optimal MISE and likelihood cross-validation bandwidths for the estimator in a simulation study under various target distributions. As an application, the MIG asymmetric kernel is used to smooth the posterior distribution of a generalized Pareto model fitted to large electromagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs classical Markov chains; Exactly solvable examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coinless quantisation procedure of general reversible Markov chains on graphs is presented. A quantum Hamiltonian H is obtained by a similarity transformation of the fundamental transition probability matrix K in terms of the square root of the reversible distribution. The evolution of the classical and quantum Markov chains is described by the solutions of the eigenvalue problem of the quantum Hamiltonian H. About twenty plus exactly solvable Markov chains based on the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, derived by Odake-Sasaki, would provide a good window for scrutinising the quantum/classical contrast of Markov chains. Among them five explicit examples, related to the Krawtchouk, Hahn, q-Hahn, Charlier and Meixner, are demonstrated to illustrate the actual calculations.</description>

      <title>Impact of heterogeneity on infection probability: Insights from single-hit dose-response models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and within-host microbial infection models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a within-host microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Problem Arising in Sailboat Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the optimal control problem for a sailboat aiming to reach an upwind buoy, assuming that the wind speed is constant and the wind direction follows a Brownian motion. The yacht navigates in $\R^2$ and the target is a ball of radius $\eta &gt;0$ centered at the origin. We derive the equations of motion and provide their closed-form solution. The yacht is subject to a tacking cost $c\geq 0$. We define two control problems, one where $c=0$ and another where $c&gt;0$. For both cases, we establish an analytical upper bound on the value function by constructing a strategy that enables the yacht to reach the buoy within a finite expected number of tacks. For the case with $c = 0$, where no tacking cost applies, we conjecture an optimal strategy which may involve an infinite number of tacks. The controlled state equation has non-continuous coefficients so standard results on existence and uniqueness of a strong solution do not apply. We provide a proof using the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

      <title>Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for Laplace's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Locally Stationary Distributions: A Framework for Analyzing Slow-Mixing Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural Markov chains fail to mix to their stationary distribution in polynomially many steps. Often, this slow mixing is inevitable since it is computationally intractable to sample from their stationary measure.
  Nevertheless, Markov chains can be shown to always converge quickly to measures that are locally stationary, i.e., measures that don't change over a small number of steps. These locally stationary measures are analogous to local minima in continuous optimization, while stationary measures correspond to global minima.
  While locally stationary measures can be statistically far from stationary measures, do they enjoy provable theoretical guarantees that have algorithmic implications? We study this question in this work and demonstrate three algorithmic applications of locally stationary measures:
  1. We show that Glauber dynamics on the hardcore model can be used to find independent sets of size $\Omega\left(\frac{\log d}{d} \cdot n\right)$ in triangle-free graphs of degree at most $d$.
  2. Let $W$ be a symmetric real matrix with bounded spectral diameter and $v$ be a unit vector. Given the matrix $M = \lambda vv^\top + W$ with a planted rank-one spike along vector $v$, for sufficiently large constant $\lambda$, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the vector $v$.
  3. Let $M = A_{\mathbf{G}} - \frac{d}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top$ be a centered version of the adjacency matrix where the graph $\mathbf{G}$ is drawn from a sparse 2-community stochastic block model. We show that for sufficiently large constant signal-to-noise ratio, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the hidden community vector $\mathbf{\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Sampling from mixture distributions based on regime-switching diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>
