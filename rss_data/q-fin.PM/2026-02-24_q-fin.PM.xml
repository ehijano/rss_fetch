      <title>Overreaction as an indicator for momentum in algorithmic trading: A Case of AAPL stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether short-term market overreactions can be systematically predicted and monetized as momentum signals using high-frequency emotional information and modern machine learning methods. Focusing on Apple Inc. (AAPL), we construct a comprehensive intraday dataset that combines volatility normalized returns with transformer-based emotion features extracted from Twitter messages. Overreactions are defined as extreme return realizations relative to contemporaneous volatility and transaction costs and are modeled as a three-class prediction problem. We evaluate the performance of several nonlinear classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Bidirectional LSTMs, across multiple intraday frequencies (1, 5, 10, and 15 minute data). Model outputs are translated into trading strategies and assessed using risk-adjusted performance measures and formal statistical tests. The results show that machine learning models significantly outperform benchmark overreaction rules at ultra short horizons, while classical behavioral momentum effects dominate at intermediate frequencies, particularly around 10 minutes. Explainability analysis based on SHAP reveals that volatility and negative emotions, especially fear and sadness, play a central role in driving predicted overreactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate that emotion-driven overreactions contain a predictable structure that can be exploited by machine learning models, offering new insights into the behavioral origins of intraday momentum and the interaction between sentiment, volatility, and algorithmic trading.</description>

      <title>Is Causality Necessary for Efficient Portfolios? A Computational Perspective on Predictive Validity and Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is increasingly argued to require causally identified return predictors to avoid signal inversion and optimization failure. This paper re-examines this claim by studying when predictive signals yield viable efficient frontiers, even under structural misspecification. We show that causal identification is not necessary for portfolio efficiency within static mean--variance and closely related quadratic portfolio optimization frameworks. Instead, efficiency is governed by geometric sufficiency conditions on predictive signals: directional alignment, ranking preservation, and calibration. We formally decompose portfolio efficiency into these three components and show that miscalibration alone attenuates Sharpe ratios even when alignment and ranking are preserved. Robustness is characterized as smooth degradation rather than collapse, with explicit attenuation behavior and continuity of performance under increasing misspecification. The theoretical results are supported by simulations and empirical analysis. Empirical validation combines equity-based illustrations with a large global bond universe spanning multiple currencies, countries, sectors, maturities along the term structure, seniority classes, and credit ratings, together with high-dimensional stress tests, nonlinear data-generating processes, rolling-window analyses, covariance regularization, realistic portfolio constraints, and bootstrap-based statistical validation. Across these settings, optimization geometry remains well-behaved whenever directional alignment is preserved. The results clarify the boundary between causality and portfolio optimization: causality may inform signal representation, but portfolio efficiency at the optimization stage is a geometric property conditional on a given representation.</description>
