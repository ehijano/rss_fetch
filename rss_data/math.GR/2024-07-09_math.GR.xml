      <title>The semi-simple theory of higher rank acylindricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new notion of non-positively curved groups: the collection of discrete countable groups acting (AU-)acylindrically on finite products of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with general type factors. Inspired by the classical theory of ($S$-arithmetic) lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, we show that, up to virtual isomorphism, finitely generated groups in this class enjoy a strongly canonical product decomposition. This semi-simple decomposition also descends to the outer-automorphism group, allowing us to give a partial resolution to a recent conjecture of Sela. We also develop various structure results including a free vs abelian Tits' Alternative, and connections to lattice envelopes. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-1 setting.
  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains, for example, $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-1 factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, HHGs, groups with property (QT), and is closed under direct products, passing to (totally general type) subgroups, and finite index over-groups.</description>

      <title>Boundary values of diffeomorphisms of simple polytopes, and controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a convex polytope with non-empty interior in a finite dimensional vector space, such that each vertex of $M$ is contained in exactly $n$ edges of $M$. The Lie group of all smooth diffeomorphisms of $M$ contains the Lie subgroup of all diffeomorphisms which restrict to the identity on the boundary of the polytope. We give the quotient of the diffeomorphism group mod subgroup a Lie group structure. This construction turns the canonical quotient homomorphism into a smooth submersion, and we then obtain related results. We also study controllability on $M$ and show that the identity component of the diffeomorphism group is generated by the exponential image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that if $G$ is a group and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of finite index $k$, then $x^k \in H$ for every $x \in G$. We examine finite groups $G$ with the property that $x^k \in H$ for every subgroup $H$ of $G$, where $k$ is the index of $H$ in $G$. We prove that a finite group $G$ satisfies this property if and only if $G$ is nilpotent.</description>

Abstract: We show that every finitely generated residually finite torsion group $G$ embeds in a finitely generated torsion group $\Gamma$ that is residually finite simple. In particular we show the existence of finitely generated infinite torsion groups that are residually finite simple, which answers a question of Olshanskii and Osin.</description>

      <title>Special cases on the relative rank of G-equivariant functions over an infinite G-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the action of a group $G$ on a set $ X $ , the set of $ G $ -equivariant functions, those that commute with the action, i.e., $ f(g \cdot x) = g \cdot f(x) $ for all $ x \in X $ , $ g \in G $ , forms a monoid under function composition. It is known that when a finite group $ G $ acts on a finite set $ X $ , a finite number of elements in this monoid are sufficient to generate it along with its group of units. The minimum number of elements required to generate the monoid is called the relative rank. This paper presents two particular cases where $ G $ is a finite group, $ X $ is an infinite set, and the relative rank of the monoid of $ G $ -equivariant functions is finite; moreover, we compute it.</description>

      <title>Differentials on Forested and Hairy Graph Complexes with Dishonest Hairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of forested graph complexes with ordered and unordered hairs whose cohomology computes the cohomology of a family of groups $\Gamma_{g,r}$ that generalize the (outer) automorphism group of free groups. We give examples and a recipe for constructing additional differentials on these complexes. These differentials can be used to construct spectral sequences that start with the cohomology of the standard complexes. We focus on one such sequence that relates cohomology classes of graphs with different numbers of hairs and compute its limit.</description>

      <title>A Continued Fractions Theory for the completion of the Puiseux field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a continued fractions theory for the topological completion of the field of Puiseux series. As usual, we prove that any element in the completion can be developed as a unique continued fractions, whose coefficients are polynomials in roots of the variable, and that this approximation is the best ''rational'' Diophantine approximation of such element. Then, we interpret the preceding result in terms of the action of a suitable arithmetic subgroup of the special linear group on the Berkovich space defined over the said completion. We also explore the connections between points of type IV of the Berkovich space in terms of some ''non-convergent'' or ''undefined'' continued fractions, in a sense that we make precise in the text.</description>

      <title>Pairs of separably closed fields and exotic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at simple groups associated primarily with the general theory of Moufang buildings, and to analyze their relation to stability theory in the model theoretic sense. As it becomes quite technical in the details, a lengthy introduction surveys the developments at a less detailed level.
  The text, beginning from the second section, first deals with some model theoretic algebra of fields, followed by an extended study of three associated families of simple groups coming from the theory of Tits buildings, Moufang polygons, and Timmesfeld's theory of exotic analogs of SL_2.
  The field theoretic part is fundamental ({\S}2). The rest of the paper relates this to group theoretic constructions, with two sections surveying the consequences for the original Tits and Timmesfeld theory before concentrating on the more exotic groups associated with Moufang polygons.
  A good deal of the group theoretical material is expository, aimed to make the relevant structural information meaningful to those coming from the direction of model theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Sofic Approximations Of Countable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable group G is called k-linear sofic (for some 0 &lt;k \le 1) if finite subsets of G admit "approximate representations" by complex invertible matrices in the normalized rank metric, so that non-identity elements are k-away from the identity. This class of groups was systematically studied by Arzhantseva and Paunescu [AP17], where it is shown that such a group is always 1/4-linear sofic. In this paper, we will study the optimality of this result for general countable groups and show that every linear sofic group is 1/2-linear sofic, and 1/2 cannot be improved. However, if G is assumed to be torsion-free, then it is 1-linear sofic. These results answer a question posed by G. Arzhantseva in her talk in the IAS Stability and Testability lecture series. We also study the optimal linear sofic constant of finite groups over C and fields of positive characteristic. For the proof, we establish effective non-concentration estimates for random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, which may be of independent interest. Another ingredient of the proof involves bounding integrals of certain trigonometric sums.</description>

      <title>Unimodular totally disconnected locally compact groups of rational discrete cohomological dimension one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a Stallings--Swan theorem holds in a totally disconnected locally compact (= t.d.l.c.) context (cf. Thm. B). More precisely, a compactly generated $\mathcal{CO}$-bounded t.d.l.c. group $G$ of rational discrete cohomological dimension less than or equal to $1$ must be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a finite graph of profinite groups. This result generalises Dunwoody's rational version of the classical Stallings--Swan theorem to t.d.l.c. groups. The proof of Theorem B is based on the fact that a compactly generated unimodular t.d.l.c. group with rational discrete cohomological dimension $1$ has necessarily non-positive Euler--Poincar\'e characteristic (cf. Thm. G).</description>

      <title>On the critical regularity of nilpotent groups acting on the interval: the metabelian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a torsion-free, finitely-generated, nilpotent and metabelian group. In this work we show that $G$ embeds into the group of orientation preserving $C^{1+\alpha}$-diffeomorphisms of the compact interval, for all $\alpha&lt; 1/k$ where $k$ is the torsion-free rank of $G/A$ and $A$ is a maximal abelian subgroup. We show that in many situations the corresponding $1/k$ is critical in the sense that there is no embedding of $G$ with higher regularity. A particularly nice family where this happens, is the family of $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg groups, for which we can show that the critical regularity equals $1+1/n$.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic K-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L\"oh; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We say that $H$ is extremely closed in $G$ if $\langle H,H^g\rangle\cap N_G(H)=H$ for all $g\in G.$ In this paper, we determine the structure of finite groups with an extremely closed abelian $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$. In particular, we show that if $G$ contains such a subgroup $H$, then $G=N_G(H)O_{p'}(G).$ This is a variant on the celebrated Glauberman's $Z^*$-Theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze computational properties of the Diophantine problem (and its search variant) for spherical equations $\prod_{i=1}^m z_i^{-1} c_i z_i = 1$ (and its variants) over the class of finite metabelian groups $G_{p,n}=\mathbb{Z}_p^n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_p^\ast$, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $p$ is prime. We prove that the problem of finding solutions for certain constrained spherical equations is computationally hard on average (assuming that some lattice approximation problem is hard in the worst case).</description>

Abstract: For all algebraic groups over non-Archimedean local fields, the bounded cohomology vanishes. This follows from the corresponding statement for automorphism groups of Bruhat--Tits buildings, which hinges on the solution to the flatmate conjecture raised in earlier work with Bucher. Vanishing and invariance theorems for arithmetic groups are derived.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>
