      <title>qIoV: A Quantum-Driven Internet-of-Vehicles-Based Approach for Environmental Monitoring and Rapid Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses the critical necessity for advanced rapid response operations in managing a spectrum of environmental hazards. We propose a novel framework, qIoV that integrates quantum computing with the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) to leverage the computational efficiency, parallelism, and entanglement properties of quantum mechanics. Our approach involves the use of environmental sensors mounted on vehicles for precise air quality assessment. These sensors are designed to be highly sensitive and accurate, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to detect and measure environmental parameters. A salient feature of our proposal is the Quantum Mesh Network Fabric (QMF), a system designed to dynamically adjust the quantum network topology in accordance with vehicular movements. This capability is critical to maintaining the integrity of quantum states against environmental and vehicular disturbances, thereby ensuring reliable data transmission and processing. Moreover, our methodology is further augmented by the incorporation of a variational quantum classifier (VQC) with advanced quantum entanglement techniques. This integration offers a significant reduction in latency for hazard alert transmission, thus enabling expedited communication of crucial data to emergency response teams and the public. Our study on the IBM OpenQSAM 3 platform, utilizing a 127 Qubit system, revealed significant advancements in pair plot analysis, achieving over 90% in precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics and an 83% increase in the speed of toxic gas detection compared to conventional methods.Additionally, theoretical analyses validate the efficiency of quantum rotation, teleportation protocols, and the fidelity of quantum entanglement, further underscoring the potential of quantum computing in enhancing analytical performance.</description>

      <title>On Optimizing Hyperparameters for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) models go hand in hand with an immense amount of data and computational power required for training. Therefore, training is usually outsourced into HPC facilities, where we have started to experience limits in scaling conventional HPC hardware, as theorized by Moore's law. Despite heavy parallelization and optimization efforts, current state-of-the-art ML models require weeks for training, which is associated with an enormous $CO_2$ footprint. Quantum Computing, and specifically Quantum Machine Learning (QML), can offer significant theoretical speed-ups and enhanced expressive power. However, training QML models requires tuning various hyperparameters, which is a nontrivial task and suboptimal choices can highly affect the trainability and performance of the models. In this study, we identify the most impactful hyperparameters and collect data about the performance of QML models. We compare different configurations and provide researchers with performance data and concrete suggestions for hyperparameter selection.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear behavior of memristive devices for hardware security primitives and neuromorphic computing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinearity is a crucial characteristic for implementing hardware security primitives or neuromorphic computing systems. The main feature of all memristive devices is this nonlinear behavior observed in their current-voltage characteristics. To comprehend the nonlinear behavior, we have to understand the coexistence of resistive, capacitive, and inertia (virtual inductive) effects in these devices. These effects originate from corresponding physical and chemical processes in memristive devices. A physics-inspired compact model is employed to model and simulate interface-type RRAMs such as Au/BiFeO$_{3}$/Pt/Ti, Au/Nb$_{\rm x}$O$_{\rm y}$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Nb, while accounting for the modeling of capacitive and inertia effects. The simulated current-voltage characteristics align well with experimental data and accurately capture the non-zero crossing hysteresis generated by capacitive and inductive effects. This study examines the response of two devices to increasing frequencies, revealing a shift in their nonlinear behavior characterized by a reduced hysteresis range and increased chaotic behavior, as observed through internal state attractors. Fourier series analysis utilizing a sinusoidal input voltage of varying amplitudes and frequencies indicates harmonics or frequency components that considerably influence the functioning of RRAMs. Moreover, we propose and demonstrate the use of the frequency spectra as one of the fingerprints for memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Solving a Real-World Package Delivery Routing Problem Using Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research focused on the conjunction between quantum computing and routing problems has been very prolific in recent years. Most of the works revolve around classical problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the Vehicle Routing Problem. Even though working on these problems is valuable, it is also undeniable that their academic-oriented nature falls short of real-world requirements. The main objective of this research is to present a solving method for realistic instances, avoiding problem relaxations or technical shortcuts. Instead, a quantum-classical hybrid solver has been developed, coined Q4RPD, that considers a set of real constraints such as a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, priority deliveries, and capacities characterized by two values: weight and dimensions of the packages. Q4RPD resorts to the Leap Constrained Quadratic Model Hybrid Solver of D-Wave. To demonstrate the application of Q4RPD, an experimentation composed of six different instances has been conducted, aiming to serve as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Fermihedral: On the Optimal Compilation for Fermion-to-Qubit Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fermihedral, a compiler framework focusing on discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios, this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses. Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.</description>
