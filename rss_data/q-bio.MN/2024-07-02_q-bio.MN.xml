      <title>Gene Regulatory Network Inference with Covariance Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining gene regulatory network (GRN) structure is a central problem in biology, with a variety of inference methods available for different types of data. For a widely prevalent and challenging use case, namely single-cell gene expression data measured after intervention at multiple time points with unknown joint distributions, there is only one known specifically developed method, which does not fully utilize the rich information contained in this data type. We develop an inference method for the GRN in this case, netWork infErence by covariaNce DYnamics, dubbed WENDY. The core idea of WENDY is to model the dynamics of the covariance matrix, and solve this dynamics as an optimization problem to determine the regulatory relationships. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare WENDY with other inference methods using synthetic data and experimental data. Our results demonstrate that WENDY performs well across different data sets.</description>

      <title>Immediate Neighbours of Monotone Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks constitute relevant mathematical models to study the behaviours of genetic and signalling networks. These networks define regulatory influences between molecular nodes, each being associated to a Boolean variable and a regulatory (local) function specifying its dynamical behaviour depending on its regulators. However, existing data is mostly insufficient to adequately parametrise a model, that is to uniquely define a regulatory function for each node. With the intend to support model parametrisation, this paper presents results on the set of Boolean functions compatible with a given regulatory structure, i.e. the partially ordered set of monotone non-degenerate Boolean functions. More precisely, we present original rules to obtain the direct neighbours of any function of this set. Besides a theoretical interest, presented results will enable the development of more efficient methods for Boolean network synthesis and revision, benefiting from the progressive exploration of the vicinity of regulatory functions.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis on Multi-Scale Bioprocess Stochastic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the pressing challenges in the digital twin development for biomanufacturing systems, we introduce an adjoint sensitivity analysis (SA) approach to expedite the learning of mechanistic model parameters. In this paper, we consider enzymatic stochastic reaction networks representing a multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model that allows us to integrate disparate data from diverse production processes and leverage the information from existing macro-kinetic and genome-scale models. To support forward prediction and backward reasoning, we develop a convergent adjoint SA algorithm studying how the perturbations of model parameters and inputs (e.g., initial state) propagate through enzymatic reaction networks and impact on output trajectory predictions. This SA can provide a sample efficient and interpretable way to assess the sensitivities between inputs and outputs accounting for their causal dependencies. Our empirical study underscores the resilience of these sensitivities and illuminates a deeper comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms behind bioprocess through sensitivities.</description>
