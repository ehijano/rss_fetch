      <title>LOKA Protocol: A Decentralized Framework for Trustworthy and Ethical AI Agent Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently, signals a profound shift in how digital ecosystems operate, govern, and evolve. As these agents proliferate beyond centralized infrastructures, they expose foundational gaps in identity, accountability, and ethical alignment. Three critical questions emerge: Identity: Who or what is the agent? Accountability: Can its actions be verified, audited, and trusted? Ethical Consensus: Can autonomous systems reliably align with human values and prevent harmful emergent behaviors? We present the novel LOKA Protocol (Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents), a unified, systems-level architecture for building ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. LOKA introduces a proposed Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL) for decentralized, verifiable identity; intent-centric communication protocols for semantic coordination across diverse agents; and a Decentralized Ethical Consensus Protocol (DECP) that enables agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in shared ethical baselines. Anchored in emerging standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and post-quantum cryptography, LOKA offers a scalable, future-resilient blueprint for multi-agent AI governance. By embedding identity, trust, and ethics into the protocol layer itself, LOKA establishes the foundation for a new era of responsible, transparent, and autonomous AI ecosystems operating across digital and physical domains.</description>

      <title>A Multi-UAV Formation Obstacle Avoidance Method Combined Improved Simulated Annealing and Adaptive Artificial Potential Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method exhibits limitations in its force distribution: excessive attraction when UAVs are far from the target may cause collisions with obstacles, while insufficient attraction near the goal often results in failure to reach the target. Furthermore, APF is highly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid obstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing mechanism with an enhanced APF model. The proposed approach integrates a Leader-Follower distributed formation strategy with the APF framework, where the resultant force formulation is redefined to smooth UAV trajectories. An adaptive gravitational gain function is introduced to dynamically adjust UAV velocity based on environmental context, and a fast-converging controller ensures accurate and efficient convergence to the target. Moreover, a directional deflection mechanism is embedded within the simulated annealing process, enabling UAVs to escape local minima caused by semi-enclosed obstacles through continuous rotational motion. The simulation results, covering formation reconfiguration, complex obstacle avoidance, and entrapment escape, demonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and superiority of the proposed DSA-AAPF algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.</description>

      <title>Toward Super Agent System with Hybrid AI Routers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Tissue Repair Through MARL with Reward Shaping and Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for optimizing tissue repair processes using engineered biological agents. Our approach integrates: (1) stochastic reaction-diffusion systems modeling molecular signaling, (2) neural-like electrochemical communication with Hebbian plasticity, and (3) a biologically informed reward function combining chemical gradient tracking, neural synchronization, and robust penalties. A curriculum learning scheme guides the agent through progressively complex repair scenarios. In silico experiments demonstrate emergent repair strategies, including dynamic secretion control and spatial coordination.</description>

      <title>Communication-aware Hierarchical Map Compression of Time-Varying Environments for Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for the time-sequential compression of dynamic probabilistic occupancy grids. Our approach leverages ideas from signal compression theory to formulate an optimization problem that searches for a multi-resolution hierarchical encoder that balances the quality of the compressed map (distortion) with its description size, the latter of which relates to the bandwidth required to reliably transmit the map to other agents or to store map estimates in on-board memory. The resulting optimization problem allows for multi-resolution map compressions to be obtained that satisfy available communication or memory resources, and does not require knowledge of the occupancy map dynamics. We develop an algorithm to solve our problem, and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in simulation on both static (i.e., non-time varying) and dynamic (time-varying) occupancy maps.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for training and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It spans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and multi-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via an online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with real-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that TextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in mind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework, testing models, playing against the models, and training models. Detailed documentation of environments, games, leaderboard, and examples are available on https://github.com/LeonGuertler/TextArena and https://www.textarena.ai/.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Pre-Planning Barrier: Adaptive Real-Time Coordination of Heterogeneous UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer significant potential in dynamic, perception-intensive tasks such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring; however, their effectiveness is severely restricted by conventional pre-planned routing methods, which lack the flexibility to respond in real-time to evolving task demands, unexpected disturbances, and localized view limitations in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework named \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{G}raph \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}ulti-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (HGAM), uniquely designed to enable adaptive real-time coordination between mission UAVs (MUAVs) and charging UAVs (CUAVs). HGAM specifically addresses the previously unsolved challenge of enabling precise, decentralized continuous-action coordination solely based on local, heterogeneous graph-based observations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HGAM substantially surpasses existing methods, achieving, for example, a 30\% improvement in data collection coverage and a 20\% increase in charging efficiency, providing crucial insights and foundations for the future deployment of intelligent, flexible UAV networks in complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Steering No-Regret Agents in MFGs under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incentive design is a popular framework for guiding agents' learning dynamics towards desired outcomes by providing additional payments beyond intrinsic rewards. However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the desired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the data-driven medicine approach, which integrates ethically managed and explainable artificial intelligence into clinical decision support systems (CDSS), are critical to ensure reliable and effective patient care. This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59%, 56%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</description>
