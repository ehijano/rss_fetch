      <title>The Myth of Causal Necessity: Misspecified Models in Mean-Variance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper challenges the claim that causal factor modeling is a necessary condition for investment efficiency. Through formal analysis and empirical counterexamples, we show that predictive models, even when structurally misspecified, can produce directionally accurate signals, valid mean-variance frontiers, and positive Sharpe ratios. Contrary to the assertion that causal omission leads to systematic inefficiency, we demonstrate that calibration errors, not lack of causal structure, are the primary source of performance degradation. Drawing from statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we argue that predictive validity, not causal interpretability, is the key metric in portfolio construction. Our theoretical results distinguish between signal ranking and sizing, and our experiments confirm that portfolio optimization remains viable even under omitted variables and nonlinearity. These findings support a predictive-first modeling philosophy: models may be wrong in structure, yet still useful in practice.</description>

      <title>Decision by Supervised Learning with Deep Ensembles: A Practical Framework for Robust Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Decision by Supervised Learning (DSL), a practical framework for robust portfolio optimization. DSL reframes portfolio construction as a supervised learning problem: models are trained to predict optimal portfolio weights, using cross-entropy loss and portfolios constructed by maximizing the Sharpe or Sortino ratio. To further enhance stability and reliability, DSL employs Deep Ensemble methods, substantially reducing variance in portfolio allocations. Through comprehensive backtesting across diverse market universes and neural architectures, shows superior performance compared to both traditional strategies and leading machine learning-based methods, including Prediction-Focused Learning and End-to-End Learning. We show that increasing the ensemble size leads to higher median returns and more stable risk-adjusted performance. The code is available at https://github.com/DSLwDE/DSLwDE.</description>
