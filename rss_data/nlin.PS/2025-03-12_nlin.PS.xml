      <title>Long-range interaction of kinks in higher-order polynomial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotic estimates of the interaction forces between kink and antikink in a family of field-theoretic models with two vacua in (1+1)-dimensional space-time. In our study we consider a new class of soliton solutions previously found in our paper [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 165 (2022) 112805]. We focus on the case of kinks having one exponential and one power-law asymptotics. We show that if the kink and antikink are faced each other with long-range tails, the force of attraction between them at large separations demonstrates a power-law decay with the distance. We also performed numerical simulations to measure the interaction force and obtained good agreement between the experimental values and theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of recurrence and spectral asymmetry of the two-component Akhmediev breathers in a single mode optical fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of experimental studies of recurrent spectral dynamics of the two component Akhmediev breathers (ABs) in a single mode optical fibre. We also provide the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the ABs based on the two component Manakov equations that confirm the experimental data. In particular, we observed spectral asymmetry of fundamental ABs and complex spectral evolution of second-order nondegenerate ABs.</description>

      <title>Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.
  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.</description>
