      <title>\nu-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Representation of Archimedean Networks and Inclusion: Computational Applications to Percolation and Network Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative geometric representation for the eleven Archimedean lattices, in which each site and bond is uniquely labeled by an ordered pair of integers and characterized via a modular function. This structured labeling enables efficient and systematic implementation of computational models on these lattices, without relying on ad hoc indexing, and provides a versatile framework for future studies on regular tilings.
  As an application, we obtain, for each Archimedean lattice, the phase diagrams generated by monomer deposition for the site-bond percolation models known in the literature as S \cup B and S \cap B. We show that these diagrams are ordered in phase space according to the partial and total inclusion relations among the lattices, as demonstrated by Parviainen et al. (2003).
  Furthermore, for the lattice pairs (3.6.3.6)/(3.4.6.4) and (3^3.4^2)/(3^2.4.3.4), we observe an inversion between the pure site and bond percolation thresholds. We show that this phenomenon is linked to the crossing of their respective phase diagrams, highlighting the sensitivity of critical behavior to lattice topology.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thickening Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial run-and-tumble particle moving in a shear-thickening medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is represented by a nonlinear function $f(v)\sim\tan(v)$, while a symmetric dichotomous noise of strength $\Sigma$ and flipping rate $\lambda$ models the activity of the particle. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distribution $W_{\pm\Sigma}(v, t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$ and the active force is $\pm\Sigma$, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $W_s(v)$ and a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$. For a fixed $\Sigma$, $W_s(v)$ undergoes multiple transitions with varying $\lambda$, and we have identified the corresponding transition points. We then numerically compute $W_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we test the robustness of the transitions in $W_s(v)$ by considering an alternative $f(v)$ function that also capture the shear-thickening behavior of the medium.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators-an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to achieve global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity in the distribution of field increments between avalanches in non-abelian random field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model with no passing violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature quasi-statically driven dynamics of the random field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model (RFBEGM) as a prototype for disordered systems with competing interactions. While the random field Ising model is known to obey the no-passing rule we show that this property is generically violated in the RFBEGM. By exploring the full parameter space, we identify the precise conditions under which no-passing is broken, particularly in the regime where a repulsive biquadratic coupling introduces frustration. Here, we find that this violation leaves a clear fingerprint in the form of a discontinuity in the distribution of the field increments between successive avalanches. We provide analytical arguments that locate the onset of this discontinuity, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced Quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an intriguing anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has recently attracted significant attention. However, how various types of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical framework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By investigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we find that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the relaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long correlation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain initial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a three-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter intuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Disordered XX Spin Chain: A Real-Space Renormalization Group Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e., non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$ and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.</description>

      <title>Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. Here, we study a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.</description>

      <title>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</description>

      <title>Effective one-dimension reduction of multi-compartment complex systems dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state, that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics, individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological and economic systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

      <title>Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.</description>

      <title>Perfectly hidden order and Z2 confinement transition in a fully packed monopole liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of spin ice whose degenerate ground states are densely packed monopole configurations. An applied field drives this model through a Z2 confinement transition. This phase change is a variant of the U(1) Kasteleyn transition, but instead of saturated order the system has fluctuations in the confined phase, and shows critical scaling on both sides of the transition. Remarkably, the magnetic response scales with the critical exponent of the specific heat in the 3D Ising universality class. We prove this universality using a Kramers--Wannier duality to map to an Ising model. The dual order parameter maps back to a non-local string order parameter in the original model, invisible to any local probe. Further, we describe the transition in terms of a bosonic field theory including a pairing term.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. We show that active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic, signed parameter with units of curvature which we call curvity, that can be derived from first principles. Experiments with robots and numerical simulations show that properties of individual robots (radius and curvity) control pair cohesion in a binary system, and the stability of flocking and self-limiting clustering in a swarm, with applications in meta-materials and in embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Long-range order in two-dimensional systems with fluctuating active stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional tissues, such as developing germ layers, pair-wise forces (or active stresses) arise from the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton, with dissipation provided by the three-dimensional surroundings. We show analytically how these pair-wise stochastic forces, unlike the particle-wise independent fluctuating forces usually considered in active matter systems, produce conserved centre-of-mass dynamics and so are able to damp large-wavelength displacement fluctuations in elastic systems. A consequence of this is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions, in clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence of hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \sim q^2$ in the $q \to 0$ limit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these pair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is represented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions and with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an active disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of equal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We study the melting transition of these models and find a first-order phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in the disk model with active stresses. We confirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models and show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus constituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of this mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and to also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained dynamics of entanglement in non-integrable quenches far across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding various aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and partly motivated by the practice of site-resolved control in contemporary ultracold experiments, we present numerical observations of several $\textit{fine-grained}$ (small-subsystem level) features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view, induced by quantum quenches far across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferro-magnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for three-spin and bigger subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local mutual information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>General theory of perturbation of infinite resistor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice. We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance. Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</description>

      <title>Pinning models with contact number constraint: the effect of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</description>
