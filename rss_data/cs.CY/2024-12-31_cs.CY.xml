      <title>AI-driven Automation as a Pre-condition for Eudaimonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The debate surrounding the 'future of work' is saturated with alarmist warnings about the loss of work as an intrinsically valuable activity. Instead, the present doctoral research approaches this debate from the perspective of human flourishing (eudaimonia). It articulates a neo-Aristotelian interpretation according to which the prospect of mass AI-driven automation, far from being a threat, is rather desirable insofar as it facilitates humans' flourishing and, subsequently, their engagement in leisure. Drawing on virtue jurisprudence, this research further explores what this desirability may imply for the current legal order.</description>

      <title>BikeNodePlanner: a data-driven decision support tool for bicycle node network planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bicycle node network is a wayfinding system targeted at recreational cyclists, consisting of numbered signposts placed alongside already existing infrastructure. Bicycle node networks are becoming increasingly popular as they encourage sustainable tourism and rural cycling, while also being flexible and cost-effective to implement. However, the lack of a formalized methodology and data-driven tools for the planning of such networks is a hindrance to their adaptation on a larger scale. To address this need, we present the BikeNodePlanner: a fully open-source decision support tool, consisting of modular Python scripts to be run in the free and open-source geographic information system QGIS. The BikeNodePlanner allows the user to evaluate and compare bicycle node network plans through a wide range of metrics, such as land use, proximity to points of interest, and elevation across the network. The BikeNodePlanner provides data-driven decision support for bicycle node network planning, and can hence be of great use for regional planning, cycling tourism, and the promotion of rural cycling.</description>

      <title>Left-handed representation in top 100 male professional tennis players: Multi-disciplinary perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commonly held opinion is that left-handed tennis players are overrepresented compared to the percentage of left-handers within the general population. This study provides the domain insights supported by data analysis that could help inform the decision of parents and coaches considering whether a child should start playing tennis as left- or right-handed when there is no strong arm-handed dominance. Compared to the commonly cited figure of about 10% of left-handed male population, data analysis from the official ATP web site for the top 100 ranked tennis players over the past decades (1985-2016) shows evidence of overrepresentation of left-handed elite tennis players (about 15%). The insights and data analysis can inform the handedness decision, advance coaching and strategic game concepts, enhance media coverage/analytics, left-handed facts and statistics, and inform tennis equipment manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Regulating radiology AI medical devices that evolve in their lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over time, the distribution of medical image data drifts due to multiple factors, including shifts in patient demographics, acquisition devices, and disease manifestation. While human radiologists can extrapolate their knowledge to such changes, AI systems cannot. In fact, deep learning models are highly susceptible to even slight variations in image characteristics. Therefore, manufacturers must update their models with new data to ensure that they remain safe and effective. Until recently, conducting such model updates in the USA and European Union meant applying for re-approval. Given the time and monetary costs associated with these processes, updates were infrequent, and obsolete systems continued functioning for too long. During 2024, several developments in the regulatory frameworks of these regions have taken place that promise to streamline the process of rolling out model updates safely: The European Artificial Intelligence Act came into effect last August, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the final marketing submission recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP) in December. We give an overview of the requirements and objectives of recent regulatory efforts and summarize the building blocks needed for successfully deploying dynamic systems. At the center of these pieces of regulation - and as prerequisites for manufacturers to conduct model updates without re-approval - are the need to describe the data collection and re-training processes and to establish real-world quality monitoring mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulating Agent-Based City Migration Using Conway's Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become a cornerstone of complexity science, enabling the study of heterogeneous agents interacting within dynamic environments. Among ABM frameworks, John Conway's Game of Life (GoL) stands out for its simplicity and ability to generate emergent macroscopic patterns from basic microscopic rules. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel GoL-based framework to simulate urban migration dynamics. Using a grid-within-a-grid approach, our approach encodes probabilistic tendencies for out-migration due to densification and sparsification, simulating the evolution of population centers. By initializing GoL grids with different distributions and parameterizing migration preferences, we explore how urban structures emerge and stabilize over time. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that even with simple rules, this framework shows promise for understanding emergent urban phenomena, providing insights into city growth and structure. Methodologically, our framework offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying urban migration patterns, contributing to the broader application of ABMs in computational urban social science.</description>

      <title>Overview of the development of smart classrooms under information technology: development and innovation of hardware and software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT), smart classroom has become an important trend in education modernization. This article reviews the development of smart classrooms from the hardware and software levels. The hardware describes the transformation from the construction of basic ICT facilities in single mode to a multi-modal information cloud platform. In terms of software, we look at the evolution of related supporting algorithms and technologies from the platform construction technology to the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology from the perspectives of learning analysis and data mining. Provide guidance and suggestions for future educators, researchers and policymakers on the future direction of smart classrooms.</description>

      <title>Does the Doer Effect Exist Beyond WEIRD Populations? Toward Analytics in Radio and Phone-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doer Effect states that completing more active learning activities, like practice questions, is more strongly related to positive learning outcomes than passive learning activities, like reading, watching, or listening to course materials. Although broad, most evidence has emerged from practice with tutoring systems in Western, Industrialized, Rich, Educated, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations in North America and Europe. Does the Doer Effect generalize beyond WEIRD populations, where learners may practice in remote locales through different technologies? Through learning analytics, we provide evidence from N = 234 Ugandan students answering multiple-choice questions via phones and listening to lectures via community radio. Our findings support the hypothesis that active learning is more associated with learning outcomes than passive learning. We find this relationship is weaker for learners with higher prior educational attainment. Our findings motivate further study of the Doer Effect in diverse populations. We offer considerations for future research in designing and evaluating contextually relevant active and passive learning opportunities including leveraging familiar technology, increasing the number of practice opportunities, and aligning multiple data sources.</description>

      <title>Rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI, generative AI) has rapidly become available as a tool in scientific research. To explore the use of generative AI in science, we conduct an empirical analysis using OpenAlex. Analyzing GenAI publications and other AI publications from 2017 to 2023, we profile growth patterns, the diffusion of GenAI publications across fields of study, and the geographical spread of scientific research on generative AI. We also investigate team size and international collaborations to explore whether GenAI, as an emerging scientific research area, shows different collaboration patterns compared to other AI technologies. The results indicate that generative AI has experienced rapid growth and increasing presence in scientific publications. The use of GenAI now extends beyond computer science to other scientific research domains. Over the study period, U.S. researchers contributed nearly two-fifths of global GenAI publications. The U.S. is followed by China, with several small and medium-sized advanced economies demonstrating relatively high levels of GenAI deployment in their research publications. Although scientific research overall is becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, our results suggest that GenAI research groups tend to have slightly smaller team sizes than found in other AI fields. Furthermore, notwithstanding recent geopolitical tensions, GenAI research continues to exhibit levels of international collaboration comparable to other AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Employment in Bangladesh: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is transforming industries and economies worldwide, presenting both opportunities and challenges for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and employment. This study qualitatively explores the impact of 4IR on the SME sector in Bangladesh. Initially, secondary data sources are reviewed to establish the context and to prepare the questionnaire for primary data collection. Then, the primary data is collected through Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions with different stakeholders including SME owners, association representatives, and government officials. The study reveals that while most of the participants have only a superficially awareness of 4IR, they view it as a blessing for the SME sector. Despite being in early adoption stages in Bangladesh, SMEs anticipate numerous benefits including enhanced customer experiences, reduced production times, improved quality, etc. Regarding employment, most participants believe that adopting 4IR in the SME sector of Bangladesh will create new job opportunities. However, participants express concern about challenges during the transition to 4IR, including a lack of technical knowledge, financial constraints, inadequate training, safety and security issues, etc. To fully harness 4IR's potential benefits for SMEs in Bangladesh, several key recommendations emerge that include analyzing of the current SME landscape, establishing a collaborative information sharing platform, organizing effective training and workshops, promoting resource sharing, encouraging local innovation, attracting foreign clients, ensuring proper policy implementation and fostering collaboration among government, associations, and academia. By addressing these challenges and implementing the recommended strategies, Bangladesh can effectively embrace the transformative benefits of 4IR, simultaneously improving its SME sector.</description>

      <title>The Patterns of Digital Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current consumer-protection debates focus on the powerful new data-analysis techniques that have disrupted the balance of power between companies and their customers. Online tracking enables sellers to amass troves of historical data, apply machine-learning tools to construct detailed customer profiles, and target those customers with tailored offers that best suit their interests. It is often a win-win. Sellers avoid pumping dud products and consumers see ads for things they actually want to buy. But the same tools are also used for ill -- to target vulnerable members of the population with scams specially tailored to prey on their weaknesses. The result has been a dramatic rise in online fraud that disproportionately impacts those least able to bear the loss.
  The law's response has been technology centric. Lawmakers race to identify those technologies that drive consumer deception and target them for regulatory restrictions. But that approach comes at a major cost. General-purpose data-analysis and communications tools have both desirable and undesirable uses, and uniform restrictions on their use impede the good along with the bad. A superior approach would focus not on the technological tools of deception but on what this Article identifies as the legal patterns of digital deception -- those aspects of digital technology that have outflanked the law's existing mechanisms for redressing consumer harm. This Article reorients the discussion from the power of new technologies to the shortcomings in existing regulatory structures that have allowed for their abuse. Focus on these patterns of deception will allow regulators to reallocate resources to offset those shortcomings and thereby enhance efforts to combat online fraud without impeding technological innovation.</description>

      <title>Will you donate money to a chatbot? The effect of chatbot anthropomorphic features and persuasion strategies on willingness to donate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the causal mechanism behind the effect of chatbot personification and persuasion strategies on users' perceptions and donation likelihood. In a 2 (personified vs. non-personified chatbot) x 2 (emotional vs. logical persuasion strategy) between-subjects experiment (N=76), participants engaged with a chatbot that represented a non-profit charitable organization. The results suggest that interaction with a personified chatbot evokes perceived anthropomorphism; however, it does not elicit greater willingness to donate. In fact, we found that commonly used anthropomorphic features, like name and narrative, led to negative attitudes toward an AI agent in the donation context. Our results showcase a preference for non-personified chatbots paired with logical persuasion appeal, emphasizing the significance of consistency in chatbot interaction, mirroring human-human engagement. We discuss the importance of moving from exploring the common scenario of a chatbot with machine identity vs. a chatbot with human identity in light of the recent regulations of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While homophily -- the tendency to link with similar others -- may nurture a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network. We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.</description>

      <title>Cool, But What About Oracles? An Oracle-Based Perspective on Blockchain Integration in the Accounting Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Reliable Legal AI: Combining Specialized Expert Systems and Adaptive Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal profession, focusing on its potential to streamline tasks such as document review, research, and contract drafting. However, challenges persist, particularly the occurrence of "hallucinations" in AI models, where they generate inaccurate or misleading information, undermining their reliability in legal contexts. To address this, the article proposes a novel framework combining a mixture of expert systems with a knowledge-based architecture to improve the precision and contextual relevance of AI-driven legal services. This framework utilizes specialized modules, each focusing on specific legal areas, and incorporates structured operational guidelines to enhance decision-making. Additionally, it leverages advanced AI techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KG), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve the system's accuracy. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing AI models, showcasing enhanced performance in legal tasks and offering a scalable solution to provide more accessible and affordable legal services. The article also outlines the methodology, system architecture, and promising directions for future research in AI applications for the legal sector.</description>

      <title>SAFE-MEME: Structured Reasoning Framework for Robust Hate Speech Detection in Memes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20541</link>

Abstract: Memes act as cryptic tools for sharing sensitive ideas, often requiring contextual knowledge to interpret. This makes moderating multimodal memes challenging, as existing works either lack high-quality datasets on nuanced hate categories or rely on low-quality social media visuals. Here, we curate two novel multimodal hate speech datasets, MHS and MHS-Con, that capture fine-grained hateful abstractions in regular and confounding scenarios, respectively. We benchmark these datasets against several competing baselines. Furthermore, we introduce SAFE-MEME (Structured reAsoning FramEwork), a novel multimodal Chain-of-Thought-based framework employing Q&amp;A-style reasoning (SAFE-MEME-QA) and hierarchical categorization (SAFE-MEME-H) to enable robust hate speech detection in memes. SAFE-MEME-QA outperforms existing baselines, achieving an average improvement of approximately 5% and 4% on MHS and MHS-Con, respectively. In comparison, SAFE-MEME-H achieves an average improvement of 6% in MHS while outperforming only multimodal baselines in MHS-Con. We show that fine-tuning a single-layer adapter within SAFE-MEME-H outperforms fully fine-tuned models in regular fine-grained hateful meme detection. However, the fully fine-tuning approach with a Q&amp;A setup is more effective for handling confounding cases. We also systematically examine the error cases, offering valuable insights into the robustness and limitations of the proposed structured reasoning framework for analyzing hateful memes.</description>

      <title>Towards nation-wide analytical healthcare infrastructures: A privacy-preserving augmented knee rehabilitation case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute towards the near-future privacy-preserving big data analytical healthcare platforms, capable of processing streamed or uploaded timeseries data or videos from patients. The experimental work includes a real-life knee rehabilitation video dataset capturing a set of exercises from simple and personalised to more general and challenging movements aimed for returning to sport. To convert video from mobile into privacy-preserving diagnostic timeseries data, we employed Google MediaPipe pose estimation. The developed proof-of-concept algorithms can augment knee exercise videos by overlaying the patient with stick figure elements while updating generated timeseries plot with knee angle estimation streamed as CSV file format. For patients and physiotherapists, video with side-to-side timeseries visually indicating potential issues such as excessive knee flexion or unstable knee movements or stick figure overlay errors is possible by setting a-priori knee-angle parameters. To address adherence to rehabilitation programme and quantify exercise sets and repetitions, our adaptive algorithm can correctly identify (91.67%-100%) of all exercises from side- and front-view videos. Transparent algorithm design for adaptive visual analysis of various knee exercise patterns contributes towards the interpretable AI and will inform near-future privacy-preserving, non-vendor locking, open-source developments for both end-user computing devices and as on-premises non-proprietary cloud platforms that can be deployed within the national healthcare system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning through Quantum Teleportation Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. However, the exchange of model updates can still expose sensitive information. Quantum teleportation, a process that transfers quantum states between distant locations without physical transmission of the particles themselves, has recently been implemented in real-world networks. This position paper explores the potential of integrating quantum teleportation into federated learning frameworks to bolster privacy. By leveraging quantum entanglement and the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation ensures that data remains secure during transmission, as any eavesdropping attempt would be detectable. We propose a novel architecture where quantum teleportation facilitates the secure exchange of model parameters and gradients among clients and servers. This integration aims to mitigate risks associated with data leakage and adversarial attacks inherent in classical federated learning setups. We also discuss the practical challenges of implementing such a system, including the current limitations of quantum network infrastructure and the need for hybrid quantum-classical protocols. Our analysis suggests that, despite these challenges, the convergence of quantum communication technologies and federated learning presents a promising avenue for achieving unprecedented levels of privacy in distributed machine learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Discrimination Testing for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models present new challenges in regulating against discriminatory behavior. In this paper, we argue that GenAI fairness research still has not met these challenges; instead, a significant gap remains between existing bias assessment methods and regulatory goals. This leads to ineffective regulation that can allow deployment of reportedly fair, yet actually discriminatory, GenAI systems. Towards remedying this problem, we connect the legal and technical literature around GenAI bias evaluation and identify areas of misalignment. Through four case studies, we demonstrate how this misalignment between fairness testing techniques and regulatory goals can result in discriminatory outcomes in real-world deployments, especially in adaptive or complex environments. We offer practical recommendations for improving discrimination testing to better align with regulatory goals and enhance the reliability of fairness assessments in future deployments.</description>

      <title>Can Telematics Improve Driving Style? The Use of Behavioural Data in Motor Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor insurance can use telematics data not only to understand the individual driving style, but also to implement innovative coaching strategies that feed back to the drivers, through an app, the aggregated information extracted from the data. The purpose is to encourage an improvement in their driving style. Precondition for this improvement is that drivers are digitally engaged, that is, they interact with the app. Our hypothesis is that the effectiveness of current experimentations depends on the integration of two distinct types of behavioural data: behavioural data on driving style and behavioural data on users' interaction with the app. Based on the empirical investigation of the dataset of a company selling a telematics motor insurance policy, our research shows that there is a correlation between engagement with the app and improvement of driving style, but the analysis must distinguish different groups of users with different driving abilities, and take into account time differences. Our findings contribute to clarify the methodological challenges that must be addressed when exploring engagement and coaching effectiveness in proactive insurance policies. We conclude by discussing the possibility and difficulties of tracking and using second-order behavioural data related to policyholder engagement with the app.</description>

      <title>How do machines learn? Evaluating the AIcon2abs method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is an expansion of a previous work aiming to evaluate the AIcon2abs method (AI from Concrete to Abstract: Demystifying Artificial Intelligence to the general public), an innovative method aimed at increasing the public (including children) understanding of machine learning (ML). The approach employs the WiSARD algorithm, a weightless neural network known for its simplicity, and user accessibility. WiSARD does not require Internet, making it ideal for non-technical users and resource-limited environments. This method enables participants to intuitively visualize and interact with ML processes through engaging, hands-on activities, as if they were the algorithms themselves. The method allows users to intuitively visualize and understand the internal processes of training and classification through practical activities. Once WiSARDs functionality does not require an Internet connection, it can learn effectively from a minimal dataset, even from a single example. This feature enables users to observe how the machine improves its accuracy incrementally as it receives more data. Moreover, WiSARD generates mental images representing what it has learned, highlighting essential features of the classified data. AIcon2abs was tested through a six-hour remote course with 34 Brazilian participants, including 5 children, 5 adolescents, and 24 adults. Data analysis was conducted from two perspectives: a mixed-method pre-experiment (including hypothesis testing), and a qualitative phenomenological analysis. Nearly all participants rated AIcon2abs positively, with the results demonstrating a high degree of satisfaction in achieving the intended outcomes. This research was approved by the CEP-HUCFF-UFRJ Research Ethics Committee.</description>

      <title>Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.</description>

      <title>Applying Predictive Analytics to Occupational Health and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive analytics is revolutionizing occupational health and safety (OHS). It offers evidence-based insights. These insights enable proactive risk management and informed, data-driven decision-making in organizational settings. This article explores the key components of predictive analytics in OHS, beginning with data collection, management, and preparation, and moving through to advanced predictive modelling techniques. We emphasize the importance of data integrity through processes such as missing value imputation, anomaly detection, and feature engineering to ensure accurate model predictions. Risk prioritization identifies and ranks hazards across various factors, including employee behaviours, organizational policies, environmental conditions, and operational practices. We posit that insights derived from predictive models must be effectively interpreted and implemented. These insights guide organizations to focus on high-impact areas for accident prevention and resource optimization. The integration of predictive analytics in OHS brings notable benefits, including enhanced decision-making, greater operational efficiency, cost savings, and improved compliance with safety standards. We examine applications of predictive analytics in OHS in Indian settings. We opine that, using predictive analytics, India can develop high safety standards while traversing the complexities of its workforce settings.</description>

      <title>General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</description>
