      <title>Anisotropy in a wire medium resulting from the rectangularity of a unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study is focused on the dispersion properties of a wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel wires at the frequencies close to its plasma frequency. While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal noticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice rectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires respectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the smallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation theory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the plasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect vanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM waves in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This provides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work I have shown that Herglotz actions reproduce the dynamics of classical mechanical theories which exhibit dynamical similarities. Recent work has shown how to extend field theories in both the Lagrangian and de Donder-Weyl formalism to contact geometry. In this article I show how dynamical similarity applies in field theory. This is applied in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, producing the contact equivalents. The result can be applied to general relativity where I demonstrate how to construct a complete description of the dynamics, equivalent to those derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action, without reference to the conformal factor.</description>

      <title>An explicit solution to the spinning ring problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ring may be regarded as a torus with r &lt;&lt; R, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. When such a ring is placed on a rough rod and released with some angular velocity, it may continue to vertically spin around the rod for some time instead of falling down immediately. It was observed that two different kinds of motion for the rod exist, which are referred to as single point and double point contact motion, based on the number of contact points of the ring that are in contact with the rod. Single point contact motion was observed for rings and double point contact motion was observed in the case of a washer. We investigated the characteristics of the single point contact motion. An explanation is provided for the single point contact motion of the ring and an analysis of the forces on the ring is made. We observe a hyperbolic decay in the angular velocity of the ring. An explicit solution is determined for the single point contact motion of the ring and the obtained solutions match the observed motion of the ring.</description>

      <title>Representation of continuum equations in physical components for arbitrary curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum equations are ubiquitous in physical modelling of elastic, viscous, and viscoelastic systems. The equations of continuum mechanics take nontrivial forms on curved surfaces. Although the curved surface formulation of the continuum equations are derived in many excellent references available in the literature, they are not readily usable for solving physical problems due to the covariant, contravariant or mixed nature of the stress and strain tensors in the equations. We present the continuum equations in terms of physical components in a general differentiable manifold. This general formulation of the continuum equations can be used readily for modelling physical problems on arbitrary curved surfaces. We demonstrate this with the help of some examples.</description>

      <title>Fourier's law breakdown for the planar-rotor chain with long-range coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, of a homogeneous chain of generically-ranged interacting planar rotors, more precisely the inertial $\alpha-XY$ model, is numerically studied with the coupling constant decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$. The conductance ($\sigma\equiv \kappa/L$) is calculated for typical values of $\alpha$, temperature $T$ and lattice size $L$. For large $L$, the results can be collapsed into an universal $q$-stretched exponential form, namely $L^{\delta_{\alpha}} \sigma \propto e_{q_{\alpha}}^{-B_{\alpha}(L^{\gamma_{\alpha}}T)^{\eta_{\alpha}}}$, where $e_q^z\equiv [1+ (1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$. The parameters $(\gamma_{\alpha},\delta_{\alpha},B_{\alpha}, \eta_{\alpha})$ are $\alpha$-dependent, and $q_{\alpha}$ is the index of the $q$-stretched exponential. This form is achievable due to the ratio $\eta_{\alpha}/(q-1)$ being almost constant with respect to the lattice size $L$. Two distinct regimes are identified: for $0 \le \alpha &lt; 2$, the Fourier law is violated, whereas for $\alpha\ge 2$, it is satisfied. These findings provide significant insights into heat conduction mechanisms in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Deriving friction force using fractional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The friction force is derived using fractional calculus by considering the non-uniform flow of time in dissipative processes. The approach incorporates inhomogeneous velocity without unphysical approximations, resulting in a Lagrangian where the order of fractional derivatives measures time intervals. The fractional term in the Lagrangian provides correct Euler-Lagrange, and ultimately, the Hamilton equations, and vanishes during energy change measurements, like a ghost.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Bound States in the Continuum in Coupled Helmholtz Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant states underlie a variety of metastructures that exhibit remarkable capabilities for effective control of acoustic waves at subwavelength scales. The development of metamaterials relies on the rigorous mode engineering providing the implementation of the desired properties. At the same time, the application of metamaterials is still limited as their building blocks are frequently characterized by complicated geometry and can't be tuned easily. In this work, we consider a simple system of coupled Helmholtz resonators and study their properties associated with the tuning of coupling strength and symmetry breaking. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum in the resonators placed in a free space and in a rectangular cavity. It is also shown that tuning the intrinsic losses via introducing porous inserts can lead to spectral splitting or merging of quasi-\textit{bound states in the continuum} and occurrence of \textit{exceptional points}. The obtained results will open new opportunities for the development of simple and easy-tunable metastructures based on Helmholtz resonances.</description>
