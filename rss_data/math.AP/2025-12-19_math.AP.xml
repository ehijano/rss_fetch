      <title>Fokas-type closed-form solution formulae for Sobolev-type equations with time-dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive novel explicit integral representations for the solution of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems for a large category of evolution partial differential equations of Sobolev-Galpern type with generic temporally variable coefficients, satisfying suitable mild conditions, and with arbitrary data in classical function spaces. This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Properties and Embedding Results in a Novel $(\Phi_x, \psi)$-Fractional Musielak Space with an Application to Nonlocal BVP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study a novel class of generalized $(\Phi_x,\psi)$-fractional Musielak spaces $\mathcal{K}_{\Phi_x}^{\alpha, \beta, \psi}$, which extends classical fractional spaces and offers the flexibility to model heterogeneous and nonlinear phenomena with memory and nonlocal effects. A detailed and rigorous analysis of their functional structure is carried out. Several new properties and embedding results are established, highlighting the originality of the proposed framework and its relevance to nonlocal BVPs. To illustrate the significance of this functional setting, we prove the existence of nontrivial solutions to a nonlinear fractional differential problem under an Ambrosetti--Rabinowitz type condition, using the mountain pass theorem. Our results provide new perspectives for the analysis of nonlocal and nonhomogeneous equations in variable-exponent and Musielak-Orlicz settings.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analysis for $(\theta,T)$-periodic functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Fourier analysis for a generalization of the class of periodic functions, often referred to as $(\theta, T)$-periodic functions, and prove several properties and inequalities related to the Fourier transform, including a type of Poincar\'e inequality, which extend the periodic case. As an application, we employ this analysis to show that a continuous linear operator acting on smooth $(\theta, T)$-periodic functions is globally hypoelliptic/solvable if and only if the corresponding operator which acts on periodic functions is globally hypoelliptic/solvable, and characterize the global hypoellipticity/solvability of a class of first order differential operators acting on the set of smooth $(\theta, T)$-periodic functions.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Formula for the Wave Propagator on Schwarzschild-de Sitter Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Poisson formula for the wave propagator of the Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) metric. That is done by proving a Poisson formula relating wave propagators and scattering resonances for a class of non-compactly supported potentials on the real line. That class includes the Regge--Wheeler potentials obtained from separation of variables for SdS. The novelty lies in allowing non-compact supports -- all exact Poisson formulae of Lax--Phillips, Melrose, and other authors required compactness of the support of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity Well-Posedness of Cauchy Problem for Two-Dimensional Relativistic Euler Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional relativistic Euler equations in a low-regularity setting. By introducing good variables--a rescaled velocity, logarithmic enthalpy, and an appropriately defined vorticity, we reformulate the equations into a coupled wave-transport system.
  First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions when the initial logarithmic enthalpy $h_0$, rescaled velocity $\bv_0$, and vorticity $\bw_0$ satisfy $(h_0, \bv_0, \bw_0, \nabla \bw_0) \in H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac32+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times L^8(\mathbb{R}^2)$. By using Strichartz estimates and semiclassical analysis, a relaxed well-posedness result holds when $(h_0, \bv_0, \bw_0, \nabla \bw_0) \in H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac32}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times L^8(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Both results are valid for the general state function $p(\varrho)=\varrho^A$ ($A \geq 1$).
  Secondly, in the special case where $p(\varrho)=\varrho$, the acoustic metric reduces to the standard flat Minkowski metric. We can establish the well-posedness of solutions when $(h_0, \mathbf{v}_0, \mathbf{w}_0) \in H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac{7}{4}+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{1+}(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The regularity exponents for the log-enthalpy and rescaled velocity correspond to those in Smith and Tataru \cite{ST}, while the vorticity regularity corresponds to Bourgain and Li \cite{BL}. Moreover, if the stiff flow is irrotational, we can prove the local well-posedness for $(h_0, \mathbf{v}_0) \in H^{1+}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, and global well-posedness for small initial data $(h_0, \bv_0) \in \dot{B}^{1}_{2,1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions of 3D compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations subject to large external potential forces with discontinuous initial data and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations subject to large external potential forces with discontinuous initial data in a three-dimensional bounded domain under Navier-slip boundary conditions. We show the global existence of weak solutions for such an initial-boundary value problem provided the initial energy is suitably small. In particular, the initial data may contain vacuum states and possibly exhibit large oscillations. To overcome difficulties brought by boundary and large external forces, some new estimates based on the effective viscous flux play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Low Regularity Solutions to the g-SQG Equation with Regular Level Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the generalized SQG equation on the plane is locally well-posed in spaces of low regularity solutions (essentially H\"older continuous with H\"older exponents depending on the equation parameter $\alpha\in(0,\frac 12)$) that have $H^2$ level sets (i.e., with $L^2$ curvatures). Moreover, for $\alpha\le\frac 16$ and initial data satisfying some additional hypotheses we show that the corresponding solutions can stop existing only when their level sets lose $H^2$-regularity, and hence not just due to level set collisions or "pile ups".</description>

      <title>On the existence of full dimensional KAM tori for 1D periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will prove the existence of full dimensional tori for 1-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{eqnarray}\label{maineq0} \mathbf{i}u_{t}-u_{xx}+V*u+\epsilon f(x)|u|^{4}u=0,\ x\in\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}, \end{eqnarray} with boundary conditions, where $V*$ is the Fourier multiplier, and $f(x)$ is Gevrey smooth. Here the radius of the invariant tori satisfies a slower decay, i.e. \[ I_n\sim e^{-2\ln^{\sigma}|n|}, \mbox{as}\ n\rightarrow\infty, \] for any $ \sigma&gt; 2, $ which extends results of Bourgain \cite{BJFA2005} and Cong \cite{cong2024} to the case that the nonlinear perturbation depends explicitly on the space variable $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the low-Mach-number limit for solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes or Euler equations for different types of fluids. We first review the different results obtained in the case of flows consisting of one phase. Then, we focus on the low-Mach-number limit for two-phase flows, considering different types of systems: with an algebraic closure or a PDE closure for the pressure, with one single or two different velocities, without or with entropy.</description>

      <title>Nekhoroshev type stability for non-local semilinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nekhoroshev-type stability for solutions of ultra-differentiable regularity in Schr\"odinger equations with non-local nonlinear terms, employing the method of rational normal forms. We establish the first rigorous results for logarithmic ultra-differentiable regularity in infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems without external parameters. Under Gevrey class regularity assumptions, we achieve the stability times matching Bourgain's conjectured optimal stability time in \cite{B04}. Furthermore, we introduce a novel global vector field norm adapted to the rational normal form framework. This norm eliminate the need for degree tracking during the iteration process, thereby enabling a unified treatment of nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>A unified proof of sharp bounds for the Jacobi heat kernel with trace and estimates of multiplicative constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a unified and optimized proof of the sharp bounds for the Jacobi heat kernel, which were obtained gradually in several papers in recent years. We lay particular emphasis on tracing and estimating all constants appearing throughout the entire reasoning. This allows us to quantitatively control the multiplicative constants in the Jacobi heat kernel bounds in terms of the parameters involved. Consequently, analogous control extends to a number of interrelated heat kernels. In particular, we obtain quantitative control in terms of the associated dimension for the spherical heat kernel and for all other heat kernels on compact rank one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Bifurcating domains for an overdetermined eigenvalue problem in cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an overdetermined eigenvalue problem for domains $\Omega$ contained in the half-cylinder $\Sigma=\omega \times (0, +\infty)$, based on a bounded regular domain $\omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$. It is easy to see that in any bounded cylinder $\Omega_{t}=\omega \times (0, t)$, $t &gt; 0$, the eigenvalue problem admits a one-dimensional positive eigenfunction which satisfies the overdetermined boundary conditions. The aim of the paper is to construct other domains $\Omega\subset \Sigma$ for which there exists a positive eigenfunction that is a solution of the overdetermined problem. This is achieved by showing that branches of such domains bifurcate from the ``trivial'' domains $\Omega_{t_j}$ at the values $t_{j} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{\sigma_j}}$ where $\sigma_j$ ($j\geq 1$) is a simple Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on $\omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$. The solutions can be reflected with respect to $\omega$ to generate nontrivial solutions in a cylinder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper combines the decay of high modes with the smallness introduced by high orders, leading to a normal form lemma for infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems under ultra-differentiable regularity. We prove the sub-exponential stability time of a wide class of Hamiltonian PDEs, including the Schr\"odinger equation with convolution potentials, fractional-order Schr\"odinger equations, and beam equations with metrics. When the conditions are equivalent to previous ones, the stability time we obtain reaches Bourgain's predicted optimal bound. Furthermore, we approach earlier results under lower conditions. These results are discussed within a general framework we propose, which applies to the ultra-differential class.</description>

Abstract: In a recent interesting work [15], W.Y. He established the important partial regularity theory and the almost optimal higher regularity theory for energy minimizing harmonic almost complex structures. Based on a new observation on the structure of equations, we give an easier new proof of the partial regularity theorem, and adapting the powerful quantitative stratification method of Naber-Valtorta [22], we further prove the rectifiability of singular stratum of energy minimizing harmonic almost complex structures. Based on this, we establish an optimal regularity theory, which improves the corresponding result of He.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a micropolar fluid flow in a media perforated by periodically distributed obstacles of size $\varepsilon$. A non-homogeneous boundary condition for microrotation is considered: the microrotation is assumed to be proportional to the rotation rate of the velocity on the boundary of the obstacles. The existence and uniqueness of solution is analyzed. Moreover, passing to the limit when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, an analogue of the classical micropolar Darcy law in the theory of porous media is derived.</description>

      <title>Uniform vanishing damping limit for the 2D inviscid Oldroyd-B model with fractional stress tensor diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the uniform vanishing damping limit of the 2D inviscid Oldroyd-B model with fractional stress tensor diffusion. Firstly, we find that fractional stress tensor diffusion helps to reduce the global regularity of the 2D Oldroyd-B model with damping coefficient $a\in[0,1]$. By virtue of improved Fourier splitting method, we then prove the optimal time decay rates under the critical regularity for $a=0$. When $a\in (0,1]$, we establish time decay rates that are uniform with respect to $a$. Combining the time decay rate for $a\in [0,1]$ and the time integrability, we obtain the uniform damping vanishing rates for the 2D Oldroyd-B model. Using spectral analysis methods, we finally improve the time decay rates for $\mathrm{tr}\tau$ with $a\in (0,1]$, which ensure the sharp uniform damping vanishing rates of $\mathrm{tr}\tau$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following fractional Choquard equation with mixed nonlinearities:
  \[
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
  (-\Delta)^s u = \lambda u + \alpha \left( I_\mu * |u|^q \right) |u|^{q-2} u + \left( I_\mu * |u|^p \right) |u|^{p-2} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \\[4pt]
  \displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^2 \,\mathrm{d}x = c^2 &gt; 0.
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \]
  Here $N &gt; 2s$, $s \in (0,1)$, $\mu \in (0, N)$, and the exponents satisfy
  \[
  \frac{2N - \mu}{N} &lt; q &lt; p &lt; \frac{2N - \mu}{N - 2s},
  \]
  while $\alpha &gt; 0$ is a sufficiently small parameter, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the mass constraint, and $I_\mu$ denotes the Riesz potential. We establish existence and multiplicity results for normalized solutions and, in addition, prove the existence of ground state normalized solutions for $\alpha$ in a suitable range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for sufficiently small $H^3$-perturbations of an affine solution, the Cauchy problem for the compressible nonlinear elastodynamics in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d=2,3$, admits a unique global strong solution. Moreover, we establish the asymptotic behavior of the solution.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type Theorems for Stable Solutions of the H\'enon-Lane-Emden System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the H\'enon-Lane-Emden system defined by $- \Delta u=|x|^a |v|^{p-1}v$ and $- \Delta v=|x|^b |u|^{q-1}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^N \!\setminus\! \{0\}$. We begin by establishing a general Liouville-type theorem for the subcritical case. Then we prove that the H\'{e}non-Lane-Emden conjecture is valid for solutions stable outside a compact set, provided that $0 &lt; \min\,\{p, q\} &lt; 1$, or $0 \leq a - b \leq (N-2)(p - q)$, or $N \leq \frac{2(p+q+2)}{pq-1} + 10$. Additional Liouville-type theorems for the subcritical case are also obtained. Furthermore, we address the supercritical case. To our knowledge, these results constitute the first Liouville-type theorems for this class of solutions in the H\'{e}non-Lane-Emden system. As a by-product, several existing results in the literature are refined.</description>

      <title>Constructing steering-type solutions for higher order Cauchy-Riemann equations in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multidimensional Cauchy-Riemann operator provides a framework for studying higher order partial differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, whose solutions include polymonogenic and polyharmonic functions, among others. In this work, we aim to explicitly construct solutions to such systems, generated from families of complex valued functions which are closed under conjugation and under the action of the complex Cauchy-Riemann operator. Moreover, we prove that precisely some of these solutions also satisfy homogeneous linear differential equations involving the so-called hypercomplex derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an optimal global Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund type estimate for the viscosity solution to the Dirichlet boundary problem of fully nonlinear elliptic equations with possibly nonconvex nonlinearities. We prove that the Hessian of the solution is as integrable as the nonhomogeneous term in the setting of a given generalized Orlicz space even when the nonlinearity is asymptotically convex with respect to the Hessian of the solution.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a wave maps type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-time blowup for a nonlinear wave equation for maps from the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into the 1-sphere $\mathbb{S}^1$, whose nonlinearity exhibits a null-form structure. We construct, for every dimension $d \geq 1$, a countable family of discretely self-similar blowup solutions, which are even for $d=1$ and radial for $d \geq 2$. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation.</description>

      <title>The capillary Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a $k$-th capillary area measure for capillary convex bodies in the Euclidean half-space, which serves as a boundary counterpart to the classical concept of area measure (see, e.g., \cite[Chapter 8]{Sch}). We then propose a Christoffel-Minkowski problem for capillary convex bodies, to find a capillary convex body in the Euclidean half-space with a prescribed $k$-th capillary area measure. This problem is equivalent to solving a Hessian-type equation with a Robin boundary value condition. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution under a natural sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Unconditional uniqueness of Hardy--H\'enon parabolic equations on Herz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the unconditional uniqueness of solutions in Herz spaces for the Hardy--H\'enon parabolic equation, which is a semilinear heat equation with a power-type weight in the nonlinear term $|x|^\gamma|u|^{\alpha-1}u$. It is expected that the power-type weight in the nonlinear term can be effectively handled within Herz spaces. In fact, our result in Herz spaces $\dot{K}^s_{q,r}({\mathbb R}^n)$ relaxes the endpoint case $q=\alpha$ and the large interpolation exponent case $r\ge q$ compared to previous results.</description>

Abstract: We prove the stability under lamination of a set of real, symmetric 3$\times$3 matrices that can be viewed as a subset of the effective conductivities of a polycrystal. Constructed in a companion paper, such set in combination with several previous constructions provides the best inner bound known so far on the $G$-closure of a three dimensional polycrystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite of the fact that the Damped Wave and the Heat equations describe phenomena of distinct nature, it is amazing that their solutions are related in the limit as $t \to \infty$. The aim of this note is to explain to undergraduate students, with a good calculus background, how the relation between these solutions is established. We follow a ``do it yourself'' strategy and the students are invited to do the suggested exercises in order to understand the content of this note.</description>

      <title>Information theory and discriminative sampling for model discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a numerical framework for reconstructing the potential in two dimensional semilinear elliptic PDEs with power type nonlinearities from the nonlinear Dirichlet to Neumann map. By applying higher order linearization method, we compute the Fourier data of the unknown potential and then invert it to recover $q$. Numerical experiments show accurate reconstructions for both smooth and discontinuous test cases.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a minimizer $u$ in $ H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for the Hartree energy functional with convolution potential $w$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)+L^{3/2,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with $L^\infty$ part vanishing at infinity. This class includes sums of potentials of the kind $-\frac{1}{|x|^\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha\le2$, together with the case $w$ in $L^{3/2}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. We prove the existence of such groundstates for a wide range of $L^2$ masses. We also establish basic properties of the groundstates, i.e.~positivity and regularity. Lastly, we exploit the estimates we derived for the stationary problem to prove global well-posedness of the associated evolution problem and orbital stability of the set of ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that singular Riemannian foliations, or, more generally, manifold submetries, defined on a compact normal homogeneous space, have algebraic nature. Moreover, in this case there exists a one-to-one correspondence between algebras of algebraic functions preserved by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and manifold submetries.
  A key intermediate result is that, for any manifold submetry on a compact normal homogeneous space, the vector field given by the mean curvature of the fibers is basic, in the sense that it is related to a vector field in the base.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of micropolar fluid flows in a thin domain of thickness $\eta_\varepsilon$ with a periodic oscillating boundary with wavelength $\varepsilon$. We consider the limit when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and, depending on the limit of the ratio of $\eta_\varepsilon/\varepsilon$, we prove the existence of three different regimes. In each regime, we derive a generalized Reynolds equation taking into account the microstructure of the roughness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of operators and wave propagation in high-contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper aims to study the spectral properties of elliptic operators with highly inhomogeneous coefficients and related issues concerning wave propagation in high-contrast media. A unified approach to solving problems in bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, as well as in infinite periodic media, is proposed. For a small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ characterizing the contrast of the components of the medium, the analyticity of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is established in a neighborhood of $\varepsilon = 0$. Effective operators corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$ are described.</description>

      <title>Critical point localization and multiplicity results in Banach spaces via Nehari manifold technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, results on the existence of critical points in annular subsets of a cone are obtained with the additional goal of obtaining multiplicity results. Compared to other approaches in the literature based on the use of Krasnoselskii's compression-extension theorem or topological index methods, our approach uses the Nehari manifold technique in a surprising combination with the cone version of Birkhoff-Kellogg's invariant-direction theorem. This yields a simpler alternative to traditional methods involving deformation arguments or Ekeland variational principle. The new method is illustrated on a boundary value problem for p-Laplacian equations, and we believe that it will be useful for proving the existence, localization, and multiplicity of solutions for other classes of problems with variational structure.</description>

      <title>Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem under Magnetic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both the Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem when a family of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are given for an open set of magnetic/electromagnetic potentials. For the Riemannian version, by allowing small perturbations of the magnetic potential, we use the Runge Approximation Theorem to show that the metric can be uniquely determined. There is no gauge equivalence in this case. For the Lorentzian version, we use microlocal analysis to construct the trajectory of null-geodesics via generic perturbations of the electromagnetic potential, hence the conformal class of the metric can be constructed. Moreover, we also show, in the Lorentzian case, the same result can be obtained using generic perturbations of the metric itself.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized System with Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-time blowup of solutions $(u(x,t),b(x,t))$ to a generalized system of equations with applications to ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and one-dimensional fluid convection and stretching, among other areas, is investigated. The system is parameter-dependent, our spatial domain is the unit interval or the circle, and the initial data $(u_0(x),b_0(x))$ is assumed to be smooth. Among other results, we derive precise blowup criteria for specific values of the parameters by tracking the evolution of $u_x$ along Lagrangian trajectories that originate at a point $x_0$ at which $b_0(x)$ and $b_0'(x)$ vanish. We employ concavity arguments, energy estimates, and ODE comparison methods. We also show that for some values of the parameters, a non-vanishing $b_0'(x_0)$ suppresses finite-time blowup.</description>

      <title>On global classical and weak solutions with arbitrary large initial data to the multi-dimensional viscous Saint-Venant system and compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition under spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1871, Saint-Venant introduced the renowned shallow water equations. Since then, for the two-dimensional viscous or inviscid shallow water equations, the global existence of smooth solutions with arbitrarily large initial data has remained a challenging and long-standing open problem. In this paper, we provide an affirmative resolution to the viscous problem under the assumption of two-dimensional radial symmetry. Specifically, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions for the two-dimensional radially symmetric viscous shallow water equations with arbitrary smooth initial data. To achieve this goal, our approach relies crucially on overcoming two major obstacles: first, treating the viscous Saint-Venant system as the endpoint case of the BD entropy condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations; and second, addressing the critical embedding imposed by the spatial dimension, which currently holds only in two dimensions. However, the same result can be extended to three dimension for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying general BD entropy conditions excluding the endpoint case. Indeed, under the same symmtric framework, we also prove the global existence of smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data for both the two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition. It is particularly noteworthy that the aforementioned shallow water equations precisely correspond to the endpoint case of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy condition.</description>

      <title>A convergent finite difference-quadrature scheme for the porous medium equation with nonlocal pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a numerical approximation of the porous medium equation with fractional potential pressure introduced by Caffarelli and V\'azquez: \[ \partial_t u = \nabla \cdot (u^{m-1}\nabla (-\Delta)^{-\sigma}u) \qquad \text{for} \qquad m\geq2 \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma\in(0,1). \] Our scheme is for one space dimension and positive solutions $u$. It consists of solving numerically the equation satisfied by $v(x,t)=\int_{-\infty}^xu(x,t)dx$, the quasilinear non-divergence form equation \[ \partial_t v= -|\partial_x v|^{m-1} (- \Delta)^{s} v \qquad \text{where} \qquad s=1-\sigma, \] and then computing $u=v_x$ by numerical differentiation. Using upwinding ideas in a novel way, we construct a new and simple, monotone and $L^\infty$-stable, approximation for the $v$-equation, and show local uniform convergence to the unique discontinuous viscosity solution. Using ideas from probability theory, we then prove that the approximation of $u$ converges weakly-$*$, or more precisely, up to normalization, in $C(0,T; P(\mathbb{R}))$ where $P(\mathbb{R})$ is the space of probability measures under the Rubinstein-Kantorovich metric.The analysis include also fundamental solutions where the initial data for $u$ is a Dirac mass. Numerical tests are included to confirm the results. Our scheme seems to be the first numerical scheme for this type of problems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spaces for the bilateral shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of smooth solutions for the LYZ equation at the critical phase $\theta =(n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$, thereby solving the critical case of a problem posed by Collins-Jacob-Yau and Li concerning the solvability for phase $\theta \leq (n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$. As applications, we solve the 3D Hessian equation $\sigma_2 = 1$ and the 4D Hessian quotient equation $\sigma_3 = \sigma_1$ under weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new second-order fast finite difference scheme in time for solving the Tempered Time Fractional Advection-Dispersion Equation. Under the assumption that the solution is nonsmooth at the initial time, we investigate the uniqueness, stability, and convergence of the scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the scheme achieves second-order convergence in both time and space. Finally, corresponding numerical examples are provided.</description>
