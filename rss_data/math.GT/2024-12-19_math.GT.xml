      <title>Diagonal knots and the tau invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Ozsv\'ath, Szab\'o, and Rasmussen introduced the $\tau$ invariant for knots, and in 2011, Sarkar published a computational shortcut for the $\tau$ invariant of knots that can be represented by diagonal grid diagrams. Previously, the only knots known to have diagonal grid diagram representations were torus knots. We prove that all such knots are positive knots, and we produce an example of a knot with a diagonal grid diagram representation which is not a torus knot.</description>

      <title>Monodromy kernel for a stratum component of translation surfaces in genus 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present note, we complete the correspondence between stratum components of translation surfaces in low genus and finite-type Artin groups with defining Dynkin diagram containing $E_6$. In an earlier work, we showed that in genus $3$ the monodromy of the non-hyperelliptic connected components $\mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{odd}}(4)$ and $\mathcal{H}(3,1)$ are highly non-injective, as the respective kernels contain a non-abelian free group of rank $2$. The result holds since both the stratum components are orbifold classifying spaces for central extensions of the inner automorphism groups of the finite-type Artin groups $A_{E_6}$ and $A_{E_7}$, respectively. The following is a note extending the same result to the stratum $\mathcal{H}^{\operatorname{even}}(6)$ in genus $4$, which is an orbifold classifying space for a central extension of the group $\operatorname{Inn}(A_{E_8})$.</description>

      <title>Gyration Stability for Projective Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrations are operations on manifolds that arise in geometric topology, where a manifold $M$ may exhibit distinct gyrations depending on the chosen twisting. For a given $M$, we ask a natural question: do all gyrations of $M$ share the same homotopy type regardless of the twisting? A manifold with this property is said to have gyration stability. Inspired by recent work by Duan, which demonstrated that the quaternionic projective plane is not gyration stable with respect to diffeomorphism, we explore this question for projective planes in general. We obtain a complete description of gyration stability for the complex, quaternionic, and octonionic projective planes up to homotopy.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of CAT(0) groups, exotic finiteness properties and non-QI-embeddings into linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$ we construct an example of a subgroup $L&lt; G$ of a linear ${\rm CAT}(0)$ group $G$ such that $L$ is of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ and not $\mathcal{F}_n$, and $L$ does not admit a representation into $\mathsf{GL}_d(k)$ which is a quasi-isometric embedding for any local field $k$. We further prove that there is a faithful representation of $L$ into some $\mathsf{GL}_{\ell}(\mathbb{C})$ which is not the restriction of any representation of $G$. This generalises a family of fibre products of type $\mathcal{F}_2$ not $\mathcal{F}_3$ with these properties constructed by the second author.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of spaces of locally convex curves in the sphere S^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$. Let $L_n(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0) = z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$ for all $z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. As a corollary, we obtain the homotopy type of the space of closed locally convex curves in either $S^3$ or $P^3$.
  There are many previous papers addressing related questions. An early paper solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result (with B. Shapiro) reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where $Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group of order $16$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1 \in Quat_4 \smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx \Omega Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for $z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is equivalent to the wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$ with an infinite countable family of spheres (as for the case $n = 2$).
  The structure of the proof can be compared to that of the case $n = 2$ but some of the steps require the creation of new theories, involving algebra and combinatorics. We construct explicit subsets $Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$ for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For $n = 2$, there is a simple geometric description of $Y$; for $n = 3$, the far less natural construction is based on the theory of itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in $L_n(1;z_1)$ is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of nontrivial permutations.</description>

      <title>Cusp types of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining when a flat manifold can occur as a cusp cross-section within a given commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds of simplest type. This reduces the problem of identifying which commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds can contain a specific flat manifold as a cusp cross-section to a question involving rational representations of the flat manifold's holonomy group. As applications, we prove that a flat manifold $M$ with a holonomy group of odd order appears as a cusp cross-section in every commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds if and only if $b_1(M)\geq 3$. We also provide examples of flat manifolds that arise as cusp cross-sections in a unique commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds and exhibit examples of pairs of flat manifolds that can never appear as cusp cross-sections within the same commensurability class.</description>

      <title>Orbits by the up-down action of braid diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of all virtual or classical braid diagrams forms a monoid and gives a natural monoid action on a direct product of ${\mathbb Z}$. We call this action the up-down action. In this paper, we determine the orbit of any tuple of ${\mathbb Z}$ under the up-down action of virtual or classical braid diagrams. Moreover, we determine the orbit for irreducible braid diagrams. We also consider the isotropy submonoid and give a condition for a braid diagram to admit an up-down coloring to its closure.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>
