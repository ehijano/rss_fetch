      <title>An exploration of the curvature and inheritance properties of the Interior black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuation of the study in \cite{SDHK_interior_2020}, the present article explores the geometric and curvature properties of the interior black hole (briefly, IBH) spacetime. It is shown that in an IBH spacetime the operator $R\cdot C$ and $C\cdot R$ does not commute with each other and infact the commutator $C\cdot R-R\cdot C$ is linearly dependent with $Q(g,R)$ and $Q(S,R)$ as well as $Q(g,C)$ and $Q(S,C)$. Also in IBH spacetime $R \cdot R$ is linearly dependent with $Q(S,R)$ and $Q(g,C)$. It is exhibited that IBH spacetime is $2$-quasi Einstein, Ein$(2)$ and generalized quasi Einstein spacetime in the sense of Chaki, and its conformal $2$-forms are recurrent. We have derived the universal form of the compatible tensors in such a spacetime. We have also demonstrated that the nature of energy momentum tensor of IBH spacetime is pseudosymmetric (see, Theorem $4.1$). Again it is exposed that with respect to the non-Killing vector field $\frac{\partial}{\partial t},$ the IBH spacetime obeys the generalized curvature inheritance, generalized Ricci inheritance, special type of generalized conformal, concircular, conharmonic and generalized Weyl projective inheritance. Finally a comparison between IBH spacetime and KIselev Black Hole (KBH) is displayed.</description>

      <title>Physical Formalism Of Directional Quantum Evolution Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we introduce the Directional Quantum Evolution Theory (DQET), a covariant reformulation of quantum mechanics where evolution takes place along a four-vector-defined arbitrary timelike direction. This method restores space-time symmetry and provides a geometric interpretation of energy as a frame-dependent projection by substituting a directional derivative for the traditional time derivative. DQET establishes a conserved probability current, supports proper-time evolution, and recovers the Schrodinger in suitable bounds. It provides a covariant solution to the quantum twin conundrum and predicts observable phase discrepancies between systems traveling along distinct trajectories. With encouraging extensions to curved spacetime, the theory offers a cohesive framework for relativistic quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Isochronous islands in the two-harmonic standard map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isochronous islands are regular solutions related to different chains of elliptic points but with the same winding number. These isochronous islands emerge in phase space as a response to multiple resonant perturbations and can be simulated using a simple discrete model called the two-harmonic standard map. We observed three types of isochronous transitions, which can be formed through saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Why We Do Not Need Dark Energy to Explain Cosmological Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that at the present stage of the evolution of the universe, cosmological acceleration is an inevitable {\bf kinematical} consequence of quantum theory in semiclassical approximation. Quantum theory does not involve such classical concepts as Minkowski or de Sitter spaces. In classical theory, when choosing Minkowski space, a vacuum catastrophe occurs, while when choosing de Sitter space, the value of the cosmological constant can be arbitrary. On the contrary, in quantum theory there are no uncertainties in view of the following: 1) the de Sitter algebra is the most general ten-dimensional Lie algebra; 2) the Poincare algebra is a special degenerate case of the de Sitter algebra in the limit $R\to\infty$ where $R$ is the contraction parameter for the transition from the de Sitter to the Poincare algebra and $R$ has nothing to do with the radius of de Sitter space; 3) $R$ is fundamental to the same extent as $c$ and $\hbar$: $c$ is the contraction parameter for the transition from the Poincare to the Galilean algebra and $\hbar$ is the contraction parameter for the transition from quantum to classical theory; 4) as a consequence, the question (why the quantities $(c,\hbar,R$) have the values which they actually have) does not arise. The solution to the problem of cosmological acceleration follows from results on irreducible representations of the de Sitter algebra. This solution is free of uncertainties and does not involve dark energy, quintessence and other exotic mechanisms the physical meaning of which is a mystery.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of arbitrary single-copy quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is the problem of estimating a given quantum state. Usually, it is required to run the quantum experiment - state preparation, state evolution, measurement - several times to be able to estimate the output quantum state of the experiment, because an exponentially high number of copies of the state is required. In this work, we present an efficient algorithm to estimate with a small but non-zero probability of error the output state of the experiment using a single copy of the state, without knowing the evolution dynamics of the state. It also does not destroy the original state, which can be recovered easily for any further quantum processing. As an example, it is usually required to repeat a quantum image processing experiment many times, since many copies of the state of the output image are needed to extract the information from all its pixels. The information from $\mathcal{N}$ pixels of the image can be inferred from a single run of the image processing experiment in our algorithm, to efficiently estimate the density matrix of the image state.</description>

      <title>Near Stein-Weiss Vector Field Groups in Characteristic Nearness Approximation Spaces in the Complex Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces results for the characteristically near Stein-Weiss groups inherent in vector fields in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. Near groups are discerned in the context of characteristic nearness approximation spaces (cNASs). A characteristic of a Stein-Weiss group is a holomorphic mapping $\varphi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ defined by $\varphi(t)=e^{jt}$, which defines a vector field in the complex plane. All characteristic vectors emanate from the same fixed point in $\mathbb{C}$, namely, 0.</description>

      <title>Electron Wave-Spin Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a wave-entity perspective of the electron spin qubit, treating the electron as a continuous physical wave rather than a point-like particle. In this theoretical framework, each spin qubit corresponds to a distinct current density configuration, offering a resolution to the paradox of a particle appearing to spin both up and down simultaneously. We further predict the existence of a persistent, azimuthally asymmetric magnetic field associated with the wave-spin qubit, an effect not anticipated by the conventional particle-spin model. Notably, the qubit's relative phase governs the orientation of both the current and the magnetic field, suggesting a mechanism for direct, local interactions between qubits. This phase-dependent coupling could form the basis for inherently parallel quantum computing architectures, in contrast to the sequential operations of gate-based logic. While this framework is grounded in theoretical analysis, it yields testable predictions -- particularly regarding the magnetic field structure -- that invite experimental verification. By treating the electron wave as the fundamental physical entity, rather than a probabilistic abstraction, we explore the possibility of a quantum model that is deterministic, local, causal, and fully consistent with special relativity.</description>
