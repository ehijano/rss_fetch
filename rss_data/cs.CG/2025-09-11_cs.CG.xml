      <title>Swept Volume Computation with Enhanced Geometric Detail Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swept volume computation, the determination of regions occupied by moving objects, is essential in graphics, robotics, and manufacturing. Existing approaches either explicitly track surfaces, suffering from robustness issues under complex interactions, or employ implicit representations that trade off geometric fidelity and face optimization difficulties. We propose a novel inversion of motion perspective: rather than tracking object motion, we fix the object and trace spatial points backward in time, reducing complex trajectories to efficiently linearizable point motions. Based on this, we introduce a multi field tetrahedral framework that maintains multiple distance fileds per element, preserving fine geometric details at trajectory intersections where single field methods fail. Our method robustly computes swept volumes for diverse motions, including translations and screw motions, and enables practical applications in path planning and collision detection.</description>

      <title>Toward Precise Curve Offsetting Constrained to Parametric Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing offsets of curves on parametric surfaces is a fundamental yet challenging operation in computer aided design and manufacturing. Traditional analytical approaches suffer from time-consuming geodesic distance queries and complex self intersection handling, while discrete methods often struggle with precision. In this paper, we propose a totally different algorithm paradigm. Our key insight is that by representing the source curve as a sequence of line segment primitives, the Voronoi decomposition constrained to the parametric surface enables localized offset computation. Specifically, the offsetting process can be efficiently traced by independently visiting the corresponding Voronoi cells. To address the challenge of computing the Voronoi decomposition on parametric surfaces, we introduce two key techniques. First, we employ intrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic distances. Second, instead of directly computing the surface-constrained Voronoi decomposition, we decompose the triangulated parameter plane using a series of plane cutting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior accuracy and runtime performance compared to existing methods. We also present several practical applications enabled by our approach.</description>

      <title>Morphology-Preserving Remeshing Approach to Particulate Microstructures via Harmonic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain, thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their future applications.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Computing Integer Hulls of 2D Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\texttt{IntegerHull}$ function is part of Maple's $\texttt{PolyhedralSets}$ library, which calculates the integer hull of a given polyhedral set. This algorithm works by translating the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the input polyhedral set inwards till each hyperplane encounters at least one integer point. The polyhedral set is then divided into smaller regions and a brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.
  There are certain edge case scenarios where the computational cost of the existing algorithm can be high, for which we propose a new algorithm. We translate the supporting hyperplanes of the facets inwards from the (relative) opposite vertex till the hyperplanes encounter at least one integer point. Then, we can follow the same procedure as the old algorithm or use a recursive technique on the smaller regions.
  The edge case scenarios mentioned above occurs when there are integer points present on the supporting hyperplanes of the facets of the polyhedral set. This increases the region on which the brute force method is applied to find the remaining vertices.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the computed homology and cohomology bases -- technical report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing homology and cohomology is at the heart of many recent works and a key issue for topological data analysis. Among homological objects, homology generators are useful to locate or understand holes (especially for geometric objects). The present paper provides a characterization of the class of homology bases that are computed by standard algorithmic methods. The proof of this characterization relies on the Homological Discrete Vector Field, a combinatorial structure for computing homology, which encompasses several standard methods (persistent homology, tri-partitions, Smith Normal Form, discrete Morse theory). These results refine the combinatorial homology theory and provide novel ideas to gain more control over the computation of homology generators.</description>

      <title>Core Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to recognize a geometric shape from a noisy sample in the form of a point cloud. Inspired by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we introduce the core dissimilarity, from which we construct the core bifiltration. We also consider the Delaunay core bifiltration by intersecting with Voronoi cells, giving us a filtered simplicial complex of smaller size. A major advantage of the (Delaunay) core bifiltration is that, for each filtration value, it admits a good cover of balls. By the persistent nerve theorem, the nerve of this cover is homotopy equivalent to the (Delaunay) core bifiltration. We show that the multicover-, core- and Delaunay core bifiltrations are all interleaved, and that they enjoy similar stability properties with respect to the Prohorov distance. We have performed experiments with the Delaunay core bifiltration. In the experiments, we calculated persistent homology along lines in the two-dimensional persistence parameter space, as well as multipersistence module approximations and Hilbert functions for the full Delaunay core bifiltration.</description>

      <title>On Zarankiewicz's Problem for Intersection Hypergraphs of Geometric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypergraph Zarankiewicz's problem, introduced by Erd\H{o}s in 1964, asks for the maximum number of hyperedges in an $r$-partite hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each part that does not contain a copy of $K_{t,t,\ldots,t}$. Erd\H{o}s obtained a near optimal bound of $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ for general hypergraphs. In recent years, several works obtained improved bounds under various algebraic assumptions -- e.g., if the hypergraph is semialgebraic.
  In this paper we study the problem in a geometric setting -- for $r$-partite intersection hypergraphs of families of geometric objects. Our main results are essentially sharp bounds for families of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and families of pseudo-discs. For axis-parallel boxes, we obtain the sharp bound $O_{d,r}(tn^{r-1}(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})^{d-1})$. The best previous bound was larger by a factor of about $(\log n)^{d(2^{r-1}-2)}$. For pseudo-discs, we obtain the bound $O_r(tn^{r-1}(\log n)^{r-2})$, which is sharp up to logarithmic factors. As this hypergraph has no algebraic structure, no improvement of Erd\H{o}s' 60-year-old $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ bound was known for this setting. Futhermore, even in the special case of discs for which the semialgebraic structure can be used, our result improves the best known result by a factor of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{\frac{2r-2}{3r-2}})$.
  To obtain our results, we use the recently improved results for the graph Zarankiewicz's problem in the corresponding settings, along with a variety of combinatorial and geometric techniques, including shallow cuttings, biclique covers, transversals, and planarity.</description>

      <title>Geodesic complexity of the octahedron, and an algorithm for cut loci on convex polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesic complexity of a length space $X$ quantifies the required number of case distinctions to continuously choose a shortest path connecting any given start and end point. We prove a local lower bound for the geodesic complexity of $X$ obtained by embedding simplices into $X\times X$. We additionally create and prove correctness of an algorithm to find cut loci on surfaces of convex polyhedra, as the structure of a space's cut loci is related to its geodesic complexity. We use these techniques to prove the geodesic complexity of the octahedron is four. Our method is inspired by earlier work of Recio-Mitter and Davis, and thus recovers their results on the geodesic complexity of the $n$-torus and the tetrahedron, respectively.</description>

      <title>No Infinite $(p,q)$-Theorem for Piercing Compact Convex Sets with Lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite $(p,q)$-theorem, or an $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem, involving two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of sets, states that if in every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ sets that are intersected by some set in $\mathcal{G}$, then there is a finite set $S_{\mathcal{F}}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ such that for every $C\in\mathcal{F}$, there is a $B\in S_{\mathcal{F}}$ with $C\cap B\neq\emptyset$. We provide an example demonstrating that there is no $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem for piercing compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with lines by constructing a family $\mathcal{F}$ of compact convex sets such that it does not have a finite line transversal, but for any $t\in\mathbb{N}$, every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains $t$ sets that are pierced by a line.</description>
