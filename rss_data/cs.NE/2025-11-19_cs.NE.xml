      <title>MS2Edge: Towards Energy-Efficient and Crisp Edge Detection with Multi-Scale Residual Learning in SNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has achieved remarkable prog\-ress but faces two major challenges. First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption. Second, the predicted edges perform poorly in crispness and heavily rely on post-processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2Edge outperforms ANN-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM datasets without pre-trained backbones, while maintaining ultralow energy consumption and generating crisp edge maps without post-processing.</description>

      <title>Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, an input sequence is processed by a recurrent neural network, the reservoir, which transforms it into a spatial pattern that a shallow readout network can then exploit for tasks such as memorization and time-series prediction or classification. Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Attention via Synaptic Plasticity is All You Need: A Biologically Inspired Spiking Neuromorphic Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.</description>

      <title>QUASAR: An Evolutionary Algorithm to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.
  Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.
  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Evolving Generalizable Parallel Algorithm Portfolios for Binary Optimization Problems via Domain-Agnostic Instance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key novelty of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that eliminates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these problem classes, DACE, without requiring domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with even better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a "ridge of optimization," where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct "driving" force and an indirect "feedback" force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.</description>
