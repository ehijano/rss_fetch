      <title>CCAT: A status update on the EoR-Spec instrument module for Prime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization Spectrometer (EoR-Spec) is an upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) instrument designed to study the evolution of the early universe (z = 3.5 to 8) by probing the redshifted [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line from aggregates of galaxies. The [CII] emission is an excellent tracer of star formation since it is the dominant cooling line from neutral gas heated by OB star light and thus can be used to probe the reionization of the early Universe due to star formation. EoR-Spec will be deployed on Prime-Cam, a modular direct-detection receiver for the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), currently under construction by CPI Vertex Antennentechnik GmbH and to be installed near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert. This instrument features an image plane populated with more than 6500 Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that are illuminated by a 4-lens optical design with a cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) at the pupil of the optical system. The FPI is designed to provide a spectral resolving power of $R\sim100$ over the full spectral range of 210--420 GHz. EoR-Spec will tomographically survey the E-COSMOS and E-CDFS fields with a depth of about 4000 hours over a 5 year period. Here we give an update on EoR-Spec's final mechanical/optical design and the current status of fabrication, characterization and testing towards first light in 2026.</description>

      <title>Simulated performance of energy-resolving detectors towards exoplanet imaging with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary science goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as defined by the Astro2020 decadal survey is the imaging of the first Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star. A key technology gap towards reaching this goal are the development of ultra-low-noise photon counting detectors capable of measuring the incredibly low count rates coming from these planets which are at contrasts of $\sim 1 \times 10^{-10}$. Superconducting energy-resolving detectors (ERDs) are a promising technology for this purpose as, despite their technological challenges, needing to be cooled below their superconducting transition temperature ($&lt; 1\mathrm{K}$), they have essentially zero read noise, dark current, or clock-induced charge, and can get the wavelength of each incident photon without the use of additional throughput-reducing filters or gratings that spread light over many pixels. The use of these detectors on HWO will not only impact the science of the mission by decreasing the required exposure times for exo-Earth detection and characterization, but also in a wavefront sensing and control context when used for starlight suppression to generate a dark zone. We show simulated results using both an EMCCD and an ERD to ``dig a dark zone'' demonstrating that ERDs can achieve the same final contrast as an EMCCD in about half of the total time. We also perform a simple case study using an exposure time calculator tool called the Error Budget Software (EBS) to determine the required integration times to detect water for HWO targets of interest using both EMCCDs and ERDs. This shows that once a dark zone is achieved, using an ERD can decrease these exposure times by factors of 1.5--2 depending on the specific host star properties.</description>

      <title>Use Model Averaging instead of Model Selection in Pulsar Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analyzed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as ``circular analysis.'' This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to Log-Uniform priors.</description>

      <title>Contour Analysis Tool: an interactive tool for background and morphology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Contour Analysis Tool (CAT), a Python toolkit aimed at identifying and analyzing structural elements in density maps. CAT employs various contouring techniques, including the lowest-closed contour (LCC), linear and logarithmic Otsu thresholding, and average gradient thresholding. These contours can aid in foreground and background segmentation, providing natural limits for both, as well as edge detection and structure identification. Additionally, CAT provides image processing methods such as smoothing, background removal, and image masking. The toolkit features an interactive suite of controls designed for Jupyter environments, enabling users to promptly visualize the effects of different methods and parameters. We describe, test, and demonstrate the performance of CAT, highlighting its potential use cases. CAT is publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and collaboration.</description>

      <title>CTC and CT5TEA: an advanced multi-channel digitizer and trigger ASIC for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new set of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) of the TARGET family (CTC and CT5TEA), designed for the readout of signals from photosensors in cameras of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. We present the performance and design details. Both ASICs feature 16 channels, with CTC being a Switched-Capacitor Array (SCA) sampler at 0.5 to 1 GSa/s with a 16,384 sample deep storage buffer, including the functionality to digitize full waveforms at arbitrary times. CT5TEA is its companion trigger ASIC (though may be used on its own), which provides trigger information for the analog sum of four (and 16) adjacent channels. Since sampling and triggering takes place in two separate ASICs, the noise due to interference from the SCA is suppressed, and allows a minimal trigger threshold of $\leq$ 2.5 mV (0.74 photo electrons (p.e.)) with a trigger noise of $\leq$ 0.5 mV (0.15 p.e.). For CTC, a maximal input voltage range from $-$0.5 V up to 1.7 V is achieved with an effective bit range of $&gt;$ 11.6 bits and a baseline noise of 0.7 mV. The cross-talk improved to $\leq$ 1% over the whole $-$3 dB bandwidth of 220 MHz and even down to 0.2% for 1.5 V pulses of 10 ns width. Not only is the performance presented, but a temperature-stable calibration routine for pulse mode operation is introduced and validated. The resolution is found to be $\sim$ 2.5% at 33.7 mV (10 p.e.) and $\leq$ 0.3% at 337 mV (100 p.e.) with an integrated non-linearity of $&lt;$ 1.6 mV. Developed for the Small-Sized Telescope (SST) and Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) cameras of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), CTC and CT5TEA are deployed for both prototypes and shall be integrated into the final versions.</description>

      <title>Blind source separation in 3rd generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third generation and future upgrades of current gravitational-wave detectors will present exquisite sensitivities which will allow to detect a plethora of gravitational wave signals. Hence, a new problem to be solved arises: the detection and parameter estimation of overlapped signals. The problem of separating and identifying two signals that overlap in time, space or frequency is something well known in other fields (e.g. medicine and telecommunication). Blind source separation techniques are all those methods that aim at separating two or more unknown signals. This article provides a methodological review of the most common blind source separation techniques and it analyses whether they can be successfully applied to overlapped gravitational wave signals or not, while comparing the limits and advantages of each method.</description>

      <title>An Instrument Error Budget for Space-Based Absolute Flux Measurements of the Sky Synchrotron Spectrum Below 20 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the instrumental error budget for space-based measurements of the absolute flux of the sky synchrotron spectrum at frequencies below the ionospheric cutoff (&lt;20 MHz). We focus on an architecture using electrically short dipoles onboard a small satellite. The error budget combines the contributions of the dipole dimensions, plasma noise, stray capacitance, and front-end amplifier input impedance. We treat the errors using both a Monte Carlo error propagation model and an analytical method. This error budget can be applied to a variety of experiments and used to ultimately improve the sensing capabilities of space-based electrically short dipole instruments. The impact of individual uncertainty components, particularly stray capacitance, is explored in more detail.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral performance of the Sony IMX290 CMOS sensor near Fano limit after a per-pixel gain calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of back-illuminated complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors and their well-known advantages over charge-coupled devices (CCDs) make them an attractive technology for future X-ray missions. However, numerous challenges remain, including improving their depletion depth and identifying effective methods to calculate per-pixel gain conversion. We have tested a commercial Sony IMX290LLR CMOS sensor under X-ray light using an $^{55}$Fe radioactive source and collected X-ray photons for $\sim$15 consecutive days under stable conditions at regulated temperatures of 21{\deg}C and 26{\deg}C. At each temperature, the data set contained enough X-ray photons to produce one spectrum per pixel consisting only of single-pixel events. We determined the gain dispersion of its 2.1 million pixels using the peak fitting and the Energy Calibration by Correlation (ECC) methods. We measured a gain dispersion of 0.4\% at both temperatures and demonstrated the advantage of the ECC method in the case of spectra with low statistics. The energy resolution at 5.9 keV after the per-pixel gain correction is improved by $\gtrsim$10 eV for single-pixel and all event spectra, with single-pixel event energy resolution reaching $123.6\pm 0.2$ eV, close to the Fano limit of silicon sensors at room temperature. Finally, our long data acquisition demonstrated the excellent stability of the detector over more than 30 days under a flux of $10^4$ photons per second.</description>

      <title>A Binary Neutron Star Merger Search Pipeline Powered by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are now routinely detected from compact binary mergers, with binary neutron star mergers being of note for multi-messenger astronomy as they have been observed to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Novel search pipelines for these mergers could increase the combined search sensitivity, and could improve the ability to detect real gravitational wave signals in the presence of glitches and non-stationary detector noise. Deep learning has found success in other areas of gravitational wave data analysis, but a sensitive deep learning-based search for binary neutron star mergers has proven elusive due to their long signal length. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline for detecting binary neutron star mergers. By training a convolutional neural network to detect binary neutron star mergers in the signal-to-noise ratio time series, we concentrate signal power into a shorter and more consistent timescale than strain-based methods, while also being able to train our network to be robust against glitches. We compare our pipeline's sensitivity to the three offline detection pipelines using injections in real gravitational wave data, and find that our pipeline has a comparable sensitivity to the current pipelines below the 1 per 2 months detection threshold. Furthermore, we find that our pipeline can increase the total number of binary neutron star detections by 12% at a false alarm rate of 1 per 2 months. The pipeline is also able to successfully detect the two binary neutron star mergers detected so far by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425, despite the loud glitch present in GW170817.</description>

      <title>Sifting the debris: Patterns in the SNR population with unsupervised ML methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) carry vast amounts of mechanical and radiative energy that heavily influence the structural, dynamical, and chemical evolution of galaxies. To this day, more than 300 SNRs have been discovered in the Milky Way, exhibiting a wide variety of observational features. However, existing classification schemes are mainly based on their radio morphology. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning pipeline to analyse a representative subsample of the Galactic SNR population ($\sim$ 50% of the total) with the aim of finding a connection between their multi-wavelength features and their physical properties. The pipeline involves two stages: (1) a representation learning stage, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder that feeds on imagery from infrared and radio continuum surveys (WISE 22$\mu$m, Hi-GAL 70 $\mu$m and SMGPS 30 cm) and produces a compact representation in a lower-dimensionality latent space; and (2) a clustering stage that seeks meaningful clusters in the latent space that can be linked to the physical properties of the SNRs and their surroundings. Our results suggest that this approach, when combined with an intermediate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) reprojection of the autoencoded embeddings into a more clusterable manifold, enables us to find reliable clusters. Despite a large number of sources being classified as outliers, most clusters relate to the presence of distinctive features, such as the distribution of infrared emission, the presence of radio shells and pulsar wind nebulae, and the existence of dust filaments.</description>

      <title>Validation of straight-line signal propagation for radio signal of very inclined cosmic ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural non-uniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. This while the refraction due to a non-uniform atmosphere is expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction that is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of assuming straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end-point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find that including ray curvature effects into the end-point formalism calculation introduces changes of up to a few percent in fluence for frequencies up to 1.2 GHz and zenith angles up to 88{\deg}.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Haloscopes as Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that dielectric haloscopes like MADMAX, originally designed for detecting axion dark matter, are also very promising gravitational wave detectors. Operated in resonant mode at frequencies around $\mathcal{O}(10\,\text{GHz})$, these detectors benefit from enhanced gravitational wave to photon conversion at the surfaces of a stack of thin dielectric disks. Since the gravitational wave is relativistic, there is an additional enhancement of the signal compared to the axion case due to increased conversion probability of gravitational waves to photons in the vacuum between the disks. A gravitational wave search using a dielectric haloscope imposes stringent requirements on the disk thickness and placement, but relaxed requirements on the disk smoothness. An advantage is the possibility of a broadband or hybrid resonant/broadband operation mode, which extends the frequency range down to $\mathcal{O}(100\,\text{MHz})$. We show that strain sensitivities down to $10^{-21} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ will be possible in the coming years for the broadband setup, while a resonant setup optimized for gravitational waves could even reach $3\times 10^{-23} \text{Hz}^{-1/2} \times (10\,\text{GHz}/f)$ with current technology.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray transients ranging from 20 keV to 1 MeV. GTM is equipped with 5 Gamma-ray Transient Probe (GTP) detector modules, utilizing the NaI(Tl) scintillator coupled with a SiPM array. To reduce the SiPM noise, GTP makes use of a dedicated dual-channel coincident readout design. In this work, we firstly studied the impact of different coincidence times on detection efficiency and ultimately selected the 500 ns time coincidence window for offline data processing. To test the performance of GTPs and validate the Monte Carlo simulated energy response, we conducted comprehensive ground calibration tests using Hard X-ray Calibration Facility (HXCF) and radioactive sources, including energy response, detection efficiency, spatial response, bias-voltage response, and temperature dependence. We extensively presented the ground calibration results, and validated the design and mass model of GTP detector. These work paved the road for the in-flight observation and science data analysis.</description>

      <title>Panopticon: a telescope for our times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a design for a wide-field spectroscopic telescope. The only large powered mirror is spherical, the resulting spherical aberration is corrected for each target separately, giving exceptional image quality. The telescope is a transit design, but still allows all-sky coverage. Three simultaneous modes are proposed: (a) natural seeing multi-object spectroscopy with 12m aperture over 3dg FoV with ~25,000 targets; (b) multi-object AO with 12m aperture over 3dg FoV with ~100 AO-corrected Integral Field Units each with 4 arcsec FoV; (c) ground layer AO-corrected integral field spectroscopy with 15m aperture and 13 arcmin FoV. Such a telescope would be uniquely powerful for large-area follow-up of imaging surveys; in each mode, the AOmega and survey speed exceed all existing facilities combined. The expected cost of this design is relatively modest, much closer to $500M than $1000M.</description>
