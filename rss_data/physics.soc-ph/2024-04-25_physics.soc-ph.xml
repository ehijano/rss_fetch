      <title>Renewable Technologies: Advantages, Disadvantages and Strategic Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article evaluates the types of typical renewable energy technologies separately. Switching from fossil-fuel-based technology to green energies is time-consuming and requires a high investment cost. In addition, the production of energy by new technology may cause the deactivation of some power plants, which will result in unemployment and negative economic growth impacts. In this research, the policies of different countries have been investigated, and strategies for developing these resources have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Epidemic risk perception and social interactions lead to awareness cascades on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The course of an epidemic is not only shaped by infection transmission over face-to-face contacts, but also by preventive behaviour caused by risk perception and social interactions. This study explores the dynamics of coupled awareness and biological infection spread within a two-layer multiplex network framework. One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge. Under these conditions, the combination of a small-world face-to-face and a scale-free social layer, but not vice versa, make that the extent of the infections decreases with increasing transmission probability.</description>

      <title>Detecting self-organising patterns in crowd motion: Effect of optimisation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating process of urbanization has raised concerns about incidents arising from overcrowding, necessitating a deep understanding of large human crowd behavior and the development of effective crowd management strategies. This study employs computational methods to analyze real-world crowd behaviors, emphasizing self-organizing patterns. Notably, the intersection of two streams of individuals triggers the spontaneous emergence of striped patterns, validated through both simulations and live human experiments. Addressing a gap in computational methods for studying these patterns, previous research utilized the pattern-matching technique, employing the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm for fitting a two-dimensional sinusoidal function to pedestrian coordinates. This paper advances the pattern-matching procedure by introducing Simulated Annealing as the optimization algorithm and employing a two-dimensional square wave for data fitting. The amalgamation of Simulated Annealing and the square wave significantly enhances pattern fitting quality, validated through statistical hypothesis tests. The study concludes by outlining potential applications of this method across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks towards consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</description>

      <title>Structural insulators and promotors in networks under generic problem-solving dynamics</title>

Abstract: The collective coordination of distributed tasks in a complex system can be represented as decision dynamics on a graph. This abstract representation allows studying the performance of local decision heuristics as a function of task complexity and network architecture. Here we identify hard-to-solve and easy-to-solve networks in a social differentiation task within the basic model of small-world graphs. We show that, depending on the details of the decision heuristic as well as the length of the added links, shortcuts can serve as structural promotors, which speed up convergence towards a solution, but also as structural insulators, which make the network more difficult to solve. Our findings have implications for situations where, in distributed decision systems, regional solutions emerge, which are globally incompatible as for example during the emergence of technological standards.</description>

      <title>Perspective in Opinion Dynamics on Complex Convex Domains of Time Networks for Addiction, Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revises previous work and introduces changes in spatio-temporal scales. The paper presents a model that includes layers A and B with varying degrees of forgetting and dependence over time. We also model changes in dependence and forgetting in layers A, A', B, and B' under certain conditions. In addition, to discuss the formation of opinion clusters that have reinforcing or obstructive behaviors of forgetting and dependence and are conservative or brainwashing or detoxifying and less prone to filter bubbling, new clusters C and D that recommend, obstruct, block, or incite forgetting and dependence over time are Introduction. This introduction allows us to test hypotheses regarding the expansion of opinions in two dimensions over time and space, the state of development of opinion space, and the expansion of public opinion. Challenges in consensus building will be highlighted, emphasizing the dynamic nature of opinions and the need to consider factors such as dissent, distrust, and media influence. The paper proposes an extended framework that incorporates trust, distrust, and media influence into the consensus building model. We introduce network analysis using dimerizing as a method to gain deeper insights. In this context, we discuss network clustering, media influence, and consensus building. The location and distribution of dimers will be analyzed to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of the network. Dimertiling has been applied in various fields other than network analysis, such as physics and sociology. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of diverse perspectives, network analysis, and influential entities in consensus building. It also introduces torus-based visualizations that aid in understanding complex network structures.</description>

      <title>From Spin States to Socially Integrated Ising Models: Proposed Applications of Graph States, Stabilizer States, Toric States to Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has developed the Ising model from physics, especially statistical mechanics, and it plays an important role in quantum computing, especially quantum annealing and quantum Monte Carlo methods. The model has also been used in opinion dynamics as a powerful tool for simulating social interactions and opinion formation processes. Individual opinions and preferences correspond to spin states, and social pressure and communication dynamics are modeled through interactions between spins. Quantum computing makes it possible to efficiently simulate these interactions and analyze more complex social networks.Recent research has incorporated concepts from quantum information theory such as Graph State, Stabilizer State, and Surface Code (or Toric Code) into models of opinion dynamics. The incorporation of these concepts allows for a more detailed analysis of the process of opinion formation and the dynamics of social networks. The concepts lie at the intersection of graph theory and quantum theory, and the use of Graph State in opinion dynamics can represent the interdependence of opinions and networks of influence among individuals. It helps to represent the local stability of opinions and the mechanisms for correcting misunderstandings within a social network. It allows us to understand how individual opinions are subject to social pressures and cultural influences and how they change over time.Incorporating these quantum theory concepts into opinion dynamics allows for a deeper understanding of social interactions and opinion formation processes. Moreover, these concepts can provide new insights not only in the social sciences, but also in fields as diverse as political science, economics, marketing, and urban planning.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy Spread of Online Opinion Polarization: The Pivotal Role of Super-Spreaders in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study investigates the role of 'superspreaders' in shaping opinions within networks, distinguishing three types: A, B, and C. Type A has a significant influence in shaping opinions, Type B acts as a counterbalance to A, and Type C functions like media, providing an objective viewpoint and potentially regulating A and B's influence. The research uses a confidence coefficient and z-score to survey superspreaders' behaviors, with a focus on the conditions affecting group dynamics and opinion formation, including environmental factors and forgetfulness over time. The findings offer insights for improving online communication security and understanding social influence. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>
