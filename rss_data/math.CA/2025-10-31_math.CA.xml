      <title>Algebraic interpretation of discrete families of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic interpretation of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials (MVOPs) is provided. The construction is based on representations of a ($q$-deformed) Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ into the algebra $\operatorname{End}_{M_n(\mathbb{C})}(M)$ of $M_n(\mathbb{C})$-linear maps over a $M_n(\mathbb{C})$-module $M$. Cases corresponding to the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(1, 1)$ as well as to the $q$-deformed algebra $\mathfrak{so}_q(3)$ at $q$ a root of unity are presented; they lead to matrix analogs of the Krawtchouk, Meixner and discrete Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sparse Bounds and Commutator Characterizations Without Doubling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine dyadic paraproducts and commutators in the non-homogeneous setting, where the underlying Borel measure $\mu$ is not assumed to be doubling. We first establish a pointwise sparse domination for dyadic paraproducts and related operators with symbols $b \in \textrm{BMO}(\mu)$, improving upon an earlier result of Lacey, where the symbol $b$ was assumed to satisfy a stronger Carleson-type condition, that coincides with $\textrm{BMO}$ only in the doubling setting. As an application of this result, we obtain sharpened weighted inequalities for the commutator of a dyadic Hilbert transform $\mathcal{H}$ previously studied by Borges, Conde Alonso, Pipher, and the third author. We also characterize the symbols for which the commutator $[\mathcal{H},b]$ is bounded on $L^p(\mu)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and provide some interesting examples to prove that this class of symbols strictly depends on $p$ and is nested between symbols satisfying the $p$-Carleson packing condition and symbols belonging to martingale BMO (even in the case of absolutely continuous measures).</description>

      <title>Refined additive uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal recovery from incomplete or partial frequency information is a fundamental problem in harmonic analysis and applied mathematics, with wide-ranging applications in communications, imaging, and data science. Historically, the classical uncertainty principles, such as those by Donoho and Stark, have provided essential bounds relating the sparsity of a signal and its Fourier transform, ensuring unique recovery under certain support size constraints.
  Recent advances have incorporated additive combinatorial notions, notably additive energy, to refine these uncertainty principles and capture deeper structural properties of signal supports. Building upon this line of work, we present a strengthened additive energy uncertainty principle for functions $f:\mathbb{Z}_N^d\to\mathbb{C}$, introducing explicit correction terms that measure how far the supports are from highly structured extremal sets like subgroup cosets.
  We have two main results. Our first theorem introduces a correction term which strictly improves the additive energy uncertainty principle from Aldahleh et al., provided that the classical uncertainty principle is not satisfied with equality. Our second theorem uses the improvement to obtain a better recovery condition. These theorems deliver strictly improved bounds over prior results whenever the product of the support sizes differs from the ambient dimension, offering a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between additive structure and Fourier sparsity. Importantly, we leverage these improvements to establish sharper sufficient conditions for unique and exact recovery of signals from partially observed frequencies, explicitly quantifying the role of additive energy in recoverability.</description>

      <title>A note on the tetrahedral index and the Hahn-Exton q-Bessel function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is twofold: First to elucidate some connections between the ``building block'' of Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov's $3$D index, known as the tetrahedral index $I_\Delta (m,e)$, and Hahn--Exton's $q$-analogue of the Bessel function $J_\nu (z;q)$. The correspondence between $I_\Delta$ and $J_\nu$ will allow us to translate useful relations from one setting to the other. Second, we want to introduce to the $q$-hypergeometric community some possibly new techniques, theory and conjectures arising from applications of physical mathematics to geometric topology.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of the regular n-gon elliptic relative equilibrium in the planar n-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regular $n$-gon elliptic relative equilibrium (ERE) is a Kepler homographic solution generated by the regular $n$-gon central configuration, and its linear stability depends on the eccentricity $\mathfrak{e}\in[0,1)$. While Moeckel \cite{Moe1} established the spectral instability for this solution at $\mathfrak{e}=0$ for all $n\geq3$, it remained unknown whether instability persists for $\mathfrak{e} \in (0,1)$. This paper resolves this problem: we prove that the regular $n$-gon ERE is spectral instability for all $n\geq 3$ and $\mathfrak{e} \in [0,1)$. Furthermore, we introduce the $\beta$-system which related the Lagrange solution, and we developed an estimation method that, by testing the hyperbolicity of the $\beta$-system at a finite number of points alone, allows us to obtain extensive hyperbolic regions. As a corollary, for $n=3,4,5$, we uniformly demonstrate that the instability is hyperbolic (and hence stronger) for all $\mathfrak{e} \in [0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Integration in finite terms and exponentially algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions?
  These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</description>

      <title>Additive structures imply more distances in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances.
  In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if \[ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, \] then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</description>

      <title>Heilbronn's triangle problem in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that among any $n$ points in the unit cube one can find a triangle of area at most $n^{-2/3-c}$ for some absolute constant $c &gt;0$. This gives the first non-trivial upper bound for the three-dimensional version of Heilbronn's triangle problem. This estimate is a consequence of the following result about configurations of point-line pairs in $\mathbb R^3$: for $n \ge 2$ let $p_1, \ldots,p_n \in [0,1]^3$ be a collection of points and let $\ell_i$ be a line through $p_i$ for every $i$ such that $d(p_i, \ell_j) \ge \delta$ for all $i\neq j$. Then we have $n \lesssim \delta^{-3+\gamma}$ for some absolute constant $\gamma&gt;0$. The analogous result about point-line configurations in the plane was previously established by Cohen, Pohoata and the last author.</description>

      <title>A Radial and Tangential Framework for Studying Transient Reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modeling biological systems and other applications, an important recurring question is whether those systems maintain healthy regimes not just at dynamic attractors but also during transient excursions away from those attractors. For ODE models, these excursions are not due only to nonlinearities. Even in a linear, autonomous system with a global attractor at the origin, some trajectories will move transiently away from the origin before eventually being attracted asymptotically. Reactivity, defined by Neubert and Caswell in 1997, captures this idea of transient amplification of perturbations by measuring the maximum instantaneous rate of radial growth. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for analyzing reactivity and transient dynamics in two-dimensional linear ODEs using a radial and tangential decomposition of the vector field. We establish how to view the eigen-structure of the system through this lens and introduce a matching structure of orthovectors and orthovalues that characterize where the radial velocity becomes positive. From this perspective, we gain geometric insight about the regions of state space where positive radial growth occurs and how solutions trajectories traverse through these regions. Additionally, we propose four standard matrix forms that characterize both transient and asymptotic behavior and which highlight reactivity features more directly. Finally, we apply our framework to explore the limits of reactivity and maximal amplification and to characterize how transient reactivity can accumulate in nonautonomous linear systems to result in asymptotically unstable behavior.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Krall polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we exhibit and study a novel class of exceptional Krall orthogonal polynomials of Hermite type. This means that the polynomials in question are (i) orthogonal with respect to a Hermite-type weight; (ii) are the eigenfunctions of a higher-order differential operator; (iii) the degree sequence of the polynomial family in question is missing a finite number of degrees. Regarding the second point, unlike the known class of exceptional Hermite polynomials that satisfy a second-order eigenvalue equation, the polynomials we introduce here are not eigenfunctions of any 2nd order differential operator, but are for one of 4th order. Regarding the third point, our family does not include a polynomial of degree zero and consequently satisfies a 5th order recurrence relation instead of the classical 3-term relation.</description>
