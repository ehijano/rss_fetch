      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>

      <title>Characteristic scales and adaptation in higher-order contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People organize in groups and contagions spread across them. A simple stochastic process, yet complex to model due to dynamical correlations within and between groups. Moreover, groups can evolve if agents join or leave in response to contagions. To address the lack of analytical models that account for dynamical correlations and adaptation in groups, we introduce the method of generalized approximate master equations. We first analyze how nonlinear contagions differ when driven by group-level or individual-level dynamics. We then study the characteristic levels of group activity that best describe the stochastic process and that optimize agents' ability to adapt to it. Naturally lending itself to study adaptive hypergraphs, our method reveals how group structure unlocks new dynamical regimes and enables distinct suitable adaptation strategies. Our approach offers a highly accurate model of binary-state dynamics on hypergraphs, advances our understanding of contagion processes, and opens the study of adaptive group-structured systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscalarity in Socio-Spatial Segregation: An Information-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework to examine socio-spatial segregation across multiple spatial scales, explicitly leveraging information theory and percolation theory. This framework emphasizes the interplay between regional connectivity and population distribution, which are critical for understanding how spatial inequalities arise and persist in urban regions. Employing the Generalised Jensen-Shannon Divergence (GJSD), this method identifies regions characterized by significant segregation and low connectivity, providing actionable insights for targeted urban interventions. Using Ecuador as a case study, we demonstrate how segregation patterns manifest differently at city, regional, and national scales, underscoring the critical role of multiscalarity in understanding urban inequalities and guiding scale-sensitive policies. This approach not only advances the methodology for studying socio-spatial segregation but also contributes to the broader field by highlighting the importance of considering multiscalar perspectives and connectivity in urban systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Distance on Epidemiological Dynamics in Human Connection Network with Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of infectious diseases is often influenced by human mobility across different geographical regions. Although numerous studies have investigated how diseases like SARS and COVID-19 spread from China to various global locations, there remains a gap in understanding how the movement of individuals contributes to disease transmission on a more personal or human-to-human level. Typically, researchers have employed the concept of metapopulation movement to analyze how diseases move from one location to another. This paper shifts focus to the dynamics of disease transmission, incorporating the critical factor of distance between an infected person and a healthy individual during human movement. The study delves into the impact of distance on various parameters of epidemiological dynamics throughout human mobility. Mathematical expressions for important epidemiological metrics, such as the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the critical infection rate ($\beta_{critical}$), are derived in relation to the distance between individuals. The results indicate that the proposed model closely aligns with observed patterns of COVID-19 spread based on the analysis done on the available datasets.</description>

      <title>Measuring inequality in society-oriented Lotka--Volterra-type kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a possible approach to measuring inequality in a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations that describe the evolution of distribution densities for two populations interacting pairwise due to social and/or economic factors. The macroscopic dynamics of their mean values follow a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations. Unlike classical models of wealth and opinion formation, which tend to converge toward a steady-state profile, the oscillatory behavior of these densities only leads to the formation of local equilibria within the Fokker-Planck system. This makes tracking the evolution of most inequality measures challenging. However, an insightful perspective on the problem is obtained by using the coefficient of variation, a simple inequality measure closely linked to the Gini index. Numerical experiments confirm that, despite the system's oscillatory nature, inequality initially tends to decrease.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits a gradual period-doubling route to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Universal expansion of human mobility across urban scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility is a fundamental process underpinning socioeconomic life and urban structure. Classic theories, such as egocentric activity spaces and central place theory, provide crucial insights into specific facets of movement, like home-centricity and hierarchical spatial organization. However, identifying universal characteristics or an underlying principle that quantitatively links these disparate perspectives has remained a challenge. Here, we reveal such a connection by analyzing the spatial structure of individual daily mobility trajectories using network-based modules. We discover a universal scaling law: the spatial extent (radius) of these mobility modules expands sublinearly with increasing distance from home, a pattern consistent across three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these modules precisely map onto the nested hierarchy of urban systems, corresponding to local, city-level, and regional scales as distance from home increases. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics and demonstrate the profound connection between classical urban theory, human geography, and mobility studies.</description>

      <title>Switching exploration modes in human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in human mobility research have revealed consistent pairwise characteristics in movement behavior, yet existing mobility models often overlook the spatial and topological structure of mobility networks. By analyzing millions of devices' anonymized cell phone trajectories, we uncover a distinct modular organization within these networks, demonstrating that movements within spatial modules differ significantly from those between modules. This finding challenges the conventional assumption of uniform mobility dynamics and underscores the influence of heterogeneous environments on human movement. Inspired by switching behaviors in animal movement patterns, we introduce a novel "switch mechanism" to differentiate movement modes, allowing our model to accurately reproduce both the modular structures of trajectory networks and spatial mobility patterns. Our results provide new insights into the dynamics of human mobility and its impact on network formation, with broad applications in traffic prediction, disease transmission modeling, and urban planning. Beyond advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of mobility networks, this work opens new avenues for understanding societal dynamics at large.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process for Horse Race Betting: A Micro-Macro Analysis of Herding and Informed Bettors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the time evolution of single win odds in Japanese horse racing as a stochastic process, deriving an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process by analyzing the probability dynamics of vote shares and the empirical time series of odds movements. Our framework incorporates two types of bettors: herders, who adjust their bets based on current odds, and fundamentalists, who wager based on a horse's true winning probability. Using data from 3450 Japan Racing Association races in 2008, we identify a microscopic probability rule governing individual bets and a mean-reverting macroscopic pattern in odds convergence. This structure parallels financial markets, where traders' decisions are influenced by market fluctuations, and the interplay between herding and fundamentalist strategies shapes price dynamics. These results highlight the broader applicability of our approach to non-equilibrium financial and betting markets, where mean-reverting dynamics emerge from simple behavioral interactions.</description>

      <title>A Review of Stop-and-Go Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, secondary waves, generalizability, traffic state estimation and prediction, robustness to randomness, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.</description>

      <title>Why is distortion inevitable in opinion propagation on social media? Noise induced layer-wised synchronization in Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media as a dominant information propagation platform has intensified scholarly concerns about systemic information distortion,a phenomenon where content undergoes progressive alteration during multi layered transmission. However, existing literature extensively documents distortion patterns, the fundamental mechanisms coupling network architecture with cognitive noise remain poorly quantified. Here, we introduce a novel fractal network with coupled Noise Frustrated Hegselmann Krause (NFHK) framework that systematically disentangles these intertwined factors. By integrating fractal topology analysis with modified bounded confidence dynamics, our model reveals how hierarchical network structures (characterized by scale invariant connectivity patterns) amplify stochastic noise through successive retransmission layers. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, multi agent simulations, and empirical validation of typical retweet cascades, we demonstrate two key phenomena: (i) distortion escalates super linearly with network depth and (ii) peer nodes exhibit emergent layer wise synchronization despite lacking direct connections among themselves and form a number of synchronous groups based on the number of network layers. These findings establish a unified mechanism explaining distortion accumulation in digital ecosystems while challenging conventional "echo chamber" narratives. Our noise frustration protocol can offer actionable insights for policymakers to design topology aware regulatory frameworks. This work bridges complex systems theory with computational social science, providing both a mathematical foundation for distortion analysis and a toolkit for platform governance.</description>
