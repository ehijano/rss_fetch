      <title>Legendrian Non-simple Whitehead Doubles Of The Trefoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ozsv\'ath and Stipsicz showed that some Eliashberg-Chekanov twist knots, which are Whitehead doubles of the unknot, are not Legendrian simple. We extend their result by considering some Whitehead doubles of the trefoil: Using properties of knot Floer homology and the distinguished surgery triangle, we show that this family of knots is Legendrian non-simple in the standard contact 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Fixed Point Assertions in Digital Topology, 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of fixed points in digital metric spaces has drawn yet more publications with assertions that are incorrect, incorrectly proven, trivial, or incoherently stated. We discuss publications with bad assertions concerning fixed points of self-functions on digital images, as in some of our previous papers.</description>

      <title>Tiling Hyperbolic Manifolds: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new tiling algorithm for hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We use it to compute the maximal cusp area matrix; this completely characterizes the space of all embedded and disjoint cusp neighborhoods. As another application of our work, we find the Epstein-Penner decomposition answering a challenge of Sakuma and Weeks. We furthermore provide the refinements needed to make our algorithm verified: producing intervals provably containing the correct answer. As key ingredient for our work and perhaps of independent interest, we give new and simpler expressions for the distances between points, lines, and planes in the hyperboloid model.</description>

      <title>Skein module dimensions of mapping tori of the 2-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07332v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the dimension of the Kauffman bracket skein module at generic $q$ for mapping tori of the 2-torus, generalising the well-known computation of Carrega and Gilmer. In the process, we give a decomposition of the twisted Hochschild homology of the $G$-skein algebra for $G = \mathrm{SL}_N$ or $\mathrm{GL}_N$, which is a direct summand of the whole skein module, and from which the dimensions follow easily in the cases $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$ and $G = \mathrm{GL}_1$.</description>

      <title>Khovanov homology and exotic $4$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Khovanov-Rozansky $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ skein lasagna module distinguishes the exotic pair of knot traces $X_{-1}(-5_2)$ and $X_{-1}(P(3,-3,-8))$, an example first discovered by Akbulut. This gives the first analysis-free proof of the existence of exotic compact orientable $4$-manifolds. We also present a family of exotic knot traces that seem not directly recoverable from gauge/Floer-theoretic methods. Along the way, we present new explicit calculations of the Khovanov skein lasagna modules, and we define lasagna generalizations of the Lee homology and Rasmussen $s$-invariant, which are of independent interest. Other consequences of our work include a slice obstruction of knots in $4$-manifolds with nonvanishing skein lasagna module, a sharp shake genus bound for some knots from the lasagna $s$-invariant, and a construction of induced maps on Khovanov homology for cobordisms in $k\mathbb{CP}^2$.</description>

      <title>Volume and topology of bounded and closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a compact, orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold whose boundary is a connected totally geodesic surface of genus $2$. If $N$ has Heegaard genus at least $5$, then its volume is greater than $2V_{\rm oct}$, where $V_{\rm oct}=3.66\ldots$ denotes the volume of a regular ideal hyperbolic octahedron in $\mathbb{H}^3$. This improves the lower bound given in our earlier paper ``Volume and topology of bounded and closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds.'' One ingredient in the improved bound is that in a crucial case, instead of using a single ``muffin'' in $N$ in the sense of Kojima and Miyamoto, we use two disjoint muffins. By combining the result about manifolds with geodesic boundary with the $\log(2k-1)$ theorem and results due to Agol-Culler-Shalen and Shalen-Wagreich, we show that if $M$ is a closed, orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold with $\mathop{\rm vol} M\le V_{\rm oct}/2$, then $\dim H_1(M;\mathbb{F}_2)\le4$. We also provide new lower bounds for the volumes of closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds whose cohomology ring over $\mathbb{F}_2$ satisfies certain restrictions; these improve results that were proved in ``Volume and topology$\ldots$.''</description>

      <title>Liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations and odd-th cyclic covers of genus one two-bridge knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $K$ be a genus one two-bridge knot. In the spirit of arithmetic topology, we observe that if $p$ divides the size of the 1st homology group of some odd-th cyclic branched cover of the knot $K$, then its group $\pi_1(S^3-K)$ admits a liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-character, where $\mathbb{Z}_p$ denotes the ring of $p$-adic integers. In addition, we discuss the existence of liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations and give a remark on a general two-bridge knot. In the course of argument, we also point out a constraint for prime numbers dividing certain Lucas-type sequences by using the Legendre symbols.</description>

      <title>Classification of Hyperbolic Dehn fillings II: Quadratic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is subsequent to [5]. In this paper, we extend the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings with sufficiently large coefficients by addressing the remaining case not covered in [5]. Specifically, by considering the case in which the two cusp shapes lie in the same quadratic field, we obtain the complete classification under a mild assumption satisfied by most manifolds.
  The content of this paper is not limited to the classification of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. Along the way, we also classify key types of automorphisms of the holonomy variety of a two-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold and uncover an intriguing hidden structure in the complex volume of certain manifolds. Concrete examples illustrating these phenomena were discovered by S. Oh, and we elaborate on them in this paper.
  All the results presented here appear to be effective. In the third paper of this series, joint with S. Oh, we will provide examples confirming the optimality of our results.</description>

Abstract: We develop and implement an algorithm that computes the full knot Floer complex of knots of thickness one. As an application, by extending this algorithm to certain knots of thickness two, we show that all but finitely many non-integral Dehn surgery slopes are characterizing for most knots with up to 17 crossings.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the number of ends of the mapping class group of a stable avenue surface. We prove that the mapping class group is one-ended whenever the stable avenue surface has at least one end of discrete type. Our method is to show that the associated translatable curve graph, which is quasi-isometric to the mapping class group, is one-ended.</description>

      <title>Tropical Dynamics of Markov Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the algebraic dynamics on Markov cubics generated by Vieta involutions, in the tropicalized setting. It turns out that there is an invariant subset of the tropicalized Markov cubic where the action by Vieta involutions can be modeled by that of $(\infty,\infty,\infty)$-triangle reflection group on the hyperbolic plane.
  This understanding of the tropicalized algebraic dynamics produces some results on Markov cubics over non-archimedean fields, including the existence of the Fatou domain and finitude of orbits with rational points having prime power denominators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ that the connected sum of a closed aspherical $n$-manifold with an arbitrary non-compact manifold does not admit a complete metric with nonnegative scalar curvature. In particular, a special case of our result answers a question of Gromov.
  More generally, we generalize the partial classification result of Chodosh, Li, and Liokumovich to the non-compact domination case with our newly-developed technique.
  Our result unifies all previous results of this type, and confirms the validity of Gromov's non-compact domination conjecture for closed aspherical manifolds of dimensions 3, 4, and 5.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type independently by Miyaoka and Yau in 1977. Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study moduli spaces of sextic curves with simple singularities. Through period maps of K3 surfaces with ADE singularities, we prove that such moduli spaces admit algebraic open embeddings into arithmetic quotients of type IV domains. For all cases, we prove the identifications of GIT compactifications and Looijenga compactifications. We also describe Picard lattices in an explicit way for many cases. For nodal cases, we prove that the orbifold structures on the two sides of the period map are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Strongly Doubly Reversible Pairs in Quaternionic Unitary Group of Signature $(n,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\PSp(n,1)$ denote the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$. A pair $(g_1,g_2)$ $\PSp(n,1)$ is \emph{strongly doubly reversible} if $(g_1,g_2)$ and $(g_1^{-1},g_2^{-1})$ are simultaneously conjugate in $\PSp(n,1)$ by an involution. Equivalently, there exist involutions $i_1,i_2,i_3 \in \PSp(n,1)$ such that $g_1 = i_1 i_2$, $g_2 = i_1 i_3$.
  We prove that the set of such pairs has Haar measure zero in $\PSp(n,1) \times \PSp(n,1)$. The same result also holds for $\PSp(n) \times \PSp(n)$ for $n\geq 2$. In the special case $n=1$, we show that every pair of elements in $\PSp(1)$ is strongly doubly reversible. Applying this result, we give a shorter proof of a theorem of Basmajian and Maskit showing that every pair of elements in ${\rm SO}(4)$ is strongly doubly reversible.
  Furthermore, we derive the necessary conditions for a pair of hyperbolic elements in $\PSp(1,1)$ to be strongly doubly reversible and provide a quantitative characterization of such pairs.</description>
