      <title>Cluster formation due to repulsive spanning trees in attractively coupled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of coupled nonlinear oscillators are a popular paradigm and an ideal benchmark for analyzing complex collective behaviors. The onset of cluster synchronization is found to be at the core of various technological and biological processes. The current literature has investigated cluster synchronization by focusing mostly on the case of attractive coupling among the oscillators. However, the case of two coexisting competing interactions is of practical interest due to their relevance in diverse natural settings, including neuronal networks consisting of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the coevolving social model with voters of opposite opinions, ecological plant communities with both facilitation and competition, to name a few. In the present article, we investigate the impact of repulsive spanning trees on cluster formation within a connected network of attractively coupled limit cycle oscillators. We successfully predict which nodes belong to each cluster and the emergent frustration of the connected networks independent of the particular local dynamics at the network nodes. We also determine local asymptotic stability of the cluster states using an approach based on the formulation of a master stability function. We additionally validate the emergence of solitary states and antisynchronization for some specific choices of spanning trees and networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems from the Koopman operator viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently proposed a fully quantum-mechanical definition of the asymptotic phase for quantum nonlinear oscillators, which is also applicable in the strong quantum regime [Kato and Nakao 2022 Chaos 32 063133]. In this study, we propose a definition of the quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems, which extends naturally the definition of the asymptotic amplitude for classical nonlinear oscillators on the basis of the Koopman operator theory. We introduce the asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory systems by using the eigenoperator of the backward Liouville operator associated with the largest non-zero real eigenvalue. Using examples of the quantum van der Pol oscillator with the quantum Kerr effect, exhibiting quantum limit-cycle oscillations, and the quantum van der Pol model with the quantum squeezing and degenerate parametric oscillator with nonlinear damping, exhibiting quantum noise-induced oscillations, we illustrate that the proposed quantum asymptotic amplitude appropriately yields isostable amplitude values that decay exponentially with a constant rate.</description>

      <title>Ghost cycles exhibit increased entrainment and richer dynamics in response to external forcing compared to slow-fast systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural, living and engineered systems display oscillations that are characterized by multiple timescales. Typically, such systems are described as slow-fast systems, where the slow dynamics result from a hyperbolic slow manifold that guides the movement of the system trajectories. Recently, we have provided an alternative description in which the slow dynamics result from a non-hyperbolic and Lyapunov-unstable attracting sets from connected dynamical ghosts that form a closed orbit (termed ghost cycles). Here we investigate the response properties of both type of systems to external forcing. Using the classical Van-der-Pol oscillator and two modified versions of this model that correspond to a 1-ghost and a 2-ghost cycle, respectively, we find that ghost cycles are characterized by significant increase especially in the 1:1 entrainment regions as demonstrated by the corresponding Arnold tongues and exhibit richer dynamics (bursting, chaos) in contrast to the classical slow-fast system. Phase plane analysis reveals that these features result from the continuous remodeling of the attractor landscape of the ghost cycles models characteristic for non-autonomous systems, whereas the attractor landscape of the corresponding slow-fast system remains qualitatively unaltered. We propose that systems containing ghost cycles display increased flexibility and responsiveness to continuous environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Quantized plastic deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to tensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat nature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips, mimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation has recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal plasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also capturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific aspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in its original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity theory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The ensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the quantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described by a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to a considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and efficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed case-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach for the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that the re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of plastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical experiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated with plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a critical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical considerations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics (DDD) simulations.</description>
