      <title>CellMaster: Collaborative Cell Type Annotation in Single-Cell Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) enables atlas-scale profiling of complex tissues, revealing rare lineages and transient states. Yet, assigning biologically valid cell identities remains a bottleneck because markers are tissue- and state-dependent, and novel states lack references. We present CellMaster, an AI agent that mimics expert practice for zero-shot cell-type annotation. Unlike existing automated tools, CellMaster leverages LLM-encoded knowledge (e.g., GPT-4o) to perform on-the-fly annotation with interpretable rationales, without pre-training or fixed marker databases. Across 9 datasets spanning 8 tissues, CellMaster improved accuracy by 7.1% over best-performing baselines (including CellTypist and scTab) in automatic mode. With human-in-the-loop refinement, this advantage increased to 18.6%, with a 22.1% gain on subtype populations. The system demonstrates particular strength in rare and novel cell states where baselines often fail.

      <title>Rawsamble: Overlapping and Assembling Raw Nanopore Signals using a Hash-based Seeding Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raw nanopore signal analysis is a common approach in genomics to provide fast and resource-efficient analysis without translating the signals to bases (i.e., without basecalling). However, existing solutions cannot interpret raw signals directly if a reference genome is unknown due to a lack of accurate mechanisms to handle increased noise in pairwise raw signal comparison. Our goal is to enable the direct analysis of raw signals without a reference genome. To this end, we propose Rawsamble, the first mechanism that can identify regions of similarity between all raw signal pairs, known as all-vs-all overlapping, using a hash-based search mechanism.
  We use these overlaps to construct de novo assembly graphs with an existing assembler, miniasm, off-the-shelf. To our knowledge, these are the first de novo assemblies ever constructed directly from raw signals without basecalling. Our extensive evaluations across multiple genomes of varying sizes show that Rawsamble provides a significant speedup (on average by 5.01x and up to 23.10x) and reduces peak memory usage (on average by 5.74x and up to by 22.00x) compared to a conventional genome assembly pipeline using the state-of-the-art tools for basecalling (Dorado's fastest mode) and overlapping (minimap2) on a CPU.We find that around one-third of Rawsamble 's overlapping pairs are also found by minimap2. We find that when we use overlapping reads from Rawsamble, we can construct unitigs that are 1) as accurate as those built from minimap2's overlaps and 2) up to half a chromosome in length (e.g., 2.3 million bases for E. coli).
