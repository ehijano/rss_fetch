      <title>A High-Power Microwave Limiter Using A Self-Actuated Plasma-Based EIT Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel metamaterial topology incorporating gas discharge tubes for high-power microwave protection. The design features two split ring resonators positioned side by side with their splits oriented orthogonally. When exposed to low-power microwaves, each split ring resonator induces a resonance that interacts to create a passband within a broad stopband, facilitated by a phenomenon known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At high power levels, the integrated gas discharge tubes become ionized, forming plasma that acts as a switch to eliminate the EIT window, thereby reinstating the stopband for protection. Several prototypes have been developed for S-band operation based on this concept. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are in complete agreement. The proposed device demonstrates superior protection with lower insertion loss in the OFF mode and higher isolation in the ON mode. Its strong ability to handle high-power microwaves is achieved using plasma-based switches instead of diodes, providing a reasonable response time and a straightforward design that enables rapid prototyping. Additionally, the device demonstrates frequency and power threshold tunability, highlighting its versatility as a microwave protection device.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Element Model Showing Increased Carrier Mobility in Downscaled Amorphous Semiconductors for Flexible Microprocessors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the carrier mobilities of amorphous semiconductors can be significantly increased through device downscaling without material-level optimization. This is based on a recently published scalable finite-element model for amorphous semiconductors. Using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in an ideal field effect transistor (FET) as an example, the intrinsic DC electron mobility at room temperature is estimated to increase by a factor of at least 8.33 when the channel length is decreased to 10 nm. Keeping a sufficient channel width ensures device-to-device (D2D) uniformity. The simulation is based on the multiple trapping and release (MTR) theory in combination with statistical equivalent analyses. The increased mobility is attributed to the short channel length relative to the characteristic length scale of band fluctuation that is determined by the medium-range order of the material. This paper may inspire the development of next-generation high-density, high-speed, flexible microprocessors based on low-cost amorphous semiconductors for Internet of Things devices.</description>

      <title>External busbars for improving current generation in multijunction solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an improved device fabrication process employed in the development of an advanced front contact grid design employing external busbars. The advanced fabrication process results in enhanced solar cell performance measured at one-sun illumination. In this grid configuration the busbar area is located outside the active solar cell and the grid fingers travel across the mesa sidewalls. With this design the solar cell size can be scaled down without limitations as the area of the busbar is not restricting the component size. Thus, the demonstrated design is beneficial especially for micro-concentrator solar cells. In general, this approach minimizes the power losses originating from the grid shadowing and dark area related voltage losses. The performance of the proposed design is validated by fabricating GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb triple-junction solar cells employing the grid design with external busbars. Light-biased current-voltage and electroluminescence characteristics of the cells reveal that an additional contact GaAs etching step prior to front contact metal deposition is needed to ensure good photovoltaic performance with a fill factor of 85% at one-sun illumination. The improvement is attributed to removing the plasma-damaged material layer that can extend to a depth beyond 100 nm, leading to resistive losses.</description>

      <title>Corner cutting connects chiral colorimetry to net electric flux in lossless all-dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-dielectric metasurfaces can produce structural colors, but the most advantageous design criteria are still being investigated. This work numerically studies how the two-dimensional shape of nanoparticles affects the colorimetric response under circularly polarized light (CPL) to develop a sensor distinguishing CPL orientations. Using lossless dielectric materials (silicon nitride on silicon dioxide), we achieve far-field dichroism by modifying oblong nanoparticles into L-shaped structures through corner cuts. This design suppresses one electric dipole under CPL illumination, leading to differential colorimetric responses. We link these responses to a decoupling effect in the near-field net electric flux. Our findings provide design guidelines for all-dielectric, lossless colorimetric sensors of chiral light.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural Nonlinearity in Binary Polariton-Based Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network's layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network's configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Observing a quantum magnetic effect in CaYAl3O7-X particles (X=Ni, Fe, Co)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yttrium calcium aluminate, with the formula CaYAl3O7, has been extensively researched due to its remarkable luminescent properties when doped or co-doped. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional piezoelectric properties at high temperatures. However, the potential magnetic properties this material can acquire through doping or co-doping have largely gone unexplored until now. In this innovative study, we investigate the quantum magnetic characteristics of yttrium calcium aluminate particles doped with transition metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. Our magnetic measurements of hysteresis curves in the macroscopic regime reveal intriguing magnetic characteristics that have not been documented in the literature. Given the high applicability of this material in biological microelectromechanical systems, we conducted a detailed study to demonstrate these findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide heterostructures provide versatile platforms for manipulating electronic and ionic conductive states. In this study, we demonstrate a remarkable billion-fold enhancement in room-temperature ionic conductivity within h-RMnO3/YSZ heterostructures, achieved through electric-field-assisted oxygen deficiency engineering. This enhancement is closely linked to substantial oxygen depletion in YSZ and is tunable by varying the thickness of the h-RMnO3 film layer and the applied voltage bias. Our findings underscore the critical importance of interfacial design and vacancy control in enhancing ionic transport capabilities, paving the way for advanced applications in low-temperature energy harvesting, storage, and conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>Combining Entangled and Non-Entangled Based Quantum Key Distribution Protocol With GHZ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid Quantum Key Distribution ,QKD, protocol that combines entanglement based and non entanglement based approaches to optimize security and the number of generated keys. We introduce a dynamic system that integrates a three particle GHZ state method with the two state B92 protocol, using a quantum superposition state to probabilistically switch between them. The GHZ state component leverages strong three particle entanglement correlations for enhanced security, while the B92 component offers simplicity and potentially higher key generation rates. Implemented and simulated using Qiskit, our approach demonstrates higher number of generated keys compared to standalone protocols while maintaining robust security. We present a comprehensive analysis of the security properties and performance characteristics of the proposed protocol. The results show that this combined method effectively balances the trade offs inherent in QKD systems, offering a flexible framework adaptable to varying channel conditions and security requirements.This research contributes to ongoing efforts to make QKD more practical and efficient, potentially advancing the development of large scale, secured quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Photonic Matrix Multiplier Makes a Direction-Finding Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a photonic integrated circuit solution for the direction-of-arrival estimation in the optical frequency band. The proposed circuit is built on discrete sampling of the phasefront of an incident optical beam and its analog processing in a photonic matrix-vector multiplier that maps the angle of arrival into the intensity profile at the output ports. We derive conditions for perfect direction-of-arrival sensing for a discrete set of incident angles and its continuous interpolation and discuss the angular resolution and field-of-view of the proposed device in terms of the number of input and output ports of the matrix multiplier. We show that while, in general, a non-unitary matrix operation is required for perfect direction finding, under certain conditions, it can be approximated with a unitary operation that simplifies the device complexity while coming at the cost of reducing the field of view. The proposed device will enable real-time direction-finding sensing through its ultra-compact design and minimal digital signal processing requirements.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Tunable Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Supercrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge that could advance thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that nano- to meso-scale heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises an interesting route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Complex Relationships in Thermoreflectance Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving thermal gradients and solidification velocities during laser melting of a refractory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), can yield high-value parts with unique geometries and features, substantially reducing costs and enhancing performance. However, the material properties from L-PBF processes are highly sensitive to the laser processing conditions and the resulting dynamic temperature fields around the melt pool. In this study, we develop a methodology to measure thermal gradients, cooling rates, and solidification velocities during solidification of refractory alloy C103 using in situ high-speed infrared (IR) imaging with a high frame rate of approximately 15,000 frames per second (fps). Radiation intensity maps are converted to temperature maps by integrating thermal radiation over the wavelength range of the camera detector while also considering signal attenuation caused by optical parts. Using a simple method that assigns the liquidus temperature to the melt pool boundary identified ex situ, a scaling relationship between temperature and the IR signal was obtained. The spatial temperature gradients (dT/dx), heating/cooling rates (dT/dt), and solidification velocities (R) are resolved with sufficient temporal resolution under various laser processing conditions, and the resulting microstructures are analyzed, revealing epitaxial growth and nucleated grain growth. Thermal data shows that a decreasing temperature gradient and increasing solidification velocity from the edge to the center of the melt pool can induce a transition from epitaxial to equiaxed grain morphology, consistent with the previously reported columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) trend. The methodology presented can reduce the uncertainty and variability in AM and guide microstructure control during AM of metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Structure Inverse Design and Optimization Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.02063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From ancient to modern times, acoustic structures have been used to control the propagation of acoustic waves. However, the design of the acoustic structures has remained widely a time-consuming and computational resource-consuming iterative process. In recent years, Deep Learning has attracted unprecedented attention for its ability to tackle hard problems with huge datasets, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks. In this work, an acoustic structure design method is proposed based on deep learning. Taking the design of multi-order Helmholtz resonator for instance, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method is not only able to give a very accurate prediction of the geometry of the acoustic structures with multiple strong-coupling parameters, but also capable of improving the performance of evolutionary approaches in optimization for a desired property. Compared with the conventional numerical methods, our method is more efficient, universal and automatic, which has a wide range of potential applications, such as speech enhancement, sound absorption and insulation.</description>

      <title>Polariton lattices as binarized neuromorphic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Dissipation Nanomechanical Devices from Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of nanomechanical resonators range from from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. Their performance is often is limited by internal material damping, which can be greatly reduced by using crystalline materials. Crystalline silicon carbide is particularly appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but has suffered from high internal damping due to material defects. Here we resolve this by developing nanomechanical resonators fabricated from bulk monocrystalline 4H-silicon carbide. This allows us to achieve damping as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline silicon carbide resonator and corresponding to a quality factor as high as 20 million at room temperature. The volumetric dissipation of our devices reaches the material limit for silicon carbide for the first time. This provides a path to greatly increase the performance of silicon carbide nanomechanical resonators, with potential for quality factors that exceed 10 billion at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Chemically Stable Group IV-V Transition Metal Carbide Thin Films in Hydrogen Radical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is playing a crucial role in the green energy transition. Yet, its tendency to react with and diffuse into surrounding materials poses a challenge. Therefore, it is critical to develop coatings that protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive-hydrogen environments. In this work, we report group IV-V transition metal carbide (TMC) thin films as potential candidates for hydrogen-protective coatings in hydrogen radical (H*) environments at elevated temperatures. We identify three classes of TMCs based on the reduction of carbides and surface oxides (TMOx). HfC, ZrC, TiC, TaC, NbC, and VC (class A) are found to have a stable carbidic-C (TM-C) content, with a further sub-division into partial (class A1: HfC, ZrC, and TiC) and strong (class A2: TaC, NbC, and VC) surface TMOx reduction. In contrast to class A, a strong carbide reduction is observed in Co2C (class B), along with a strong surface TMOx reduction. The H*-TMC/TMOx interaction is hypothesized to entail three processes: (i) hydrogenation of surface C/O-atoms, (ii) formation of CHx/OHx species, and (iii) subsurface C/O-atoms diffusion to the surface vacancies. The number of adsorbed H-atoms required to form CHx/OHx species (i), and the corresponding energy barriers (ii) are estimated based on the change in the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the reduction reactions of TMCs and TMOx. Hydrogenation of surface carbidic-C-atoms is proposed to limit the reduction of TMCs, whereas the reduction of surface TMOx is governed by the thermodynamic barrier for forming H2O.</description>

      <title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: a statistical theory of balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the so-called strong version of structural balance theory, actors in signed social networks avoid establishing triads with an odd number of negative links. Generalising, the weak version of balance theory allows for nodes to be partitioned into any number of blocks with positive internal links, mutually connected by negative links. If this prescription is interpreted rigidly, i.e. without allowing for statistical noise in the observed link signs, then most real graphs will appear to require a larger number of blocks than the actual one, or even to violate both versions of the theory. This might lead to conclusions invoking even more relaxed notions of balance. Here, after rephrasing structural balance theory in statistically testable terms, we propose an inference scheme to unambiguously assess whether a real-world, signed graph is balanced. We find that the proposed statistical balance theory leads to interpretations that are quite different from those derived from the current, deterministic versions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of broadband super-absorption of electromagnetic waves through space-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using time as an additional design parameter in electromagnetism, photonics, and wave physics is attracting considerable research interest, motivated by the possibility to explore physical phenomena and engineering opportunities beyond the physical limits of time-invariant systems. However, despite substantial theoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new effects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of enhanced broadband absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, anti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide new insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption and may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.</description>

      <title>Damage due to Ice Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The freezing of water is one of the major causes of mechanical damage in materials during wintertime; surprisingly this happens even in situations where water only partially saturates the material so that the ice has room to grow. Here we perform freezing experiments in cylindrical glass vials of various sizes and wettability properties, using a dye that exclusively colors the liquid phase; this allows to precisely observe the freezing front. The visualization reveals that damage occurs in partially water-saturated media when a closed liquid inclusion forms within the ice due to the freezing of air/water meniscus. When this water inclusion subsequently freezes, the volume expansion leads to very high pressures leading to the fracture of both the surrounding ice and the glass vial. The pressure can be understood quantitatively based on thermodynamics which correctly predicts that the crystallization pressure is independent of the volume of the liquid pocket. Finally, our results also reveal that by changing the wetting properties of the confining walls, the formation of the liquid pockets that cause the mechanical damage can be avoided.</description>
