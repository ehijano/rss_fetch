      <title>Identification and Estimation of Causal Effects in High-Frequency Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide precise conditions for nonparametric identification of causal effects by high-frequency event study regressions, which have been used widely in the recent macroeconomics, financial economics and political economy literatures. The high-frequency event study method regresses changes in an outcome variable on a measure of unexpected changes in a policy variable in a narrow time window around an event or a policy announcement (e.g., a 30-minute window around an FOMC announcement). We show that, contrary to popular belief, the narrow size of the window is not sufficient for identification. Rather, the population regression coefficient identifies a causal estimand when (i) the effect of the policy shock on the outcome does not depend on the other shocks (separability) and (ii) the surprise component of the news or event dominates all other shocks that are present in the event window (relative exogeneity). Technically, the latter condition requires the policy shock to have infinite variance in the event window. Under these conditions, we establish the causal meaning of the event study estimand corresponding to the regression coefficient and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the event study estimator. Notably, this standard linear regression estimator is robust to general forms of nonlinearity. We apply our results to Nakamura and Steinsson's (2018a) analysis of the real economic effects of monetary policy, providing a simple empirical procedure to analyze the extent to which the standard event study estimator adequately estimates causal effects of interest.</description>

      <title>Testing for Restricted Stochastic Dominance under Survey Nonresponse with Panel Data: Theory and an Evaluation of Poverty in Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper lays the groundwork for a unifying approach to stochastic dominance testing under survey nonresponse that integrates the partial identification approach to incomplete data and design-based inference for complex survey data. We propose a novel inference procedure for restricted $s$th-order stochastic dominance, tailored to accommodate a broad spectrum of nonresponse assumptions. The method uses pseudo-empirical likelihood to formulate the test statistic and compares it to a critical value from the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. We detail the procedure's asymptotic properties under both null and alternative hypotheses, establishing its uniform validity under the null and consistency against various alternatives. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we demonstrate the procedure's utility in a sensitivity analysis of temporal poverty comparisons among Australian households.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>

      <title>F-FOMAML: GNN-Enhanced Meta-Learning for Peak Period Demand Forecasting with Proxy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.</description>

      <title>Difference in Differences with Time-Varying Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers identification and estimation of causal effect parameters from participating in a binary treatment in a difference in differences (DID) setup when the parallel trends assumption holds after conditioning on observed covariates. Relative to existing work in the econometrics literature, we consider the case where the value of covariates can change over time and, potentially, where participating in the treatment can affect the covariates themselves. We propose new empirical strategies in both cases. We also consider two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions that include time-varying regressors, which is the most common way that DID identification strategies are implemented under conditional parallel trends. We show that, even in the case with only two time periods, these TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) time-varying covariates being affected by the treatment, (ii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates in addition to only the change in the covariates over time, (iii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, (iv) treatment effect heterogeneity with respect to observed covariates, and (v) violations of strong functional form assumptions, both for outcomes over time and the propensity score, that are unlikely to be plausible in most DID applications. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases. We propose both doubly robust estimands and regression adjustment/imputation strategies that are robust to these issues while not being substantially more challenging to implement.</description>

      <title>Individual Welfare Analysis: Random Quasilinear Utility, Independence, and Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for individual-level welfare analysis. It builds on a parametric model for continuous demand with a quasilinear utility function, allowing for heterogeneous coefficients and unobserved individual-good-level preference shocks. We obtain bounds on the individual-level consumer welfare loss at any confidence level due to a hypothetical price increase, solving a scalable optimization problem constrained by a novel confidence set under an independence restriction. This confidence set is computationally simple and robust to weak instruments, nonlinearity, and partial identification. The validity of the confidence set is guaranteed by our new results on the joint limiting distribution of the independence test by Chatterjee (2021). These results together with the confidence set may have applications beyond welfare analysis. Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications on gasoline and food demand demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>A joint test of unconfoundedness and common trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an overidentification test of two alternative assumptions to identify the average treatment effect on the treated in a two-period panel data setting: unconfoundedness and common trends. Under the unconfoundedness assumption, treatment assignment and post-treatment outcomes are independent, conditional on control variables and pre-treatment outcomes, which motivates including pre-treatment outcomes in the set of controls. Conversely, under the common trends assumption, the trend and the treatment assignment are independent, conditional on control variables. This motivates employing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach by comparing the differences between pre- and post-treatment outcomes of the treatment and control group. Given the non-nested nature of these assumptions and their often ambiguous plausibility in empirical settings, we propose a joint test using a doubly robust statistic that can be combined with machine learning to control for observed confounders in a data-driven manner. We discuss various causal models that imply the satisfaction of either common trends, unconfoundedness, or both assumptions jointly, and we investigate the finite sample properties of our test through a simulation study. Additionally, we apply the proposed method to five empirical examples using publicly available datasets and find the test to reject the null hypothesis in two cases.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Estimation of Treatment Effects in Observational Studies with Heterogeneous Partial Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many observational studies in social science and medicine, subjects or units are connected, and one unit's treatment and attributes may affect another's treatment and outcome, violating the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) and resulting in interference. To enable feasible estimation and inference, many previous works assume exchangeability of interfering units (neighbors). However, in many applications with distinctive units, interference is heterogeneous and needs to be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we focus on the partial interference setting, and only restrict units to be exchangeable conditional on observable characteristics. Under this framework, we propose generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators for general causal estimands that include heterogeneous direct and spillover effects. We show that they are semiparametric efficient and robust to heterogeneous interference as well as model misspecifications. We apply our methods to the Add Health dataset to study the direct effects of alcohol consumption on academic performance and the spillover effects of parental incarceration on adolescent well-being.</description>
