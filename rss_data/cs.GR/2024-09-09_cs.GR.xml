      <title>PhysHand: A Hand Simulation Model with Physiological Geometry, Physical Deformation, and Accurate Contact Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In virtual Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) scenarios, the authenticity of the hand's deformation is important to immersive experience, such as natural manipulation or tactile feedback. Unrealistic deformation arises from simplified hand geometry, neglect of the different physics attributes of the hand, and penetration due to imprecise contact handling. To address these problems, we propose PhysHand, a novel hand simulation model, which enhances the realism of deformation in HOI. First, we construct a physiologically plausible geometry, a layered mesh with a "skin-flesh-skeleton" structure. Second, to satisfy the distinct physics features of different soft tissues, a constraint-based dynamics framework is adopted with carefully designed layer-corresponding constraints to maintain flesh attached and skin smooth. Finally, we employ an SDF-based method to eliminate the penetration caused by contacts and enhance its accuracy by introducing a novel multi-resolution querying strategy. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of PhysHand in calculating deformations and handling contacts. Compared to existing methods, our PhysHand: 1) can compute both physiologically and physically plausible deformation; 2) significantly reduces the depth and count of penetration in HOI.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fungal Morphology Simulation and Dynamic Light Containment from a Graphics Generation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fungal simulation and control are considered crucial techniques in Bio-Art creation. However, coding algorithms for reliable fungal simulations have posed significant challenges for artists. This study equates fungal morphology simulation to a two-dimensional graphic time-series generation problem. We propose a zero-coding, neural network-driven cellular automaton. Fungal spread patterns are learned through an image segmentation model and a time-series prediction model, which then supervise the training of neural network cells, enabling them to replicate real-world spreading behaviors. We further implemented dynamic containment of fungal boundaries with lasers. Synchronized with the automaton, the fungus successfully spreads into pre-designed complex shapes in reality.</description>

      <title>Holonomy: A Virtual Reality Exploration of Hyperbolic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HOLONOMY is a virtual environment based on the mathematical concept of hyperbolic geometry. Unlike other environments, HOLONOMY allows users to seamlessly explore an infinite hyperbolic space by physically walking. They use their body as the controller, eliminating the need for teleportation or other artificial VR locomotion methods. This paper discusses the development of HOLONOMY, highlighting the technical challenges faced and overcome during its creation, including rendering complex hyperbolic environments, populating the space with objects, and implementing algorithms for finding shortest paths in the underlying non-Euclidean geometry. Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept implementation in the form of a VR navigation game and some preliminary learning outcomes from this implementation.</description>

      <title>Weighted Squared Volume Minimization (WSVM) for Generating Uniform Tetrahedral Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm, Weighted Squared Volume Minimization (WSVM), for generating high-quality tetrahedral meshes from closed triangle meshes. Drawing inspiration from the principle of minimal surfaces that minimize squared surface area, WSVM employs a new energy function integrating weighted squared volumes for tetrahedral elements. When minimized with constant weights, this energy promotes uniform volumes among the tetrahedra. Adjusting the weights to account for local geometry further achieves uniform dihedral angles within the mesh. The algorithm begins with an initial tetrahedral mesh generated via Delaunay tetrahedralization and proceeds by sequentially minimizing volume-oriented and then dihedral angle-oriented energies. At each stage, it alternates between optimizing vertex positions and refining mesh connectivity through the iterative process. The algorithm operates fully automatically and requires no parameter tuning. Evaluations on a variety of 3D models demonstrate that WSVM consistently produces tetrahedral meshes of higher quality, with fewer slivers and enhanced uniformity compared to existing methods.

      <title>Flash Cache: Reducing Bias in Radiance Cache Based Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.</description>

      <title>Fisheye-GS: Lightweight and Extensible Gaussian Splatting Module for Fisheye Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered attention for its high fidelity and real-time rendering. However, adapting 3DGS to different camera models, particularly fisheye lenses, poses challenges due to the unique 3D to 2D projection calculation. Additionally, there are inefficiencies in the tile-based splatting, especially for the extreme curvature and wide field of view of fisheye lenses, which are crucial for its broader real-life applications. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fisheye-GS.This innovative method recalculates the projection transformation and its gradients for fisheye cameras. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated as a module into other efficient 3D rendering methods, emphasizing its extensibility, lightweight nature, and modular design. Since we only modified the projection component, it can also be easily adapted for use with different camera models. Compared to methods that train after undistortion, our approach demonstrates a clear improvement in visual quality.</description>

      <title>DreamMapping: High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation via Variational Distribution Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as a prevalent technique for text-to-3D generation, enabling 3D content creation by distilling view-dependent information from text-to-2D guidance. However, they frequently exhibit shortcomings such as over-saturated color and excess smoothness. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ultron: Enabling Temporal Geometry Compression of 3D Mesh Sequences using Temporal Correspondence and Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of computer vision, dynamic 3D reconstruction techniques have seen significant progress and found applications in various fields. However, these techniques generate large amounts of 3D data sequences, necessitating efficient storage and transmission methods. Existing 3D model compression methods primarily focus on static models and do not consider inter-frame information, limiting their ability to reduce data size. Temporal mesh compression, which has received less attention, often requires all input meshes to have the same topology, a condition rarely met in real-world applications. This research proposes a method to compress mesh sequences with arbitrary topology using temporal correspondence and mesh deformation. The method establishes temporal correspondence between consecutive frames, applies a deformation model to transform the mesh from one frame to subsequent frames, and replaces the original meshes with deformed ones if the quality meets a tolerance threshold. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of compression performance. The contributions of this paper include a geometry and motion-based model for establishing temporal correspondence between meshes, a mesh quality assessment for temporal mesh sequences, an entropy-based encoding and corner table-based method for compressing mesh sequences, and extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. All the code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/lszhuhaichao/ultron.</description>

      <title>Image color consistency in datasets: the Smooth-TPS3D method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image color consistency is the key problem in digital imaging consistency when creating datasets. Here, we propose an improved 3D Thin-Plate Splines (TPS3D) color correction method to be used, in conjunction with color charts (i.e. Macbeth ColorChecker) or other machine-readable patterns, to achieve image consistency by post-processing. Also, we benchmark our method against its former implementation and the alternative methods reported to date with an augmented dataset based on the Gehler's ColorChecker dataset. Benchmark includes how corrected images resemble the ground-truth images and how fast these implementations are. Results demonstrate that the TPS3D is the best candidate to achieve image consistency. Furthermore, our Smooth-TPS3D method shows equivalent results compared to the original method and reduced the 11-15% of ill-conditioned scenarios which the previous method failed to less than 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Smooth-TPS method is 20% faster than the original method. Finally, we discuss how different methods offer different compromises between quality, correction accuracy and computational load.</description>

      <title>PersonaTalk: Bring Attention to Your Persona in Visual Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For audio-driven visual dubbing, it remains a considerable challenge to uphold and highlight speaker's persona while synthesizing accurate lip synchronization. Existing methods fall short of capturing speaker's unique speaking style or preserving facial details. In this paper, we present PersonaTalk, an attention-based two-stage framework, including geometry construction and face rendering, for high-fidelity and personalized visual dubbing. In the first stage, we propose a style-aware audio encoding module that injects speaking style into audio features through a cross-attention layer. The stylized audio features are then used to drive speaker's template geometry to obtain lip-synced geometries. In the second stage, a dual-attention face renderer is introduced to render textures for the target geometries. It consists of two parallel cross-attention layers, namely Lip-Attention and Face-Attention, which respectively sample textures from different reference frames to render the entire face. With our innovative design, intricate facial details can be well preserved. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our advantages over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, lip-sync accuracy and persona preservation. Furthermore, as a person-generic framework, PersonaTalk can achieve competitive performance as state-of-the-art person-specific methods.

      <title>Decoupling Contact for Fine-Grained Motion Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion style transfer changes the style of a motion while retaining its content and is useful in computer animations and games. Contact is an essential component of motion style transfer that should be controlled explicitly in order to express the style vividly while enhancing motion naturalness and quality. However, it is unknown how to decouple and control contact to achieve fine-grained control in motion style transfer. In this paper, we present a novel style transfer method for fine-grained control over contacts while achieving both motion naturalness and spatial-temporal variations of style. Based on our empirical evidence, we propose controlling contact indirectly through the hip velocity, which can be further decomposed into the trajectory and contact timing, respectively. To this end, we propose a new model that explicitly models the correlations between motions and trajectory/contact timing/style, allowing us to decouple and control each separately. Our approach is built around a motion manifold, where hip controls can be easily integrated into a Transformer-based decoder. It is versatile in that it can generate motions directly as well as be used as post-processing for existing methods to improve quality and contact controllability. In addition, we propose a new metric that measures a correlation pattern of motions based on our empirical evidence, aligning well with human perception in terms of motion naturalness. Based on extensive evaluation, our method outperforms existing methods in terms of style expressivity and motion quality.</description>

      <title>PVP-Recon: Progressive View Planning via Warping Consistency for Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit representations have revolutionized dense multi-view surface reconstruction, yet their performance significantly diminishes with sparse input views. A few pioneering works have sought to tackle the challenge of sparse-view reconstruction by leveraging additional geometric priors or multi-scene generalizability. However, they are still hindered by the imperfect choice of input views, using images under empirically determined viewpoints to provide considerable overlap. We propose PVP-Recon, a novel and effective sparse-view surface reconstruction method that progressively plans the next best views to form an optimal set of sparse viewpoints for image capturing. PVP-Recon starts initial surface reconstruction with as few as 3 views and progressively adds new views which are determined based on a novel warping score that reflects the information gain of each newly added view. This progressive view planning progress is interleaved with a neural SDF-based reconstruction module that utilizes multi-resolution hash features, enhanced by a progressive training scheme and a directional Hessian loss. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our framework achieves high-quality reconstruction with a constrained input budget and outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <title>DiffCSG: Differentiable CSG via Rasterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable rendering is a key ingredient for inverse rendering and machine learning, as it allows to optimize scene parameters (shape, materials, lighting) to best fit target images. Differentiable rendering requires that each scene parameter relates to pixel values through differentiable operations. While 3D mesh rendering algorithms have been implemented in a differentiable way, these algorithms do not directly extend to Constructive-Solid-Geometry (CSG), a popular parametric representation of shapes, because the underlying boolean operations are typically performed with complex black-box mesh-processing libraries. We present an algorithm, DiffCSG, to render CSG models in a differentiable manner. Our algorithm builds upon CSG rasterization, which displays the result of boolean operations between primitives without explicitly computing the resulting mesh and, as such, bypasses black-box mesh processing. We describe how to implement CSG rasterization within a differentiable rendering pipeline, taking special care to apply antialiasing along primitive intersections to obtain gradients in such critical areas. Our algorithm is simple and fast, can be easily incorporated into modern machine learning setups, and enables a range of applications for computer-aided design, including direct and image-based editing of CSG primitives.

      <title>Quantum Wave Function Collapse for Procedural Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers exhibit an inherent randomness, so it seems natural to consider them for procedural content generation. In this work, a quantum version of the famous (classical) wave function collapse algorithm is proposed. This quantum wave function collapse algorithm is based on the idea that a quantum circuit can be prepared in such a way that it acts as a special-purpose random generator for content of a desired form. The proposed method is presented theoretically and investigated experimentally on simulators and IBM Quantum devices.</description>

      <title>TOGS: Gaussian Splatting with Temporal Opacity Offset for Real-Time 4D DSA Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (4D DSA) is a medical imaging technique that provides a series of 2D images captured at different stages and angles during the process of contrast agent filling blood vessels. It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting method with opacity offset over time, which can effectively improve the rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for each Gaussian to model the opacity offsets of the Gaussian, using these opacity-varying Gaussians to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth loss term in the loss function to mitigate overfitting issues that may arise in the model when dealing with sparse view scenarios. During the training phase, we randomly prune Gaussians, thereby reducing the storage overhead of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, this model achieves state-of-the-art render quality under the same number of training views. Additionally, it enables real-time rendering while maintaining low storage overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/TOGS.</description>

      <title>NeB-SLAM: Neural Blocks-based Salable RGB-D SLAM for Unknown Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit representations have recently demonstrated considerable potential in the field of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This is due to their inherent advantages, including low storage overhead and representation continuity. However, these methods necessitate the size of the scene as input, which is impractical for unknown scenes. Consequently, we propose NeB-SLAM, a neural block-based scalable RGB-D SLAM for unknown scenes. Specifically, we first propose a divide-and-conquer mapping strategy that represents the entire unknown scene as a set of sub-maps. These sub-maps are a set of neural blocks of fixed size. Then, we introduce an adaptive map growth strategy to achieve adaptive allocation of neural blocks during camera tracking and gradually cover the whole unknown scene. Finally, extensive evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in both mapping and tracking when targeting unknown environments.</description>

      <title>DiffUHaul: A Training-Free Method for Object Dragging in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have proven effective for solving many image editing tasks. However, the seemingly straightforward task of seamlessly relocating objects within a scene remains surprisingly challenging. Existing methods addressing this problem often struggle to function reliably in real-world scenarios due to lacking spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose a training-free method, dubbed DiffUHaul, that harnesses the spatial understanding of a localized text-to-image model, for the object dragging task. Blindly manipulating layout inputs of the localized model tends to cause low editing performance due to the intrinsic entanglement of object representation in the model. To this end, we first apply attention masking in each denoising step to make the generation more disentangled across different objects and adopt the self-attention sharing mechanism to preserve the high-level object appearance. Furthermore, we propose a new diffusion anchoring technique: in the early denoising steps, we interpolate the attention features between source and target images to smoothly fuse new layouts with the original appearance; in the later denoising steps, we pass the localized features from the source images to the interpolated images to retain fine-grained object details. To adapt DiffUHaul to real-image editing, we apply a DDPM self-attention bucketing that can better reconstruct real images with the localized model. Finally, we introduce an automated evaluation pipeline for this task and showcase the efficacy of our method. Our results are reinforced through a user preference study.</description>

      <title>HiSC4D: Human-centered interaction and 4D Scene Capture in Large-scale Space Using Wearable IMUs and LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce HiSC4D, a novel Human-centered interaction and 4D Scene Capture method, aimed at accurately and efficiently creating a dynamic digital world, containing large-scale indoor-outdoor scenes, diverse human motions, rich human-human interactions, and human-environment interactions. By utilizing body-mounted IMUs and a head-mounted LiDAR, HiSC4D can capture egocentric human motions in unconstrained space without the need for external devices and pre-built maps. This affords great flexibility and accessibility for human-centered interaction and 4D scene capturing in various environments. Taking into account that IMUs can capture human spatially unrestricted poses but are prone to drifting for long-period using, and while LiDAR is stable for global localization but rough for local positions and orientations, HiSC4D employs a joint optimization method, harmonizing all sensors and utilizing environment cues, yielding promising results for long-term capture in large scenes. To promote research of egocentric human interaction in large scenes and facilitate downstream tasks, we also present a dataset, containing 8 sequences in 4 large scenes (200 to 5,000 $m^2$), providing 36k frames of accurate 4D human motions with SMPL annotations and dynamic scenes, 31k frames of cropped human point clouds, and scene mesh of the environment. A variety of scenarios, such as the basketball gym and commercial street, alongside challenging human motions, such as daily greeting, one-on-one basketball playing, and tour guiding, demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of HiSC4D. The dataset and code will be publicated on www.lidarhumanmotion.net/hisc4d available for research purposes.</description>
