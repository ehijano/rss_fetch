      <title>An Efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for Learning Physical Dynamics with Manifolds Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient physical simulations are essential in science and engineering, yet traditional numerical solvers face significant challenges in computational cost when handling simulations across dynamic scenarios involving complex geometries, varying boundary/initial conditions, and diverse physical parameters. While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Planning and Machine-Level Scheduling for High-Mix Discrete Manufacturing: A Profit-Driven Heuristic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern manufacturing enterprises struggle to create efficient and reliable production schedules under multi-variety, small-batch, and rush-order conditions. High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers. These results show that aligning planning decisions with stability-oriented execution rules enables practical and interpretable profit-maximizing decisions in complex manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Crop Planning under Uncertainty: Aligning Economic Optimality with Agronomic Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon agricultural planning requires optimizing crop allocation under complex spatial heterogeneity, temporal agronomic dependencies, and multi-source environmental uncertainty. Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability. These results highlight the importance of explicitly encoding domain-specific structural priors into optimization models for resilient decision-making in complex agricultural systems.</description>

      <title>HypeR Adaptivity: Joint $hr$-Adaptive Meshing via Hypergraph Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement is central to the efficient solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) via the finite element method (FEM). Classical $r$-adaptivity optimizes vertex positions but requires solving expensive auxiliary PDEs such as the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, while classical $h$-adaptivity modifies topology through element subdivision but suffers from expensive error indicator computation and is constrained by isotropic refinement patterns that impose accuracy ceilings. Combined $hr$-adaptive techniques naturally outperform single-modality approaches, yet inherit both computational bottlenecks and the restricted cost-accuracy trade-off. Emerging machine learning methods for adaptive mesh refinement seek to overcome these limitations, but existing approaches address $h$-adaptivity or $r$-adaptivity in isolation. We present HypeR, a deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes mesh relocation and refinement. HypeR casts the joint adaptation problem using tools from hypergraph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Refinement is formulated as a heterogeneous multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) where element agents decide discrete refinement actions, while relocation follows an anisotropic diffusion-based policy on vertex agents with provable prevention of mesh tangling. The reward function combines local and global error reduction to promote general accuracy. Across benchmark PDEs, HypeR reduces approximation error by up to 6--10$\times$ versus state-of-art $h$-adaptive baselines at comparable element counts, breaking through the uniform refinement accuracy ceiling that constrains subdivision-only methods. The framework produces meshes with improved shape metrics and alignment to solution anisotropy, demonstrating that jointly learned $hr$-adaptivity strategies can substantially enhance the capabilities of automated mesh generation.</description>

      <title>DynaMate: An Autonomous Agent for Protein-Ligand Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.</description>

      <title>MULE - A Co-Generation Fission Power Plant Concept to Support Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sustained human presence on the Moon, robust in-situ resource utilisation supply chains to provide consumables and propellant are necessary. A promising process is molten salt electrolysis, which typically requires temperatures in excess of 900{\deg}C. Fission reactors do not depend on solar irradiance and are thus well suited for power generation on the Moon, especially during the 14-day lunar night. As of now, fission reactors have only been considered for electric power generation, but the reactor coolant could also be used directly to heat those processes to their required temperatures. In this work, a concept for a co-generation fission power plant on the Moon that can directly heat a MSE plant to the required temperatures and provide a surplus of electrical energy for the lunar base is presented. The neutron transport code Serpent 2 is used to model a ceramic core, gas-cooled very-high-temperature microreactor design and estimate its lifetime with a burnup simulation in hot conditions with an integrated step-wise criticality search. Calculations show a neutronically feasible operation time of at least 10 years at 100kW thermal power. The obtained power distributions lay a basis for further thermal-hydraulic studies on the technical feasibility of the reactor design and the power plant.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Learning of Flow Distribution and Receiver Heat Losses in Parabolic Trough Solar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $&lt;2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Simulating Creep Buckling in Growing Viscoelastic Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling viscoelastic behavior is crucial in engineering and biomechanics, where materials undergo time-dependent deformations, including stress relaxation, creep buckling and biological tissue development. Traditional numerical methods, like the finite element method, often require explicit meshing, artificial perturbations or embedding customised programs to capture these phenomena, adding computational complexity. In this study, we develop an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework using an incremental approach to model viscoelastic creep, stress relaxation, buckling, and growth-induced morphogenesis. Physics consistency is ensured by training neural networks to minimize the systems potential energy functional, implicitly satisfying equilibrium and constitutive laws. We demonstrate that this framework can naturally capture creep buckling without pre-imposed imperfections, leveraging inherent training dynamics to trigger instabilities. Furthermore, we extend our framework to biological tissue growth and morphogenesis, predicting both uniform expansion and differential growth-induced buckling in cylindrical structures. Results show that the energy-based PINN effectively predicts viscoelastic instabilities, post-buckling evolution and tissue morphological evolution, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. This study demonstrates that PINN can be a flexible robust tool for modeling complex, time-dependent material behavior, opening possible applications in structural engineering, soft materials, and tissue development.</description>
