      <title>On reversible and reversible-complementary DNA codes over $\mathbb{F}_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method to construct and count all the linear codes (of arbitrary length) in $\mathbb{F}_{4}$ that are invariant under reverse permutation and that contain the repetition code is presented. These codes are suitable for constructing DNA codes that satisfy the reverse and reverse-complement constraints. By analyzing a module-theoretic structure of these codes, their generating matrices are characterized in terms of their isomorphism type, and explicit formulas for counting them are provided. The proposed construction method based on this characterization outperforms the one given by Abualrub et al. for cyclic codes (of odd length) over $\mathbb{F}_{4}$, and the counting method solves a problem that can not be solved using the one given by Fripertinger for invariant subspaces under a linear endomorphism of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. Additionally, several upper bounds and an identity for the minimum Hamming distance of certain reversible codes are provided.</description>

      <title>Poset-Markov Channels: Capacity via Group Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing channel capacity is in general intractable because it is given by the limit of a sequence of optimization problems whose dimensionality grows to infinity. As a result, constant-sized characterizations of feedback or non-feedback capacity are known for only a few classes of channels with memory. This paper introduces poset-causal channels$\unicode{x2014}$a new formalism of a communication channel in which channel inputs and outputs are indexed by the elements of a partially ordered set (poset). We develop a novel methodology that allows us to establish a single-letter upper bound on the feedback capacity of a subclass of poset-causal channels whose memory structure exhibits a Markov property and symmetry. The methodology is based on symmetry reduction in optimization. We instantiate our method on two channel models: the Noisy Output is The STate (NOST) channel$\unicode{x2014}$for which the bound is tight$\unicode{x2014}$and a new two-dimensional extension of it.</description>

      <title>Two classes of NMDS codes from Roth-Lempel codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes have good algebraic properties and excellent error-correcting capabilities, they have been widely used in various fields such as communication systems, data storage, quantum codes, and so on. In this paper, basing on the generator matrix of Roth-Lempel codes, we present
  two classes of NMDS codes which generalize Han's and Zheng's constructions in 2023 and 2025, respectively. And we also completely determine their weight
  distributions.</description>

      <title>Can Movable Antenna-enabled Micro-Mobility Replace UAV-enabled Macro-Mobility? A Physical Layer Security Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antenna (MA)-enabled micro-mobility to replace UAV-enabled macro-mobility for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in air-to-ground communications. While UAV trajectory optimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it suffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory optimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial reconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low energy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel manipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these paradigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted uniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential information to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems for both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna positions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2) UAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF vectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct operational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages in low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its energy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under resource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by leveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the complementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro mobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency, and deployment complexity in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Robust and Resilient Networks with Integrated Sensing, Communication and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as networked robotics, intelligent transportation, smart factories, and virtual and augmented reality demand integrated perception and connectivity enabled by wireless communication. This has driven growing interests in integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) systems, with a primary focus on their efficient co-designs. However, as ISCC systems increasingly support critical applications, they must not only deliver high performance but also demonstrate robustness and resilience. In this context, robustness refers to a system's ability to maintain performance under uncertainties, while resilience denotes its capacity to sustain a minimum level of service in the face of major disruptions. To address this gap, this article presents an overview of ISCC systems from the perspectives of robustness and resilience under limited resources. First, key concepts related to these properties are introduced in the ISCC context. Subsequently, design approaches for realizing robust and resilient ISCC networks are discussed. Finally, the article concludes with the discussions of a case study and open research problems in this area.</description>

      <title>Balanced Boolean functions with few-valued Walsh spectra parameterized by $P(x^2+x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean functions with few-valued spectra have wide applications in cryptography, coding theory, sequence designs, etc. In this paper, we further study the parametric construction approach to obtain balanced Boolean functions using $2$-to-$1$ mappings of the form $P(x^2+x)$, where $P$ denotes carefully selected permutation polynomials. The key contributions of this work are twofold: (1) We establish a new family of four-valued spectrum Boolean functions. This family includes Boolean functions with good cryptographic properties, e.g., the same nonlinearity as semi-bent functions, the maximal algebraic degree, and the optimal algebraic immunity for dimensions $n \leq 14$. (2) We derive seven distinct classes of plateaued functions, including four infinite families of semi-bent functions and a class of near-bent functions.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Interferometric Protocol Using Spin-Dependent Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum interferometric protocol that leverages spin-dependent spatial displacements to enable high-precision parameter estimation beyond classical limits. By inducing a unitary coupling between a particles spin degree of freedom and its momentum, the protocol generates entanglement between spin states and spatial positions, resulting in coherent spatial superpositions. Interferometric reconstruction of the resulting phase differences enables Heisenberg limited sensitivity for parameters encoded in the spin Hamiltonian. As a concrete application, we demonstrate the protocols effectiveness in magnetic field sensing, where the field is transduced into spatial interference fringes. Quantum Fisher information analysis confirms sub-shot-noise scaling, and the protocol's feasibility is discussed for physical platforms including ultracold atoms and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. Our framework provides a versatile approach to quantum metrology with potential extensions to multiparameter sensing and gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>On the Age of Information in Single-Server Queues with Aged Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that quantifies the freshness of data in systems where timely updates are critical. Most state-of-the-art methods typically assume that packets enter the monitored system with zero age, neglecting situations, such as those prevalent in multi-hop networks or distributed sensing, where packets experience prior delays. In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero initial age. We derive an expression for the average AoI in this setting, showing that it equals the standard AoI plus a correction term involving the correlation between packet age and inter-departure times. When these variables are independent, the expression simplifies to an additive correction equal to the mean initial age. In cases where the dependency structure is unknown, we also establish lower and upper bounds for the correction term. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across various queueing scenarios, such as forwarding, tandem, and retrial queues. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of the derived bounds on a tandem composed of several queues, a model that has not yet been analytically solved from an age perspective.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of OAMP Detection for ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards future 6G wireless networks, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been widely considered as a promising component to enhance the terrestrial communications. To ensure the link reliability of high-mobility satellite communication scenarios, the emerging orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has attracted significant research attention. In this paper, we study the diversity gain achieved by ODDM modulation along with the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Additionally, we propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm based detector to harvest the diversity gain promised by ODDM modulation. By operating the linear and non-linear estimator iteratively, the orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) detector can utilize the sparsity of the effective delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel and extract the full diversity. Simulation results reveal the relationship between diversity gain and system parameters, and demonstrate that our proposed detector can achieve better performance than the conventional message passing methods with significantly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>The Voronoi Spherical CDF for Lattices and Linear Codes: New Bounds for Quantization and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound and immediately translate to improved upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as improved upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel.</description>

      <title>p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores. Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.</description>

      <title>SIM-Enabled Hybrid Digital-Wave Beamforming for Fronthaul-Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays (LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover, the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in most simulated cases, except in the downlink at low signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Fully lifted \emph{blirp} interpolation -- a large deviation view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [104] introduced a powerful \emph{fully lifted} (fl) statistical interpolating mechanism. It established a nested connection between blirps (bilinearly indexed random processes) and their decoupled (linearly indexed) comparative counterparts. We here revisit the comparison from [104] and introduce its a \emph{large deviation} upgrade. The new machinery allows to substantially widen the [104]'s range of applicability. In addition to \emph{typical}, studying analytically much harder \emph{atypical} random structures features is now possible as well. To give a bit of a practical flavor, we show how the obtained results connect to the so-called \emph{local entropies} (LE) and their predicated role in understanding solutions clustering and associated \emph{computational gaps} in hard random optimization problems. As was the case in [104], even though the technical considerations often appear as fairly involved, the final interpolating forms admit elegant expressions thereby providing a relatively easy to use tool readily available for further studies. Moreover, as the considered models encompass all well known random structures discussed in [104], the obtained results automatically apply to them as well.</description>

      <title>A large deviation view of \emph{stationarized} fully lifted blirp interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider \emph{bilinearly indexed random processes} (blirp) and study their interpolating comparative mechanisms. Generic introduction of the \emph{fully lifted} (fl) blirp interpolation in [105] was followed by a corresponding stationarization counterpart in [103]. A \emph{large deviation} upgrade of [105] introduced in companion paper [106] is complemented here with the corresponding one of [103]. Similarly to [106], the mechanism that we introduce extends the range of [103]'s applicability so that it encompasses random structures \emph{atypical} features. Among others these include the \emph{local entropies} (LE) which explain atypical solutions clusterings in hard random optimization problems believed to be directly responsible for the presumable existence of the so-called \emph{computational gaps}. Moreover (and similar to [105]), despite on occasion somewhat involved technical considerations, the final forms of the uncovered fundamental interpolating parameters relations are rather elegant and as such provide a valuable tool readily available for further use.</description>

      <title>Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated \emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness. Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance (\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade, sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly and independently alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the boresight directions of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal boresight directions of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain than the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multipath channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is proposed to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly improve the communication performance as compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights such as the optimal choice of multiple access scheme.</description>

      <title>$(\ell,\delta)$-Diversity: Linkage-Robustness via a Composition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of degradation of anonymity upon linkages of anonymized datasets. We work in the setting where an adversary links together $t\geq 2$ anonymized datasets in which a user of interest participates, based on the user's known quasi-identifiers, which motivates the use of $\ell$-diversity as the notion of dataset anonymity. We first argue that in the worst case, such linkage attacks can reveal the exact sensitive attribute of the user, even when each dataset respects $\ell$-diversity, for moderately large values of $\ell$. This issue motivates our definition of (approximate) $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity -- a parallel of (approximate) $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) -- which simply requires that a dataset respect $\ell$-diversity, with high probability. We then present a mechanism for achieving $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, in the setting of independent and identically distributed samples. Next, we establish bounds on the degradation of $(\ell,\delta)$-diversity, via a simple ``composition theorem,'' similar in spirit to those in the DP literature, thereby showing that approximate diversity, unlike standard diversity, is roughly preserved upon linkage. Finally, we describe simple algorithms for maximizing utility, measured in terms of the number of anonymized ``equivalence classes,'' and derive explicit lower bounds on the utility, for special sample distributions.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Proofs for Diffusion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an elementary, self-contained analysis of diffusion-based sampling methods for generative modeling. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on continuous-time processes and then discretize, our treatment works directly with discrete-time stochastic processes and yields precise non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under broad assumptions. The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution. Our results also provide a transparent view on how to accelerate convergence by using additional randomness in each step to match higher-order moments in the comparison process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>

      <title>Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.</description>
