      <title>Dileptons at Colliders as Probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are used to create a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), similar to the matter in the early universe. Dileptons are a unique probe of the QGP. Being emitted during all stages of the collision without interacting strongly with the surrounding matter, they carry undistorted information about the medium evolution. The mass of the lepton-antilepton pair gives a unique mean to separate partonic from hadronic radiation. Thus, dileptons can be used to study the QGP equilibration time, its average temperature but also effects related to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the hot medium via vector meson decays. This information is not accessible with hadrons. The price to pay is a large background from ordinary hadron decays. We summarize the potential of dilepton measurements, the results obtained so far at colliders, and the ongoing efforts for future experiments with further increased sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: radius effects in the angular substructure of heavy-ion jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure observables serve as essential tools for probing the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and $E$-scheme axes $\langle \phi \rangle$, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as $(R_L/R)^4$, whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as $(R_L/R)^2$ and $(R_L/R)^4$. Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the $\langle \phi \rangle$ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators.</description>

      <title>Identifying Neutron Sources using Recoil and Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($&gt;\!\!4\sigma$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of the in-medium cross section on cluster spectra in ${}^{40,48}\mathrm{Ca}+{}^{58,64}\mathrm{Ni}$ collisions at $56$ and $140$ $\mathbf{\mathrm{MeV}}/\mathrm{\mathbf{nucleon}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although significant efforts have been made to investigate the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, the influence of the in-medium cross section on particle production in transport models is not well constrained. The in-medium cross section reflects the dynamic situation of the medium such as a nontrivial phase space distribution. In this study, we analyze the transverse momentum spectra of $p$, $d$, $t$, ${}^3{\mathrm{He}}$ and $\alpha$ particles emitted near mid-rapidity in central $^{40,48}\mathrm{Ca}$ + $^{58, 64}\mathrm{Ni}$ reactions at $56$ and $140$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$. The Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics ($\mathrm{AMD}$) model is chosen as the transport model for data comparison. Central events are selected based on charged-particle multiplicity in both the experimental data and AMD calculations after applying an experimental filter. Our results show that the in-medium nucleon-nucleon scattering cross-sections are more strongly reduced at $56$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$ than at $140$ $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{nucleon}$ incident energy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations across momentum scales in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions span a broad range in momentum scale: low transverse momentum (low $p_T$) measurements probe collective dynamics, while high $p_T$ measurements probe the response to QGP excitation by jets (jet quenching). However, the dynamical interplay between QGP collective dynamics and jet quenching is currently poorly understood. We present a new framework for exploring dynamical correlations across momentum scales in heavy-ion collisions, based on the $p_T$-differential radial-flow observable $v_0(p_T)$. Measured $v_0(p_T)$ phenomenology is traced to the evolution in strength and coherence of distinct underlying fluctuation modes. We then propose new experimental observables to quantify this evolution. The eigenvalue ratio $\lambda_2/\lambda_1$ of the reference-aligned covariance matrix $V_0$ is shown to measure the effective fluctuation rank, while the $p_T$-dependence of the corresponding eigenvectors maps the evolution from a single coherent soft mode to multi-mode dynamics including coalescence and jet quenching. These observables map the soft-mid-hard correlation structure and provide a unified description of the collective-to-partonic transition in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Three-body resonances of $\alpha\alpha M$ clusters ($M=\phi$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c$) in $^{9}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently obtained HAL QCD potentials for the $N$-$\phi$, $N$-$J/\psi$, and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions. interactions, we investigate the structure of the exotic nuclei $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}$, $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$, and $^{9}_{\eta_c}{\mathrm{Be}}$ as $\alpha+\alpha+M$ three-body systems ($M$ denotes the meson). The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $\alpha\phi$ and $\alpha$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $\phi$ meson exhibits a strong "glue-like" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $\alpha$-$J/\psi$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $\alpha$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems.</description>

      <title>First Study of the Nuclear Response to Fast Hadrons via Angular Correlations between Pions and Slow Protons in Electron-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first measurement of angular correlations between high-energy pions and slow protons in electron-nucleus ($eA$) scattering, providing a new probe of how a nucleus responds to a fast-moving quark. The experiment employed the CLAS detector with a 5-GeV electron beam incident on deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead targets. For heavier nuclei, the pion-proton correlation function is more spread-out in azimuth than for lighter ones, and this effect is more pronounced in the $\pi p$ channel than in earlier $\pi\pi$ studies. The proton-to-pion yield ratio likewise rises with nuclear mass, although the increase appears to saturate for the heaviest targets. These trends are qualitatively reproduced by state-of-the-art $eA$ event generators, including BeAGLE, eHIJING, and GiBUU, indicating that current descriptions of target fragmentation rest on sound theoretical footing. At the same time, the precision of our data exposes model-dependent discrepancies, delineating a clear path for future improvements in the treatment of cold-nuclear matter effects in $eA$ scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dibaryons provide insight into the strong interaction beyond conventional hadrons. Strange dibaryons, containing strange quarks, are especially valuable for probing hyperon-nucleon (YN) and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions. We report measurements of $p$-$\Xi^-$ and $p$-$\Omega^-$ correlation functions in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. The analysis, using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism, yields scattering parameters that offer key implications for the possible formation of strange dibaryon bound states, particularly $H$ ($S = -2$) and $N\Omega$ ($S = -3$).</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>Charting the Luminosity Capabilities of the CERN Large Hadron Collider with Various Nuclear Species</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>
