      <title>Inventory problems and the parametric measure $m_{\lambda}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The credibility theory was introduced by B. Liu as a new way to describe the fuzzy uncertainty. The credibility measure is the fundamental notion of the credibility theory. Recently, L.Yang and K. Iwamura extended the credibility measure by defining the parametric measure $m_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ is a real parameter in the interval $[0,1]$ and for $\lambda= 1/2$ we obtain as a particular case the notion of credibility measure). By using the $m_{\lambda}$-measure, we studied in this paper a risk neutral multi-item inventory problem. Our construction generalizes the credibilistic inventory model developed by Y. Li and Y. Liu in 2019. In our model, the components of demand vector are fuzzy variables and the maximization problem is formulated by using the notion of $m_{\lambda}$-expected value. We shall prove a general formula for the solution of optimization problem, from which we obtained effective formulas for computing the optimal solutions in the particular cases where the demands are trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers. For $\lambda=1/2$ we obtain as a particular case the computation formulas of the optimal solutions of the credibilistic inventory problem of Li and Liu. These computation formulas are applied for some $m_{\lambda}$-models obtained from numerical data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Gaussian Strategies for Vector-valued Witsenhausen Counterexample with Non-causal State Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a vector-valued Witsenhausen model where the second decision maker (DM) acquires a vector of observations before selecting a vector of estimations. Here, the first DM acts causally whereas the second DM estimates non-causally. When the vector length grows, we characterize, via a single-letter expression, the optimal trade-off between the power cost at the first DM and the estimation cost at the second DM. In this paper, we show that the best linear scheme is achieved by using the time-sharing method between two affine strategies, which coincides with the convex envelope of the solution of Witsenhausen in 1968. Here also, Witsenhausen's two-point strategy and the scheme of Grover and Sahai in 2010 where both devices operate non-causally, outperform our best linear scheme. Therefore, gains obtained with block-coding schemes are only attainable if all DMs operate non-causally.</description>

      <title>Positive Dynamic Programming: A Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article Positive Dynamic Programming, David Blackwell tries to answer the question concerning the existence of optimal stationary strategies for a positive dynamic programming problem. The principal results obtained in the paper are indicative of the existence of weakly optimal stationary plans where the optimal return need not be Borel measurable. More specifically, the main theorem establishes the condition for the weakly optimal stationary plan when the optimal return is bounded. Blackwell also gives an example that demonstrates that no optimal plan exists showing that the results obtained in his earlier work on discounted dynamic programming, cannot be generally extended to the positive case.</description>

      <title>On Continuous Terminal Embeddings of Sets of Positive Reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of H\"{o}lder continuous terminal embeddings of any desired $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ with $m=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\omega(S_X)^2)$, for arbitrarily small distortion $\varepsilon$, where $\omega(S_X)$ denotes the Gaussian width of the unit secants of $X$. More specifically, when $X$ is a finite set we provide terminal embeddings that are locally $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"{o}lder almost everywhere, and when $X$ is infinite with positive reach we give terminal embeddings that are locally $\frac{1}{4}$-H\"{o}lder everywhere sufficiently close to $X$ (i.e., within all tubes around $X$ of radius less than $X$'s reach). When $X$ is a compact $d$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^N$, an application of our main results provides terminal embeddings into $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$-dimensional space that are locally H\"{o}lder everywhere sufficiently close to the manifold.</description>

      <title>Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods for risk-averse stochastic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish epigraphical and uniform laws of large numbers for sample-based approximations of law invariant risk functionals. These sample-based approximation schemes include Monte Carlo (MC) and certain randomized quasi-Monte Carlo integration (RQMC) methods, such as scrambled net integration. Our results can be applied to the approximation of risk-averse stochastic programs and risk-averse stochastic variational inequalities. Our numerical simulations empirically demonstrate that RQMC approaches based on scrambled Sobol' sequences can yield smaller bias and root mean square error than MC methods for risk-averse optimization.</description>

      <title>Discrete approximations and optimality conditions for integro-differential inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a new class of generalized Bolza problems governed by nonconvex integro-differential inclusions with endpoint constraints on trajectories, where the integral terms are given in the general (with time-dependent integrands in the dynamics) Volterra form. We pursue here a threefold goal. First we construct well-posed approximations of continuous-time integro-differential systems by their discrete-time counterparts with showing that any feasible solution to the original system can be strongly approximated in the $W^{1,2}$-norm topology by piecewise-linear extensions of feasible discrete trajectories. This allows us to verify in turn the strong convergence of discrete optimal solutions to a prescribed local minimizer for the original problem. Facing intrinsic nonsmoothness of original integro-differential problem and its discrete approximations, we employ appropriate tools of generalized differentiation in variational analysis to derive necessary optimality conditions for discrete-time problems (which is our second goal) and finally accomplish our third goal to obtain necessary conditions for the original continuous-time problems by passing to the limit from discrete approximations. In this way we establish, in particular, a novel necessary optimality condition of the Volterra type, which is the crucial result for dynamic optimization of integro-differential inclusions.</description>

      <title>Viability for locally monotone evolution inclusions and lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for viability of evolution inclusions with locally monotone operators in the sense of Liu and R\"ockner [J. Funct. Anal., 259 (2010), pp. 2902-2922]. This allows us to prove wellposedness of lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the optimal control of evolution inclusions. Thereby, we generalize results in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (2018), pp. 2096-2161] on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions with monotone operators in several ways. First, we permit locally monotone operators. This extends the applicability of our theory to a wider class of equations such as Burgers' equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Second, we allow state constraints. Third, we have uniqueness of viscosity solutions. Our results on viability and lower semicontinuous solutions are new even in the case of monotone operators.</description>

      <title>Competitive Facility Location under Cross-Nested Logit Customer Choice Model: Hardness and Exact Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the competitive facility location problem, where a firm aims to establish new facilities in a market already occupied by competitors. In this problem, customer behavior is crucial for making optimal location decisions. We explore a general class of customer choice models, known as the cross-nested logit (CNL) model, which is recognized for its flexibility and generality in predicting people's choice behavior. To explore the problem, we first demonstrate that it is NP-hard, even when there is only one customer class. We further show that this hardness result is tight, as the facility location problem under any simpler choice models (such as the logit or nested logit) is polynomial-time solvable when there is one customer class. To tackle the resulting facility location problem, we demonstrate that the objective function under a general cross-nested structure is not concave. Interestingly, we show that by a change of variables, the objective function can be converted to a convex program (i.e., a maximization problem with a concave objective and convex constraints), enabling it to be solved to optimality via an outer-approximation algorithm. Extensive experiments show the efficiency of our approach and provide analyses on the benefits of using the cross-nested model in the facility location context.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Analysis of Controllability Scores and Their Application to Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing centrality in network systems is critical for understanding node importance and guiding decision-making processes. In dynamic networks, incorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key nodes. This paper focuses on the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and Average Energy Controllability Score (AECS) as centrality measures for selecting control nodes in linear dynamical network systems. We prove the uniqueness of VCS and AECS for any linear time-invariant system, enhancing their applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility across different researchers. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS in linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices. Moreover, numerical experiments using real-world data indicate that VCS and AECS assessments in brain networks, modeled as Laplacian dynamics, exhibit contrasting trends.</description>

      <title>A Course in Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes are derived from a graduate-level course in dynamic optimization, offering an introduction to techniques and models extensively used in management science, economics, operations research, engineering, and computer science. The course emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings of discrete-time dynamic programming models and advanced algorithmic strategies for solving these models. Unlike typical treatments, it provides a proof for the principle of optimality for upper semi-continuous dynamic programming, a middle ground between the simpler countable state space case \cite{bertsekas2012dynamic}, and the involved universally measurable case \cite{bertsekas1996stochastic}. This approach is sufficiently rigorous to include important examples such as dynamic pricing, consumption-savings, and inventory management models. The course also delves into the properties of value and policy functions, leveraging classical results \cite{topkis1998supermodularity} and recent developments. Additionally, it offers an introduction to reinforcement learning, including a formal proof of the convergence of Q-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the notes delve into policy gradient methods for the average reward case, presenting a convergence result for the tabular case in this context. This result is simple and similar to the discounted case but appears to be new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability of forward and backward stochastic semilinear complex Ginzburg-Landau equations with global Lipschitz nonlinear terms. For this purpose, by deriving an improved global Carleman estimates for linear systems, we obtain the controllability results for the stochastic linear systems with a $L^2$-valued source term. Based on it, together with a Banach fixed point argument, the desired null controllability of semilinear systems is derived.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions for Stochastic Line Search Based Optimization of Over-parametrized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with algorithms to solve the finite-sum problems related to fitting over-parametrized models, that typically satisfy the interpolation condition. In particular, we focus on approaches based on stochastic line searches and employing general search directions. We define conditions on the sequence of search directions that guarantee finite termination and bounds for the backtracking procedure. Moreover, we shed light on the additional property of directions needed to prove fast (linear) convergence of the general class of algorithms when applied to PL functions in the interpolation regime. From the point of view of algorithms design, the proposed analysis identifies safeguarding conditions that could be employed in relevant algorithmic framework. In particular, it could be of interest to integrate stochastic line searches within momentum, conjugate gradient or adaptive preconditioning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03258v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many industries widely adopted hub networks these days. Managing logistics, transportation, and distribution requires a delicate balance to ensure seamless operations within this network. Hub network promotes cost-effective routing through inter-hub flows. Failure of such hubs may impact the total network with huge costs. In this paper, we study bilevel $q$-allocation hub interdiction problem. In previous literature hub interdiction problem was studied with single and multiple allocation protocols.This problem focus on $q$ allocation which solves single and multiple allocation problem as special case. We also show improvements on the branch and cut approach by using cutting planes.Our experiments based on large instances present the efficiency of the approach to solve some previously unsolved instances.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of stochastic gradient method with independent sequences of step-size and momentum weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-scale learning algorithms, the momentum term is usually included in the stochastic sub-gradient method to improve the learning speed because it can navigate ravines efficiently to reach a local minimum. However, step-size and momentum weight hyper-parameters must be appropriately tuned to optimize convergence. We thus analyze the convergence rate using stochastic programming with Polyak's acceleration of two commonly used step-size learning rates: ``diminishing-to-zero" and ``constant-and-drop" (where the sequence is divided into stages and a constant step-size is applied at each stage) under strongly convex functions over a compact convex set with bounded sub-gradients. For the former, we show that the convergence rate can be written as a product of exponential in step-size and polynomial in momentum weight. Our analysis justifies the convergence of using the default momentum weight setting and the diminishing-to-zero step-size sequence in large-scale machine learning software. For the latter, we present the condition for the momentum weight sequence to converge at each stage.</description>

      <title>Randomized Transport Plans via Hierarchical Fully Probabilistic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optimal randomized strategy for design of balanced, normalized mass transport plans is developed. It replaces -- but specializes to -- the deterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a certainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore uncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore, hierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal hyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent with prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This Bayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call HFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the generation of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized marginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent measures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in algorithmic fairness is outlined, where HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a more diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into the delivery of an expected plan. Also, it permits fairness proxies to be endowed with uncertainty quantifiers.</description>

      <title>DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace predictors to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with distributional uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainties. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Sparse Deep Learning Models with the $\ell_1$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse neural networks are highly desirable in deep learning in reducing its complexity. The goal of this paper is to study how choices of regularization parameters influence the sparsity level of learned neural networks. We first derive the $\ell_1$-norm sparsity-promoting deep learning models including single and multiple regularization parameters models, from a statistical viewpoint. We then characterize the sparsity level of a regularized neural network in terms of the choice of the regularization parameters. Based on the characterizations, we develop iterative algorithms for selecting regularization parameters so that the weight parameters of the resulting deep neural network enjoy prescribed sparsity levels. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in choosing desirable regularization parameters and obtaining corresponding neural networks having both of predetermined sparsity levels and satisfactory approximation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of a Multi-Population Mean Field Games with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results on convex subsets of Euclidean spaces invariant under an orthogonal group action. First, we show that invariant spectrahedra admit an equivariant spectrahedral description, i.e., can be described by an equivariant linear matrix inequality. Second, we show that the bijection induced by Kostant's Convexity Theorem between convex subsets invariant under a polar representation and convex subsets of a section invariant under the Weyl group preserves the classes of convex semi-algebraic sets, spectrahedral shadows, and rigidly convex sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original Leader-Follower model, proposed in \cite{zhao2018understanding}, categorizes agents with opinions in $[-1,1]$ into a follower group, a leader group with a positive target opinion in $[0,1]$, and a leader group with a negative target opinion in $[-1,0]$. Leaders maintain a constant attraction to their target, blending it with the average opinion of their group neighbors at each update. Followers, on the other hand, have a constant attraction to the average opinion of their leader group's opinion neighbors, also integrating it with their group neighbors' average opinion. This model was numerically studied in \cite{zhao2018understanding}.
  This paper extends the Leader-Follower model to include a social relationship, variable degrees over time, high-dimensional opinions, and a flexible number of leader groups. We theoretically investigate conditions for asymptotic stability or consensus, particularly in scenarios where a few leaders can dominate the entire population.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of interval-valued functions on Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of an interval-valued function (IVF) defined on Riemannian manifolds is not equivalent to the directional differentiability of its center and half-width functions and hence not to its end point functions. This contrasts with S.-L. Chen's \cite{chen} assertion which says the equivalence holds in terms of endpoint functions of an IVF which is defined on a Hadamard manifold. Additionally, the paper addresses some inaccuracies made by the author which arise when assuming the convexity of a function at a single point in its domain. In light of these arguments, the paper presents some basic results that relate to both the convexity and directional differentiability of an IVF.</description>

      <title>Controlled Lagrangians and Stabilization of Euler--Poincar\'e Equations with Symmetry Breaking Nonholonomic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the method of Controlled Lagrangians to nonholonomic Euler--Poincar\'e equations with advected parameters, specifically to those mechanical systems on Lie groups whose symmetry is broken not only by a potential force but also by nonholonomic constraints. We introduce advected-parameter-dependent quasivelocities in order to systematically eliminate the Lagrange multipliers in the nonholonomic Euler--Poincar\'e equations. The quasivelocities facilitate the method of Controlled Lagrangians for these systems, and lead to matching conditions that are similar to those by Bloch, Leonard, and Marsden for the standard holonomic Euler--Poincar\'e equation. Our motivating example is what we call the pendulum skate, a simple model of a figure skater developed by Gzenda and Putkaradze. We show that the upright spinning of the pendulum skate is stable under certain conditions, whereas the upright sliding equilibrium is always unstable. Using the matching condition, we derive a control law to stabilize the sliding equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Radial Partitioning with Spectral Penalty Parameter Selection in Distributed Optimization for Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes group-based distributed optimization (DO) algorithms on top of intelligent partitioning for the optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Radial partitioning of the graph of a network is introduced as a systematic way to split a large-scale problem into more tractable sub-problems, which can potentially be solved efficiently with methods such as convex relaxations. Spectral parameter selection is introduced for group-based DO as a crucial hyper-parameter selection step in DO. A software package DiCARP is created, which is implemented in Python using the Pyomo optimization package. Our numerical results for different power network instances show that our designed algorithm returns more accurate solutions to the tested problems with fewer iterations than component-based DO. Our results confirm the importance of smart partitioning and parameter selection for large-scale optimization problems on networks.</description>

      <title>Variance reduction techniques for stochastic proximal point algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of finite sums minimization, variance reduction techniques are widely used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art stochastic gradient methods. Their practical impact is clear, as well as their theoretical properties. Stochastic proximal point algorithms have been studied as an alternative to stochastic gradient algorithms since they are more stable with respect to the choice of the step size. However, their variance-reduced versions are not as well studied as the gradient ones. In this work, we propose the first unified study of variance reduction techniques for stochastic proximal point algorithms. We introduce a generic stochastic proximal-based algorithm that can be specified to give the proximal version of SVRG, SAGA, and some of their variants. For this algorithm, in the smooth setting, we provide several convergence rates for the iterates and the objective function values, which are faster than those of the vanilla stochastic proximal point algorithm. More specifically, for convex functions, we prove a sublinear convergence rate of $O(1/k)$. In addition, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we obtain linear convergence rates. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proximal variance reduction methods over their gradient counterparts in terms of the stability with respect to the choice of the step size in most cases, especially for difficult problems.</description>

      <title>ADMM-Tracking Gradient for Distributed Optimization over Asynchronous and Unreliable Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for consensus optimization over networks and a robust extension tailored to deal with asynchronous agents and packet losses. Indeed, to robustly achieve dynamic consensus on the solution estimates and the global descent direction, we embed in our algorithms a distributed implementation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Such a mechanism is suitably interlaced with a local proportional action steering each agent estimate to the solution of the original consensus optimization problem. First, in the case of ideal networks, by using tools from system theory, we prove the linear convergence of the scheme with strongly convex costs. Then, by exploiting the averaging theory, we extend such a first result to prove that the robust extension of our method preserves linear convergence in the case of asynchronous agents and packet losses. Further, by using the notion of Input-to-State Stability, we also guarantee the robustness of the schemes with respect to additional, generic errors affecting the agents' updates. Finally, some numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings and compare our algorithms with other distributed schemes in terms of speed and robustness.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions for the NP-hard Wasserstein Barycenter Problem using a Doubly Nonnegative Relaxation and a Splitting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{simplified} Wasserstein barycenter problem, also known as the cheapest hub problem, consists in selecting one point from each of $k$ given sets, each set consisting of $n$ points, with the aim of minimizing the sum of distances to the barycenter of the $k$ chosen points. This problem is also known as the cheapest hub problem. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We compute the Wasserstein barycenter by exploiting the Euclidean distance matrix structure to obtain a facially reduced doubly nonnegative, \DNNp, relaxation. The facial reduction provides a natural splitting for applying the symmetric alternating directions method of multipliers (\sADMM) to the \DNN relaxation. The \sADMM method exploits structure in the subproblems to find strong upper and lower bounds. In addition, we extend the problem to allow varying $n_j$ points for the $j$-th set.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First we want to illustrate the strength of this \DNN relaxation with a splitting approach. Our numerical tests then illustrate the surprising success on random problems, as we generally, efficiently, find the provable exact solution of this NP-hard problem. Comparisons with current commercial software illustrate this surprising efficiency. However, we demonstrate and prove that there is a duality gap for problems with \emph{enough} multiple optimal solutions, and that this arises from problems with highly symmetrized structure.</description>

      <title>Symmetric SAGE and SONC forms, exactness and quantitative gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classes of sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials (SAGE) and of sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials (SONC) provide nonnegativity certificates which are based on the inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means. We study the cones of symmetric SAGE and SONC forms and their relations to the underlying symmetric nonnegative cone.
  As main results, we provide several symmetric cases where the SAGE or SONC property coincides with nonnegativity and we present quantitative results on the differences in various situations. The results rely on characterizations of the zeroes and the minimizers for symmetric SAGE and SONC forms, which we develop.
  Finally, we also study symmetric monomial mean inequalities and apply SONC certificates to establish a generalized version of Muirhead's inequality.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Trilateration: Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Initial Orbit Determination in Low-Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increase in the number of active satellites and space debris in orbit, the problem of initial orbit determination (IOD) becomes increasingly important, demanding a high accuracy. Over the years, different approaches have been presented such as filtering methods (for example, Extended Kalman Filter), differential algebra or solving Lambert's problem. In this work, we consider a setting of three monostatic radars, where all available measurements are taken approximately at the same instant. This follows a similar setting as trilateration, a state-of-the-art approach, where each radar is able to obtain a single measurement of range and range-rate. Differently, and due to advances in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars, we assume that each location is able to obtain a larger set of range, angle and Doppler shift measurements. Thus, our method can be understood as an extension of trilateration leveraging more recent technology and incorporating additional data. We formulate the problem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which for some number of observations is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method attains the same accuracy as the trilateration method for the same number of measurements and offers an alternative and generalization, returning a more accurate estimation of the satellite's state vector, as the number of available measurements increases.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Second-order Method for a Class of Nonconvex Nonsmooth Composite Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a specific type of nonconvex sparsity-promoting regularization problems, namely those involving $\ell_p$-norm regularization, in conjunction with a twice continuously differentiable loss function. We propose a novel second-order algorithm designed to effectively address this class of challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, showcasing several innovative features: (i) The use of an alternating strategy to solve a reweighted $\ell_1$ regularized subproblem and the subspace approximate Newton step. (ii) The reweighted $\ell_1$ regularized subproblem relies on a convex approximation to the nonconvex regularization term, enabling a closed-form solution characterized by the soft-thresholding operator. This feature allows our method to be applied to various nonconvex regularization problems. (iii) Our algorithm ensures that the iterates maintain their sign values and that nonzero components are kept away from 0 for a sufficient number of iterations, eventually transitioning to a perturbed Newton method. (iv) We provide theoretical guarantees of global convergence, local superlinear convergence in the presence of the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) property, and local quadratic convergence when employing the exact Newton step in our algorithm. We also showcase the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a diverse set of model prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Optimal Control with Performance Guarantees for Unknown Systems with Latent States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17963v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As control engineering methods are applied to increasingly complex systems, data-driven approaches for system identification appear as a promising alternative to physics-based modeling. While the Bayesian approaches prevalent for safety-critical applications usually rely on the availability of state measurements, the states of a complex system are often not directly measurable. It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and the latent state, making the quantification of uncertainties and the design of controllers with formal performance guarantees considerably more challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states based on a combination of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and scenario theory. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>A Hessian-Aware Stochastic Differential Equation for Modelling SGD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time approximation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a crucial tool to study its escaping behaviors from stationary points. However, existing stochastic differential equation (SDE) models fail to fully capture these behaviors, even for simple quadratic objectives. Built on a novel stochastic backward error analysis framework, we derive the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Modified Equation (HA-SME), an SDE that incorporates Hessian information of the objective function into both its drift and diffusion terms. Our analysis shows that HA-SME matches the order-best approximation error guarantee among existing SDE models in the literature, while achieving a significantly reduced dependence on the smoothness parameter of the objective. Further, for quadratic objectives, under mild conditions, HA-SME is proved to be the first SDE model that recovers exactly the SGD dynamics in the distributional sense. Consequently, when the local landscape near a stationary point can be approximated by quadratics, HA-SME is expected to accurately predict the local escaping behaviors of SGD.</description>
