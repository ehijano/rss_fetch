      <title>PD-L1 Classification of Weakly-Labeled Whole Slide Images of Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific and effective breast cancer therapy relies on the accurate quantification of PD-L1 positivity in tumors, which appears in the form of brown stainings in high resolution whole slide images (WSIs). However, the retrieval and extensive labeling of PD-L1 stained WSIs is a time-consuming and challenging task for pathologists, resulting in low reproducibility, especially for borderline images. This study aims to develop and compare models able to classify PD-L1 positivity of breast cancer samples based on WSI analysis, relying only on WSI-level labels. The task consists of two phases: identifying regions of interest (ROI) and classifying tumors as PD-L1 positive or negative. For the latter, two model categories were developed, with different feature extraction methodologies. The first encodes images based on the colour distance from a base color. The second uses a convolutional autoencoder to obtain embeddings of WSI tiles, and aggregates them into a WSI-level embedding. For both model types, features are fed into downstream ML classifiers. Two datasets from different clinical centers were used in two different training configurations: (1) training on one dataset and testing on the other; (2) combining the datasets. We also tested the performance with or without human preprocessing to remove brown artefacts Colour distance based models achieve the best performances on testing configuration (1) with artefact removal, while autoencoder-based models are superior in the remaining cases, which are prone to greater data variability.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Tech Sector Market Downturns based on Macroeconomic Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting stock price movements is a pivotal element of investment strategy, providing insights into potential trends and market volatility. This study specifically examines the predictive capacity of historical stock prices and technical indicators within the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Information Technology Sector, focusing on companies established before 1980. We aim to identify patterns that precede significant, non-transient downturns - defined as declines exceeding 10% from peak values. Utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques, including multiple regression analysis, logistic regression, we analyze an enriched dataset comprising both macroeconomic indicators and market data. Our findings suggest that certain clusters of technical indicators, when combined with broader economic signals, offer predictive insights into forthcoming sector-specific downturns. This research not only enhances our understanding of the factors driving market dynamics in the tech sector but also provides portfolio managers and investors with a sophisticated tool for anticipating and mitigating potential losses from market downturns. Through a rigorous validation process, we demonstrate the robustness of our models, contributing to the field of financial analytics by offering a novel approach to predicting market downturns with significant implications for investment strategies and economic policy planning.</description>

      <title>Kinematics Modeling of Peroxy Free Radicals: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropospheric ozone, known as a concerning air pollutant, has been associated with health issues including asthma, bronchitis, and impaired lung function. The rates at which peroxy radicals react with NO play a critical role in the overall formation and depletion of tropospheric ozone. However, obtaining comprehensive kinetic data for these reactions remains challenging. Traditional approaches to determine rate constants are costly and technically intricate. Fortunately, the emergence of machine learning-based models offers a less resource and time-intensive alternative for acquiring kinetics information. In this study, we leveraged deep reinforcement learning to predict ranges of rate constants (\textit{k}) with exceptional accuracy, achieving a testing set accuracy of 100%. To analyze reactivity trends based on the molecular structure of peroxy radicals, we employed 51 global descriptors as input parameters. These descriptors were derived from optimized minimum energy geometries of peroxy radicals using the quantum composite G3B3 method. Through the application of Integrated Gradients (IGs), we gained valuable insights into the significance of the various descriptors in relation to reaction rates. We successfully validated and contextualized our findings by conducting cross-comparisons with established trends in the existing literature. These results establish a solid foundation for pioneering advancements in chemistry, where computer analysis serves as an inspirational source driving innovation.</description>

      <title>COBRAPRO: A MATLAB toolbox for Physics-based Battery Modeling and Co-simulation Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COBRAPRO is a new open-source physics-based battery modeling software with the capability to conduct closed-loop parameter optimization using experimental data. Physics-based battery models require systematic parameter calibration to accurately predict battery behavior across different usage scenarios. While parameter calibration is essential to predict the dynamic behavior of batteries, many existing open-source DFN tools lack parameter identification features. COBRAPRO addresses this gap by featuring an embedded parameter optimization routines that optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the error between the simulated and experimentally observed current-voltage data. With COBRAPRO, users can non-invasively identify unknown battery model parameters for any given battery chemistry.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</description>

      <title>Physical formula enhanced multi-task learning for pharmacokinetics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has demonstrated remarkable potential in drug dis-covery, where pharmacokinetics plays a crucial role in determining the dosage, safety, and efficacy of new drugs. A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.</description>

      <title>AAVDiff: Experimental Validation of Enhanced Viability and Diversity in Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Capsids through Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have revolutionized gene therapy, but their broad tropism and suboptimal transduction efficiency limit their clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on designing and screening capsid libraries to identify improved vectors. However, the large sequence space and limited resources present challenges in identifying viable capsid variants. In this study, we propose an end-to-end diffusion model to generate capsid sequences with enhanced viability. Using publicly available AAV2 data, we generated 38,000 diverse AAV2 viral protein (VP) sequences, and evaluated 8,000 for viral selection. The results attested the superiority of our model compared to traditional methods. Additionally, in the absence of AAV9 capsid data, apart from one wild-type sequence, we used the same model to directly generate a number of viable sequences with up to 9 mutations. we transferred the remaining 30,000 samples to the AAV9 domain. Furthermore, we conducted mutagenesis on AAV9 VP hypervariable regions VI and V, contributing to the continuous improvement of the AAV9 VP sequence. This research represents a significant advancement in the design and functional validation of rAAV vectors, offering innovative solutions to enhance specificity and transduction efficiency in gene therapy applications.</description>

      <title>Swarm-Based Trajectory Generation and Optimization for Stress-Aligned 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel swarm-based approach for generating optimized stress-aligned trajectories for 3D printing applications. The method utilizes swarming dynamics to simulate the motion of virtual agents along the stress produced in a loaded part. Agent trajectories are then used as print trajectories. With this approach, the complex global trajectory generation problem is subdivided into a set of sequential and computationally efficient quadratic programs. Through comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and experiments, we compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight a remarkable improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a 115x faster computation speed than existing methods. This efficiency, combined with the possibility to tune the trajectories spacing to match the deposition process constraints, makes the potential integration of our approach into existing 3D printing processes seamless. Additionally, the open-hole tensile specimen produced on a conventional fused filament fabrication set-up with our algorithm achieve a notable ~10% improvement in specific modulus compared to existing trajectory optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear truss metamaterials by generative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of machine learning has fueled the discovery of new materials and, especially, metamaterials--truss lattices being their most prominent class. While their tailorable properties have been explored extensively, the design of truss-based metamaterials has remained highly limited and often heuristic, due to the vast, discrete design space and the lack of a comprehensive parameterization. We here present a graph-based deep learning generative framework, which combines a variational autoencoder and a property predictor, to construct a reduced, continuous latent representation covering an enormous range of trusses. This unified latent space allows for the fast generation of new designs through simple operations (e.g., traversing the latent space or interpolating between structures). We further demonstrate an optimization framework for the inverse design of trusses with customized mechanical properties in both the linear and nonlinear regimes, including designs exhibiting exceptionally stiff, auxetic, pentamode-like, and tailored nonlinear behaviors. This generative model can predict manufacturable (and counter-intuitive) designs with extreme target properties beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Inverse designing surface curvatures by deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smooth and curved microstructural topologies found in nature - from soap films to trabecular bone - have inspired several mimetic design spaces for architected metamaterials and bio-scaffolds. However, the design approaches so far have been ad hoc, raising the challenge: how to systematically and efficiently inverse design such artificial microstructures with targeted topological features? Here, we explore surface curvature as a design modality and present a deep learning framework to produce topologies with as-desired curvature profiles. The inverse design framework can generalize to diverse topological features such as tubular, membranous, and particulate features. Moreover, we demonstrate successful generalization beyond both the design and data space by inverse designing topologies that mimic the curvature profile of trabecular bone, spinodoid topologies, and periodic nodal surfaces for application in bio-scaffolds and implants. Lastly, we bridge curvature and mechanics by showing how topological curvature can be designed to promote mechanically beneficial stretching-dominated deformation over bending-dominated deformation.</description>

      <title>No Language is an Island: Unifying Chinese and English in Financial Large Language Models, Instruction Data, and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the progression of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably propelled financial analysis, their application has largely been confined to singular language realms, leaving untapped the potential of bilingual Chinese-English capacity. To bridge this chasm, we introduce ICE-PIXIU, seamlessly amalgamating the ICE-INTENT model and ICE-FLARE benchmark for bilingual financial analysis. ICE-PIXIU uniquely integrates a spectrum of Chinese tasks, alongside translated and original English datasets, enriching the breadth and depth of bilingual financial modeling. It provides unrestricted access to diverse model variants, a substantial compilation of diverse cross-lingual and multi-modal instruction data, and an evaluation benchmark with expert annotations, comprising 10 NLP tasks, 20 bilingual specific tasks, totaling 95k datasets. Our thorough evaluation emphasizes the advantages of incorporating these bilingual datasets, especially in translation tasks and utilizing original English data, enhancing both linguistic flexibility and analytical acuity in financial contexts. Notably, ICE-INTENT distinguishes itself by showcasing significant enhancements over conventional LLMs and existing financial LLMs in bilingual milieus, underscoring the profound impact of robust bilingual data on the accuracy and efficacy of financial NLP.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process learning of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the pivotal tasks in scientific machine learning is to represent underlying dynamical systems from time series data. Many methods for such dynamics learning explicitly require the derivatives of state data, which are not directly available and can be approximated conventionally by finite differences. However, the discrete approximations of time derivatives may result in poor estimations when state data are scarce and/or corrupted by noise, thus compromising the predictiveness of the learned dynamical models. To overcome this technical hurdle, we propose a new method that learns nonlinear dynamics through a Bayesian inference of characterizing model parameters. This method leverages a Gaussian process representation of states, and constructs a likelihood function using the correlation between state data and their derivatives, yet prevents explicit evaluations of time derivatives. Through a Bayesian scheme, a probabilistic estimate of the model parameters is given by the posterior distribution, and thus a quantification is facilitated for uncertainties from noisy state data and the learning process. Specifically, we will discuss the applicability of the proposed method to several typical scenarios for dynamical systems: identification and estimation with an affine parametrization, nonlinear parametric approximation without prior knowledge, and general parameter estimation for a given dynamical system.</description>
