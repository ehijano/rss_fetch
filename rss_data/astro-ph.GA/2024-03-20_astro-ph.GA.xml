      <title>A deep learning model for the density profiles of subhaloes in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Almost Optically Dark Galaxies in DECaLS (I): Detection, Optical Properties and Possible Origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of eight optical counterparts of ALFALFA extragalactic objects from DECaLS, five of which are discovered for the first time. These objects were flagged as HI emission sources with no optical counterparts in SDSS before. Multi-band data reveal their unusual physical properties. They are faint and blue ($g-r=-0.35\sim0.55$), with quite low surface brightness ($\mu_{\rm g,peak}=24.88\sim26.41\,{\rm mag}/{\rm arcsec}^2$), irregular morphologies, low stellar masses ($log_{10}(M_{*}/M_\odot)=5.27\sim7.15$), low star formation rates ($SFR=0.21\sim9.24\times10^{-3}\,{M_\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$), and remarkably high HI-to-stellar mass ratios ($log_{10}(M_{\rm HI}/M_{*}) = 1.72\sim3.22$, except AGC\,215415). They deviate from the scaling relations between HI and optical properties defined by the ALFALFA sample and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. They agree well with the main sequence of star-forming galaxies but exhibit low star-forming efficiency. Based on their physical properties and environments, we speculate that six of these objects may have originated from tidal processes, while the remaining two appear to have isolated origins. They may have had a relatively calm evolutionary history and only begun to form stars recently.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\sim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, with haloes more massive than that also provided an essential contribution.</description>

      <title>Evolution and distribution of superbubbles in simulated Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback plays a crucial role in regulating baryon cycles of a galactic ecosystem, and may manifest itself in the formation of superbubbles in the interstellar medium. In this work, we used a set of high-resolution simulations to systematically study the properties and evolution of superbubbles in galactic environments. The simulations were based on the SMUGGLE galaxy formation framework using the hydrodynamical moving-mesh code Arepo, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 4 \, \rm pc$ and mass resolution of $\sim 10^3 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. We identified superbubbles and tracked their time evolution using the parent stellar associations within the bubbles. The X-ray luminosity-size distribution of superbubbles in the fiducial run is largely consistent with the observations of nearby galaxies. The size of superbubbles shows a double-peaked distribution, with the peaks attributed to early feedback (radiative and stellar wind feedback) and supernova feedback. The early feedback tends to suppress the subsequent supernova feedback, and it is strongly influenced by star formation efficiency, which regulates the environmental density. Our results show that the volume filling factor of hot gas ($T &gt; 10^{5.5} ~\mathrm{K}$) is about $12 \%$ averaged over a region of 4 kpc in height and 20 kpc in radius centered on the disk of the galaxy. Overall, the properties of superbubbles are sensitive to the choice of subgrid galaxy formation models and can, therefore, be used to constrain these models.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feedback-driven Outflows on Bar Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling between the temporal variation from galaxy-formation feedback and the bar instability. We show that fluctuations from mass outflow on star-formation time scales affect the radial motion of disk orbits. The resulting incoherence in orbital phase leads to the disruption of the bar-forming dynamics. Bar formation is suppressed in starburst galaxies that have fluctuation time scales within the range 10 Myr to 200 Myr with repeated events with wind mass 15% of the disk within 0.5 scale lengths or 1.4% of the total disk mass. The work done by feedback is capable of reducing the amplitude or, with enough amplitude, destroying an existing bar. AGN feedback with similar amplitude and timescales would have similar behavior. To model the dynamics of the coupling and interpret the results of the full N-body simulations, we introduce a generalization of the Hamiltonian mean-field (HMF) model, drawing inspiration from the Lynden-Bell (1979) mechanism for bar growth. Our non-linear 'BarHMF' model is designed to reproduce linear perturbation theory in the low-amplitude limit. Notably, without star-formation feedback, this model exhibits exponential growth whose rate depends on disk mass and reproduces the expected saturation of bar growth observed in N-body simulations. We describe several promising applications of the BarHMF model beyond this study.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the clustering of quasars and galaxies at $z\approx6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at $z\approx6$. The auto-correlation function of faint $z\approx6$ quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at $z\approx2-4$. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of $z\approx6$ quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in $\approx10^{12.4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ halos (corresponding to $\approx5\sigma$ fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low ($\lesssim1\%$); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos ($\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of $\approx20\%$. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at $z\approx2-6$, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Triaxial Schwarzschild Models of NGC 708: a 10-billion solar mass black hole in a low dispersion galaxy with a Kroupa IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $(1.0 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ Supermassive Black Hole (BH) at the centre of NGC 708, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy of Abell 262. Such high BH masses are very rare and allow to investigate BH - host galaxy scaling relations at the high mass end, which in turn provide hints about the (co)evolution of such systems. NGC~708 is found to be an outlier in all the canonical scaling relations except for those linking the BH mass to the core properties. The galaxy mass-to-light ratio points to a Kroupa IMF rather than Salpeter, with this finding confirmed using photometry in two different bands. We perform this analysis using our novel triaxial Schwarzschild code to integrate orbits in a 5-dimensional space, using a semi-parametric deprojected light density to build the potential and non-parametric Line-of-Sight Velocity Distributions (LOSVDs) derived from long-slit spectra recently acquired at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to exploit the full information in the kinematic. We find that the galaxy geometry changes as a function of the radius going from prolate, nearly spherical in the central regions to triaxial at large radii, highlighting the need to go beyond constant shape profiles. Our analysis is only the second of its kind and will systematically be used in the future to hunt Supermassive Black Holes in giant ellipticals.</description>

      <title>Star formation exists in all early-type galaxies -- evidence from ubiquitous structure in UV images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent surveys have demonstrated the widespread presence of UV emission in early-type (elliptical/S0) galaxies, suggesting the presence of star formation in many of these systems. However, potential UV contributions from old and young stars, together with model uncertainties, makes it challenging to confirm the presence of young stars using integrated photometry alone. This is particularly true in ETGs that are fainter in the UV and have red UV-optical colours. An unambiguous way of disentangling the source of the UV is to look for structure in UV images. Optical images of ETGs, which are dominated by old stars, are smooth and devoid of structure. If the UV is also produced by these old stars, then the UV images will share this smoothness, while, if driven by young stars, they will exhibit significant structure. We compare the UV and optical morphologies of 32 ETGs (93 percent of which are at $z&lt;0.03$) using quantitative parameters (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness and the S\'ersic index), calculated via deep UV and optical images with similar resolution. Regardless of stellar mass, UV-optical colour or the presence of interactions, the asymmetry and clumpiness of ETGs is significantly (often several orders of magnitudes) larger in the UV than in the optical, while the UV S\'ersic indices are typically lower than their optical counterparts. The ubiquitous presence of structure demonstrates that the UV flux across our entire ETG sample is dominated by young stars and indicates that star formation exists in all ETGs in the nearby Universe.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

      <title>The role of density breaks in driving spiral structure in disc galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that stellar discs are destabilized by sharp features in their phase space, driving recurrent spiral modes. We explore the extent to which surface-density breaks in disc galaxies - which represent sharp changes in the gradient of the disc density - drive new spiral modes. We employ linear perturbation theory to investigate how disc breaks alter the eigenmode spectrum of an otherwise pure exponential disc. We find that the presence of a density break gives rise to a set of new, vigorously growing, modes. For a given multiplicity, these edge modes occur in pairs, with closely separated resonances between each pair. The growth rate of edge modes decreases when the break is weakened or moved outward to lower-density regions of the disc. Both down- and up-bending profiles excite edge modes, whose origin can be best understood via the gravitational torques they exert on the underlying disc. When the profile is down-bending (Type II) the faster growing mode is the inner one while in the up-bending (Type III) case the outer mode is faster growing. In both cases the faster growing mode has a corotation almost coincident with the break. We show that the torques of the edge modes tend to smoothen the break.</description>

      <title>The Plane Quasar Survey: First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 305 QSO candidates having $|b| &lt; 30^{\circ}$, the majority with GALEX magnitudes NUV &lt; 18.75. To generate this sample, we apply UV-IR color selection criteria to photometric data from the Ultraviolet GAlactic Plane Survey (UVGAPS) as part of GALEX-CAUSE, the Million Quasars Catalog, Gaia DR2, and Pan-STARRS DR1. 165 of these 305 candidate UV-bright AGN (54%) have published spectroscopic redshifts from 45 different surveys, confirming them as AGN. We further obtained low-dispersion, optical, longslit spectra with the APO 3.5-m, MDM 2.4-m, and MDM 1.3-m telescopes for 84 of the candidates, and confirm 86% (N = 72) as AGN, generally with z &lt; 0.6. These sources fill a gap in the Galactic latitude coverage of the available samples of known UV-bright QSO background probes. Along with a description of the confirmed QSO properties, we provide the fully-reduced, flux and wavelength-calibrated spectra of 84 low-latitude QSOs through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. Future HST/COS spectroscopy of these low-Galactic-latitude QSOs has the potential to transform our view of the Milky Way and Local Group circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Evidence of extreme ionization conditions and low metallicity in GHZ2/GLASS-z12 from a combined analysis of NIRSpec and MIRI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GHZ2/GLASS-z12 has been recently observed by JWST with both NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, making it the most distant galaxy ($z_{spec}=12.34$) with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical. It is identified as a strong CIV$_{1549}$ emitter with many other detected emission lines (NIV], HeII, OIII], NIII], CIII], [OII], [NeIII], [OIII], and H$\alpha$), including a remarkable OIII$_{1333}$ Bowen fluorescence line. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec+MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical diagnostics (namely R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme ionization conditions, with O32 $=1.39 \pm 0.19$ and Ne3O2 $=0.37 \pm 0.18$ in stark excess compared to typical values in the ISM at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an AGN or with a compact, very dense star-forming environment ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ $\sim 10^2$-$10^3$ Msun/yr/kpc$^2$), with a high ionization parameter ($\log_{10}$(U) $=-1.75 \pm 0.16$), a high ionizing photon production efficiency $\log(\xi_{\rm ion}) = 25.7_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$, and a low, although not pristine, metal content ranging between $5\%$ and $11\%$ Z$_\odot$, indicating a rapid enrichment of the ISM in the last few Myrs. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons ($\sim 10\%$) are leaking outside. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV to optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators. (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star-formation in a low metallicity, high density, and extreme ionization environment. (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at $z \gtrsim 10$, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ a Galactic Low Energy Cosmic Rays tracer</title>

Abstract: Context. Investigating the diagnostic power of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Charge-Exchange (CE) emission as Low-Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays(LECRs) tracer in diffuse regions. Aims. In this work, we define and test a spectroscopic indicator of CE reactions between LECRs protons and neutral hydrogen atoms of the diffuse medium. This indicator can be used for mapping LECRs density in diffuse clouds and can lead to the identification of new LECRs sources as we expect density variations caused by the distance between an observed cloud and the nearest site of particle acceleration. We also lay the foundations for the definition of a photometric indicator to be used in the next full-sky photometric surveys such as the Vera Rubin 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods. Based on literature cross-sections, we calculate H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line profile ratio in the case of CE and compare it with the recombination ratio. We then test our results on the Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 and we explore how the spectroscopic constraints can turn into a photometric indicator based on colour indices. Results. We find that, in shocked environments, CE between LECRS and neutral hydrogen become the dominant process for Balmer lines emission. The hydrogen spectroscopic emission is expected to be modified, with respect to the recombination Balmer decrement,to result in double the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ with respect to a similar but quiescent region. The test on the known Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 confirm the efficiency of our spectroscopic indicator. Therefore we explore possible conversions of the spectroscopic indicator into colour indices combinations. This is the first step toward the definition and test of a photometric indicator for tracing LECRs to be applied in the LSST pipelines to photometrically identify new LECRs accelerators in the whole Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Feedback and galaxy dynamics: A study of turbulence and star formation in 34 galaxies using the PHANGS survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between interstellar turbulent speed and local star formation rate surface density, Sigma_SFR, is studied using CO observations in the PHANGS survey. The local velocity dispersion of molecular gas, sigma, increases with Sigma_SFR, but the virial parameter, alpha_vir, is about constant, suggesting the molecular gas remains self-gravitating. The correlation arises because sigma depends on the molecular surface density, Sigma_mol, and object cloud mass, M_mol, with the usual molecular cloud correlations, while Sigma_SFR increases with both of these quantities because of a nearly constant star formation efficiency for CO. Pressure fluctuations with Delta Sigma_SFR are also examined. Azimuthal variations of molecular pressure, Delta P_mol, have a weaker correlation with Delta Sigma_SFR than expected from the power-law correlation between the total quantities, suggesting slightly enhanced SFR efficiency per molecule in spiral arms. Dynamical equilibrium pressure and star formation rate correlate well for the whole sample, as P_DE~Sigma_SFR^1.3, which is steeper than in other studies. The azimuthal fluctuations, Delta P_DE(Delta Sigma_SFR), follow the total correlation P_DE(Sigma_SFR) closely, hinting that some of this correlation may be a precursor to star formation, rather than a reaction. Galactic dynamical processes correlate linearly such that Sigma_SFR~(Sigma_gas R)^(1.0\pm0.3) for total gas surface density Sigma_gas and galactic dynamical rates, R, equal to kappa, A, or Omega, representing epicyclic frequency, shear rate A, and orbit rate Omega. These results suggest important roles for both feedback and galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the abundance pattern and charge-exchange emission in the M82 centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) in starburst galaxies contains plenty of chemical elements synthesised by core-collapse supernova explosions. By measuring the abundances of these metals, we can study the chemical enrichment within galaxies and the transportation of metals into circumgalactic environments through powerful outflows. We perform the spectral analysis of the X-ray emissions from the M82 core using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton to accurately estimate the metal abundances in the ISM. We analyse over 300 ks of RGS data observed with fourteen position angles, covering an 80 arcsec cross-dispersion width. We employ multi-temperature thermal plasma components in collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) to reproduce the observed spectra, each exhibiting different spatial broadenings. The O vii band CCD image shows a broader distribution compared to those for O viii and Fe-L bands. The O viii line profiles have a prominent double-peaked structure, corresponding to the northward and southward outflows. The O vii triplet feature exhibits marginal peaks, and a single CIE component, convolved with the O vii band image, approximately reproduces the spectral shape. Combining a CIE model with a charge-exchange emission model also successfully reproduces the O vii line profiles. However, the ratio of these two components varies significantly with the observed position angles, which is physically implausible. Spectral fitting of the broadband spectra suggests a multi-temperature phase in the ISM, approximated by three components at 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 keV. Notably, the 0.1 keV component exhibits a broader distribution than the 0.4 and 0.7 keV plasmas. The derived abundance pattern shows super-solar N/O, solar Ne/O and Mg/O, and half-solar Fe/O ratios. These results indicate the chemical enrichments by core-collapse supernovae in starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Chemical differentiation and gas kinematics around massive young stellar objects in RCW 120</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a spectral survey towards a dense molecular condensation and young stellar objects (YSOs) projected on the border of the HII region RCW 120 and discuss emission of 20 molecules which produce the brightest lines. The survey was performed with the APEX telescope in the frequency range 200 -- 260 GHz. We provide evidences for two outflows in the dense gas. The first one is powered by the RCW 120 S2 YSO and oriented along the line of sight. The second outflow around RCW 120 S1 is aligned almost perpendicular to the line of sight. We show that area with bright emission of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH and CH$_3$CN are organised into an onion-like structure where CH$_3$CN traces warmer regions around the YSOs than the other molecules. Methanol seems to be released to the gas phase by shock waves in the vicinity of the outflows while thermal evaporation still does not work towards the YSOs. We find only a single manifestation of the UV radiation to the molecules, namely, enhanced abundances of small hydrocarbons CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in the photo-dissociation region.</description>

Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Broadband X-ray/UV/optical time-resolved spectroscopy of NGC 5548: The origin of the UV/optical variability in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been subject to long X-rays/UV/optical monitoring campaigns. These campaigns reveal a strong correlation between the various UV and optical bands, with time lags increasing with wavelength. In a series of papers, we demonstrated that a scenario in which a central X-ray source illuminates the accretion disc explains the observed correlations. However, some of the monitored AGN show low/moderate X-rays-UV correlations, which could challenge this scenario. In this paper, we study the broadband X-ray/UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of NGC 5548, one of the most intensively monitored AGN. We aim to test if the X-ray illumination model explains the broadband spectral behaviour of the source, despite the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. We model the broadband time-averaged SED, from the STORM monitoring campaign of the source, using the KYNSED model which assumes an X-ray illuminated disc. We assume that the accretion process powers the X-ray corona. We also model 15 time-resolved SEDs from the same campaign to check whether this scenario can account for the observed spectral variability. The proposed model describes well the time-averaged and the time-resolved SEDs of NGC 5548. In this scenario, the corona height, the X-ray photon index, and the power transferred to the corona all vary. This explains the variability behaviour at different wavelengths. The best-fit model is obtained for a non-rotating black hole accreting at a constant rate of 5% its Eddington limit. Since each of the variable parameters affects the observed flux in a particular way, the combined variability of all parameters explains the moderate X-ray-UV/optical correlation. The X-ray illuminated disc model provides a complete description of the behaviour of NGC 5548, explaining its broadband SEDs, time-lag spectrum, and its power spectral distribution.</description>

      <title>Cepheids with giant companions. II. Spectroscopic confirmation of nine new double-lined binary systems composed of two Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Cepheids with giant companions are crucial for studying the physical properties of Cepheid variables, providing the best means to measure their masses. Systems composed of two Cepheids are even more important but to date, only one such system in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) was known. Our current aim is to increase the number of these systems tenfold and provide their basic characteristics. The final goal is to obtain the physical properties of the component Cepheids, including their masses and radii, and to learn about their evolution in the multiple systems, also revealing their origin. We started a spectroscopic monitoring of nine unresolved pairs of Cepheids from the OGLE catalog, to check if they are gravitationally bound. Two of these so-called double Cepheids are located in the LMC, five in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and two in the Milky Way (MW). We report the spectroscopic detection of binarity of all 9 of these double Cepheids with orbital periods from 2 to 18 years. This increases the number of known binary double (BIND) Cepheids from 1 to 10 and triples the number of all confirmed double-lined binary (SB2) Cepheids. For five BIND Cepheids disentangled pulsational light curves of the components show anti-correlated phase shifts due to orbital motion. We show the first empirical evidence that typical period-luminosity relations (PLRs) are rather binary Cepheid PLRs that include the companion's light. The statistics of pulsation period ratios of BIND Cepheids do not agree with those expected for pairs of the same-age Cepheids. These ratios together with the mass ratios far from unity suggest merger-origin of at least one component for about half of the systems. The SMC and MW objects are the first found in SB2 systems composed of giants in their host galaxies. The Milky Way BIND Cepheids are also the closest such systems, being located at about 11 and 26 kpc.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model.
  We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>Ring nebulae around Wolf-Rayet stars in M33 as seen by SITELLE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an analysis of nebulae around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M33 using data collected by the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope as part of the SIGNALS Large Program. Of the 211 known Wolf-Rayet stars in M33, 178 are located in the fields observed in this study. We present the results of this analysis in the form of a comprehensive summary of all nebulae found around the observed WR stars. Based on three criteria we find to be the most effective for their detection, we detect a clear association with a circumstellar bubble around 33 of them (19\%). Our results show that the presence of bubbles does not correlate with the spectral type of the central star. The mean diameter of the WR nebulae we have found is 21 parsecs.</description>

      <title>Episodicity in accretion-ejection processes associated with IRAS 15398-3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The protostar IRAS 15398-3359 is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow ejected in an nearly northeast-southwest (NE-SW) direction which has been extensively studied. It has been suggested previous episodic accretion events by this source. Furthermore, the analysis of the morphology and kinematics of the molecular outflow revealed the presence of four $^{12}$CO(2-1) bipolar elliptical shock-like structures identified in both lobes. These structures seem to trace different ejections inclined $\sim$10\deg on the plane of the sky from each other. This led to the hypothesis that the outflow axis likely precesses and launches material episodically. We analyze ALMA archive observations in Band 6, revealing the presence of low-velocity ($&lt;3.5$km s$^{-1}$) emission from the line $^{12}$CO(2-1) to the south and north of the protostar. We study the morphology and kinematics of the gas, which seems to support the hypothesis of a precessing episodic outflow. The ALMA observations reveal a north-south (N-S) outflow most likely associated with the IRAS 15398-3359 protostellar system. This outflow could be older than the well-studied NE-SW outflow. The orientation of the N-S outflow is 50\deg - 60\deg on the plane of the sky away from that of the NE-SW outflow. We also analyze the Spectral Energy Distribution of a far away young star and preliminary discard it as the driver of the SE outflow remnants. The new observations support the hypothesis of strong episodic accretion-ejection events in IRAS 15398-3359, accompanied by dramatic changes in the orientation of its ejection axis, implying that all the outflows in the region may have been driven by the same protostar.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new hot-PAGB star identified in the Galactic GC E3, which is one of the first to show a binary signature among the identified PAGB stars of GCs. We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis to study the evolutionary status of the newly identified hot-PAGB star. We use Gaia EDR3 proper motion (PM) and parallax measurements to confirm the cluster membership. We supplement the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from multi-epoch high resolution (R$\sim$28000) spectroscopic observations. We fitted the spectral energy distribution of 30 photometric fluxes of the PAGB star from ultraviolet to infra-red passbands with the TLUSTY BSTAR2006 stellar atmosphere model to derive its physical parameters, \Teff, $\log g$, \Lbol, and R. We derive the chemical abundances of nine elements (He, C, N, O, Ne, Al, Si, S, and Fe) using spectroscopic measurements. The derived chemical abundances, kinematic information, and stellar parameters are used to study the evolution history of the star. The PM and parallax of the identified PAGB star match well with cluster parameters, which confirms its cluster membership. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio, q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex matches well with the cluster metallicity. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the H-R diagram suggest a current mass of the identified PAGB star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars of GCs with the evidence of 3rd dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: the coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology in light of the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys have reported measurements of the density of matter, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and the amplitude of clustering, $\sigma_8$, that are in tension with the values inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background. While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter. We also show that the dependence of baryonic feedback on cosmology can be modelled as a function of the ratio $f_\mathrm{b}/c^2_\mathrm{v}\sim f_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{m}\sigma_8)^{1/4}$ of the universal baryon fraction, $f_\mathrm{b}$, to a velocity-based definition of halo concentration, $c^2_\mathrm{v}$, giving an accurate fitting formula for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Although the combination of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms can resolve the tension, the models with neutrinos and decaying dark matter are challenged by constraints on the expansion history.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Galaxy Outflows at $z\sim 6-9$ with Imaging and Spectroscopic Signatures Identified with JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present statistics of $z\sim 6-9$ galaxy outflows indicated by spatially-extended gas emission and broad lines. With a total of 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$ in the JWST CEERS, GLASS, and ERO data, we find four galaxies with [O{\sc iii}]+H$\beta$ ionized gas emission significantly extended beyond the kpc-scale stellar components on the basis of the emission line images constructed by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband (line on/off-band) images. By comparison with low-$z$ galaxies, the fraction of galaxies with the spatially extended gas, 4/18, at $z\sim 6-9$ is an order of magnitude higher than those at $z\sim 0-1$, which can be explained by events triggered by frequent major mergers at high redshift. We also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$, and identify five galaxies with broad ($140-800$ km s$^{-1}$) lines in the [O{\sc iii}] forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows. One galaxy at $z=6.38$ shows both the spatially-extended gas emission and the broad lines, while none of the galaxies with the spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines present a clear signature of AGN either in the line diagnostics or Type 1 AGN line broadening ($&gt;1000$ km s$^{-1}$), which hint outflows mainly driven by stellar feedback. The existence of galaxies with/without spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines may be explained by different viewing angles towards outflows, or that these are galaxies in the early, late, post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift, where the relatively large fractions of such galaxies indicate the longer-duration and/or more-frequent outflows at the early cosmic epoch.</description>

      <title>Hooks &amp; Bends in the Radial Acceleration Relation: Discriminatory Tests for Dark Matter and MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) connects the total gravitational acceleration of a galaxy at a given radius, $a_{\rm tot}(r)$, with that accounted for by baryons at the same radius, $a_{\rm bar}(r)$. The shape and tightness of the RAR for rotationally-supported galaxies have characteristics in line with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and can also arise within the Cosmological Constant + Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. We use zoom simulations of 20 galaxies with stellar masses of $M_{\star} \, \simeq 10^{7-11} \, M_{\odot}$ to study the RAR in the \texttt{FIRE-2} simulations. We highlight the existence of simulated galaxies with non-monotonic RAR tracks that ``hook'' down from the average relation. These hooks are challenging to explain in Modified Inertia theories of MOND, but naturally arise in all of our \lcdm-simulated galaxies that are dark-matter dominated at small radii and have feedback-induced cores in their dark matter haloes. We show, analytically and numerically, that downward hooks are expected in such cored haloes because they have non-monotonic acceleration profiles. We also extend the relation to accelerations below those traced by disc galaxy rotation curves. In this regime, our simulations exhibit ``bends'' off of the MOND-inspired extrapolation of the RAR, which, at large radii, approach $a_{\rm tot} \, \approx \, a_{\rm bar} \, /f_{\rm b}$, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the cosmic baryon fraction. Future efforts to search for these hooks and bends in real galaxies will provide interesting tests for MOND and $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive model for the formation and evolution of the faintest Milky Way dwarf satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the semi-analytic model Galacticus in order to accurately reproduce the observed properties of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way. We find that reproducing observational determinations of the halo occupation fraction and mass-metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies requires us to include H$_2$ cooling, an updated UV background radiation model, and to introduce a model for the metal content of the intergalactic medium. By fine-tuning various model parameters and incorporating empirical constraints, we have tailored the model to match the statistical properties of Milky Way dwarf galaxies, such as their luminosity function and size$-$mass relation. We have validated our modified semi-analytic framework by undertaking a comparative analysis of the resulting galaxy-halo connection. We predict a total of $300 ^{+75} _{-99}$ satellites with an absolute $V$-band magnitude (M$_{V}$) less than $0$ within $300$ kpc from our Milky Way-analogs. The fraction of subhalos that host a galaxy at least this bright drops to $50\%$ by a halo peak mass of $\sim 8.9 \times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, consistent with the occupation fraction inferred from the latest observations of Milky Way satellite population.</description>

      <title>Identification of High-Redshift Galaxy Overdensities in GOODS-N and GOODS-S</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities at $4.9 &lt; z_{\,\mathrm{spec}} &lt; 8.9$ in both the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS in addition to JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. High-redshift galaxy candidates are identified using HST+JWST photometry spanning $\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. We confirmed the redshifts for roughly a third of these galaxies using JWST/FRESCO spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.9-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ through identification of either $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ or $\left[\mathrm{OIII}\right]\lambda5008$ around the best-fit photometric redshift. The rest-UV magnitudes and continuum slopes of these galaxies were inferred from the photometry: the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. We find $17$ significant ($\delta_{\mathrm{gal}} \geq 3.04$, $N_{\mathrm{galaxies}} \geq 4$) galaxy overdensities across both fields ($7$ in GOODS-N and $10$ in GOODS-S), including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at $\left&lt; z_{\mathrm{\,spec}} \right&gt; = 7.955$ and $\left&lt; z_{\mathrm{\,spec}} \right&gt; = 8.222$ (representing densities around $\sim 6$ and $\sim 12$ times that of a random volume). We estimate the total halo mass of these large-scale structures to be $11.5 \leq \mathrm{log}_{10}\left(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}\right) \leq 13.4$ using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, which are likely underestimates as a result of incompleteness. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with $\mathrm{log}_{10}\left(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}\right) \gtrsim 14$ by $z = 0$.</description>

      <title>A Steep Decline in the Galaxy Space Density Beyond Redshift 9 in the CANUCS UV Luminosity Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift $z&gt;7.5$ selected from deep \jwst\ NIRCam imaging of five widely-separated sightlines in the CANUCS survey. Two-thirds of the pointings and 80\% of the galaxies are covered by 12 to 14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium bands, providing accurate photometric redshifts and robustness against low redshift interlopers. A sample of 28 galaxies at $z&gt;7.5$ with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts 8 to 12, finding a slightly higher normalization than previously seen with \hst\ at redshifts 8 to 10. We observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from $z=8$ to $12$ than found by most \jwst\ Cycle 1 studies. In particular, we find only eight galaxies at $z&gt;10$ and none at $z&gt;12.5$, with no $z&gt;10$ galaxies brighter than F277W AB=28 or $M_{\rm UV}=-20$ in our unmasked, delensed survey area of 53.4 square arcminutes. We attribute the lack of bright $z&gt;10$ galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sightlines. The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between $z=8$ and $12$ is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency, without invoking any special adjustments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a horseshoe-shaped ring (HSR) of diffuse emission in J1407+0453 from the Faint Images of Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey using the Very Large Array telescope. An optical galaxy SDSSJ140709.01+045302.1 is present near the limb of the HSR of J1407+0453, with a spectroscopic redshift of $z=0.13360$. The total extent of the source, including the diffuse emission of J1407+0453, is 65 arcsec (with a physical extent of 160 kpc), whereas the diameter of the HSR is approximately 10 arcsec (25 kpc). The flux density of HSR is $\sim$47 mJy at 1400 MHz whereas the flux densities of whole diffuse emission of J1407+0453 at 1400 MHz and 150 MHz are 172 mJy and 763 mJy, respectively. We measure the radio luminosity of HSR J1407+0453 as 1.94 $\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ with a spectral index $\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.67$. The black hole mass of J1407+0453 is 5.8$\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. We compare the HSR of diffuse emission of J1407+0453 with other discovered diffused circular sources. The possible formation scenarios for J1407+0453 are discussed to understand the nature of the source. We present a spectral index map of J1407+0453 to study the spectral properties of the source.</description>

      <title>A Dusty Locale: Evolution of Galactic Dust Populations from Milky Way to Dwarf-Mass Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations indicate dust populations vary between galaxies and within them, suggesting a complex life cycle and evolutionary history. Here we investigate the evolution of galactic dust populations across cosmic time using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, spanning $M_{\rm vir}=10^{9-12}M_{\odot};\,M_{*}=10^{6-11}\,M_{\odot}$. Our simulations incorporate a dust evolution model that accounts for the dominant sources of dust production, growth, and destruction and follows the evolution of specific dust species. All galactic dust populations in our suite exhibit similar evolutionary histories, with gas-dust accretion being the dominant producer of dust mass for all but the most metal-poor galaxies. Similar to previous works, we find the onset of efficient gas-dust accretion occurs above a `critical' metallicity threshold ($Z_{\rm crit}$). Due to this threshold, our simulations reproduce observed trends between galactic D/Z and metallicity and element depletion trends in the ISM. However, we find $Z_{\rm crit}$ varies between dust species due to differences in key element abundances, dust physical properties, and life cycle processes resulting in $Z_{\rm crit}\sim0.05Z_{\odot},\,0.2Z_{\odot},\,0.5Z_{\odot}$ for metallic iron, silicates, and carbonaceous dust, respectively. These variations could explain the lack of small carbonaceous grains observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We also find a delay between the onset of gas-dust accretion and when a dust population reaches equilibrium, which we call the equilibrium timescale ($\tau_{\rm eq}$). The relation between $\tau_{\rm eq}$ and the metal enrichment timescale of a galaxy, determined by its recent evolutionary history, can contribute to the scatter in the observed relation between galactic D/Z and metallicity.</description>

Abstract: Many observable properties of globular clusters (GCs) provide valuable insights for unveiling the hierarchical assembly of their host galaxy. For the Milky Way (MW) in particular, GCs from different accreted satellite galaxies show distinct chemical, spatial, kinematic, and age distributions. Here we examine such clustering features for model GC populations in simulated galaxies, which are carefully selected to match various observational constraints of the MW assembly. We evaluate several widely used clustering, dimensionality reduction, and supervised classification methods on these model GCs, using 10 properties that are observable in the MW. We can categorize in-situ and ex-situ formed GCs with about 90% accuracy, based solely on their clustering features in these 10 variables. The methods are also effective in distinguishing the last major merger in MW-analogs with similar accuracy. Although challenging, we still find it possible to identify one, and only one, additional smaller satellite. We develop a new technique to classify the progenitors of MW GCs by combining several methods and weighting them by the validated accuracy. According to this technique, about 60% of GCs belong to the in-situ group, 20% are associated with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus event, and 10% are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The remaining 10% of GCs cannot be reliably associated with any single accretion event.</description>

Abstract: A detailed measurement is made of the metallicity distributions, kinematics and dynamics of the thin and thick disks, across a large disk volume (5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars. The metallicity distributions results show that the radial metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R of the thin disk weakens with $|Z|$ from $-$0.06 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&lt;$ 0.25 kpc to $-$0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&gt;$ 2.75 kpc, while the thick disk displays a global weak positive $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R, generally weaker than 0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$. The vertical metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ weakened steadily from $-$0.36 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $R$ $\sim$ 5.5 kpc to $-$0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around R $&gt;$ 11.5 kpc for the thin disk, while the thick disk presents an almost constant value (nearly $-$0.06 $\sim$ $-$0.08 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for all the $R$ bins. These results indicate the contribution of the radial migration to the disk evolution, and the obvious north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may be linked to the disk warp and/or the disk perturbation events. The oscillations of the corrected $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ with $R$ are likely because of the resonances with the Galactic Bar. Our detailed measurements of $\Delta$V$_{\phi}$/$\Delta$[Fe/H] indicate an "inside-out" and "upside-down" star formation scenario for the thick disk. The results of eccentricity distributions and [$\alpha$/Fe]--velocity dispersion relations are likely to suggest that the thick disk stars require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Improving the open cluster census. III. Using cluster masses, radii, and dynamics to create a cleaned open cluster catalogue</title>

Abstract: The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.

Abstract: The unprecedented infrared spectroscopic capabilities of JWST have provided high-quality interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity measurements and enabled characterization of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$ for the first time. We analyze the gas-phase MZR and its evolution in a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations at $z=5-12$ and for stellar masses $M_* \sim 10^6-10^{10} \rm{M}_\odot$. These simulations implement a multi-channel stellar feedback model and produce broadly realistic galaxy properties, including when evolved to $z=0$. The simulations predict very weak redshift evolution of the MZR over the redshift range studied, with the normalization of the MZR increasing by less than $0.01$ dex as redshift decreases from $z = 12$ to $z=5$. The median MZR in the simulations is well-approximated as a constant power-law relation across this redshift range given by $\log(Z/Z_\odot) = 0.37\log(M_*/\rm{M}_\odot) - 4.3$. We find good agreement between our best-fit model and recent observations made by JWST at high redshift. The weak evolution of the MZR at $z &gt; 5$ contrasts with the evolution at $z \lesssim 3$, where increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift is observed and predicted by most models. The FIRE-2 simulations predict increasing scatter in the gas-phase MZR with decreasing stellar mass, in qualitative agreement with some observations.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>The transient event in NGC 1566 from 2017 to 2019 I. An eccentric accretion disk and a turbulent, disk-dominated broad-line region unveiled by double-peaked Ca II and O I lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 1566 is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts, which are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2. We analyze data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2m SALT between July 2018 and October 2019 and supplement our data set with optical to near-infrared spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, HeI, HeII lines and the coronal lines [FeVII], [FeX] and [FeXI]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of OI 8446 and the CaII 8498,8542,8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked OI 8446 and CaII 8498,8542,8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the OI and CaII lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): I. What triggered the current episode of eruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An unbiased spectral survey of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, was carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 6. The detected line emission from various molecules reveals morphological/kinematical features in both the Keplerian disk and the infalling envelope. A direct infall signature, red-shifted absorption against continuum, has been detected in CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, and H$_2$CO. HCO$^+$ and SO show large arm-like structures that probably connect from an infalling envelope to the disk. HCN and H$_2$CO reveal a distinct boundary between the inner and outer disk and reveal tentative spiral structures connecting the outer disk to the inner disk. HNC shows a large central emission hole (r $\sim$0.3\arcsec) due to its chemical conversion to HCN at high temperatures. The HDO emission, a direct tracer of the water sublimation region, has been detected in the disk. Molecular emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) is confined within the HDO emission boundary, and HCO$^+$ has an emission hole in its distribution due to its destruction by water. Together, these features suggest that the current episode of eruption in V883 Ori may be triggered by the infall from the envelope to the outer disk, generating a spiral wave, which propagates inward and greatly enhances the accretion onto the central star.</description>
