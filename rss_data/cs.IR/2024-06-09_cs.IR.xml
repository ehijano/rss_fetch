      <title>Dynamic Online Recommendation for Two-Sided Market with Bayesian Incentive Compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a crucial role in internet economies by connecting users with relevant products or services. However, designing effective recommender systems faces two key challenges: (1) the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in balancing new product exploration against exploiting known preferences, and (2) dynamic incentive compatibility in accounting for users' self-interested behaviors and heterogeneous preferences. This paper formalizes these challenges into a Dynamic Bayesian Incentive-Compatible Recommendation Protocol (DBICRP). To address the DBICRP, we propose a two-stage algorithm (RCB) that integrates incentivized exploration with an efficient offline learning component for exploitation. In the first stage, our algorithm explores available products while maintaining dynamic incentive compatibility to determine sufficient sample sizes. The second stage employs inverse proportional gap sampling integrated with an arbitrary machine learning method to ensure sublinear regret. Theoretically, we prove that RCB achieves $O(\sqrt{KdT})$ regret and satisfies Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC) under a Gaussian prior assumption. Empirically, we validate RCB's strong incentive gain, sublinear regret, and robustness through simulations and a real-world application on personalized warfarin dosing. Our work provides a principled approach for incentive-aware recommendation in online preference learning settings.</description>

      <title>Innovations in Cover Song Detection: A Lyrics-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cover songs are alternate versions of a song by a different artist. Long being a vital part of the music industry, cover songs significantly influence music culture and are commonly heard in public venues. The rise of online music platforms has further increased their prevalence, often as background music or video soundtracks. While current automatic identification methods serve adequately for original songs, they are less effective with cover songs, primarily because cover versions often significantly deviate from the original compositions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for cover song detection that utilizes the lyrics of a song. We introduce a new dataset for cover songs and their corresponding originals. The dataset contains 5078 cover songs and 2828 original songs. In contrast to other cover song datasets, it contains the annotated lyrics for the original song and the cover song. We evaluate our method on this dataset and compare it with multiple baseline approaches. Our results show that our method outperforms the baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Better Late Than Never: Formulating and Benchmarking Recommendation Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems play a pivotal role in suggesting items to users based on their preferences. However, in online platforms, these systems inevitably offer unsuitable recommendations due to limited model capacity, poor data quality, or evolving user interests. Enhancing user experience necessitates efficiently rectify such unsuitable recommendation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel and significant task termed recommendation editing, which focuses on modifying known and unsuitable recommendation behaviors. Specifically, this task aims to adjust the recommendation model to eliminate known unsuitable items without accessing training data or retraining the model. We formally define the problem of recommendation editing with three primary objectives: strict rectification, collaborative rectification, and concentrated rectification. Three evaluation metrics are developed to quantitatively assess the achievement of each objective. We present a straightforward yet effective benchmark for recommendation editing using novel Editing Bayesian Personalized Ranking Loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we establish a comprehensive benchmark that incorporates various methods from related fields. Codebase is available at https://github.com/cycl2018/Recommendation-Editing.</description>

      <title>Scaling Automatic Extraction of Pseudocode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudocode in a scholarly paper provides a concise way to express the algorithms implemented therein. Pseudocode can also be thought of as an intermediary representation that helps bridge the gap between programming languages and natural languages. Having access to a large collection of pseudocode can provide various benefits ranging from enhancing algorithmic understanding, facilitating further algorithmic design, to empowering NLP or computer vision based models for tasks such as automated code generation and optical character recognition (OCR). We have created a large pseudocode collection by extracting nearly 320,000 pseudocode examples from arXiv papers. This process involved scanning over $2.2$ million scholarly papers, with 1,000 of them being manually inspected and labeled. Our approach encompasses an extraction mechanism tailored to optimize the coverage and a validation mechanism based on random sampling to check its accuracy and reliability, given the inherent heterogeneity of the collection. In addition, we offer insights into common pseudocode structures, supported by clustering and statistical analyses. Notably, these analyses indicate an exponential-like growth in the usage of pseudocodes, highlighting their increasing significance.</description>

      <title>QAGCF: Graph Collaborative Filtering for Q&amp;A Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question and answer (Q&amp;A) platforms usually recommend question-answer pairs to meet users' knowledge acquisition needs, unlike traditional recommendations that recommend only one item. This makes user behaviors more complex, and presents two challenges for Q&amp;A recommendation, including: the collaborative information entanglement, which means user feedback is influenced by either the question or the answer; and the semantic information entanglement, where questions are correlated with their corresponding answers, and correlations also exist among different question-answer pairs. Traditional recommendation methods treat the question-answer pair as a whole or only consider the answer as a single item, which overlooks the two challenges and cannot effectively model user interests. To address these challenges, we introduce Question &amp; Answer Graph Collaborative Filtering (QAGCF), a graph neural network model that creates separate graphs for collaborative and semantic views to disentangle the information in question-answer pairs. The collaborative view disentangles questions and answers to individually model collaborative information, while the semantic view captures the semantic information both within and between question-answer pairs. These views are further merged into a global graph to integrate the collaborative and semantic information. Polynomial-based graph filters are used to address the high heterophily issues of the global graph. Additionally, contrastive learning is utilized to obtain robust embeddings during training. Extensive experiments on industrial and public datasets demonstrate that QAGCF consistently outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>CHIQ: Contextual History Enhancement for Improving Query Rewriting in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how open-source large language models (LLMs) can be effectively deployed for improving query rewriting in conversational search, especially for ambiguous queries. We introduce CHIQ, a two-step method that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to resolve ambiguities in the conversation history before query rewriting. This approach contrasts with prior studies that predominantly use closed-source LLMs to directly generate search queries from conversation history. We demonstrate on five well-established benchmarks that CHIQ leads to state-of-the-art results across most settings, showing highly competitive performances with systems leveraging closed-source LLMs. Our study provides a first step towards leveraging open-source LLMs in conversational search, as a competitive alternative to the prevailing reliance on commercial LLMs. Data, models, and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/fengranMark/CHIQ.</description>

      <title>Corpus Poisoning via Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrievers are widely used in information retrieval and have also been successfully extended to other knowledge intensive areas such as language models, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unfortunately, they have recently been shown to be vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks in which a malicious user injects a small fraction of adversarial passages into the retrieval corpus to trick the system into returning these passages among the top-ranked results for a broad set of user queries. Further study is needed to understand the extent to which these attacks could limit the deployment of dense retrievers in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent (AGGD), a new attack on dense retrieval systems based on the widely used HotFlip method for efficiently generating adversarial passages. We demonstrate that AGGD can select a higher quality set of token-level perturbations than HotFlip by replacing its random token sampling with a more structured search. Experimentally, we show that our method achieves a high attack success rate on several datasets and using several retrievers, and can generalize to unseen queries and new domains. Notably, our method is extremely effective in attacking the ANCE retrieval model, achieving attack success rates that are 17.6\% and 13.37\% higher on the NQ and MS MARCO datasets, respectively, compared to HotFlip. Additionally, we demonstrate AGGD's potential to replace HotFlip in other adversarial attacks, such as knowledge poisoning of RAG systems.\footnote{Code can be find in \url{https://github.com/JinyanSu1/AGGD}}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-item recommender systems are often trained using only positive feedback with randomly-sampled negative feedback. We show the benefits of using real negative feedback both as inputs into the user sequence and also as negative targets for training a next-song recommender system for internet radio. In particular, using explicit negative samples during training helps reduce training time by ~60% while also improving test accuracy by ~6%; adding user skips as additional inputs also can considerably increase user coverage alongside slightly improving accuracy. We test the impact of using a large number of random negative samples to capture a 'harder' one and find that the test accuracy increases with more randomly-sampled negatives, but only to a point. Too many random negatives leads to false negatives that limits the lift, which is still lower than if using true negative feedback. We also find that the test accuracy is fairly robust with respect to the proportion of different feedback types, and compare the learned embeddings for different feedback types.</description>

      <title>GNNAnatomy: Systematic Generation and Evaluation of Multi-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective in various machine learning (ML) tasks involving graphs, such as node/graph classification and link prediction. However, explaining the decisions made by GNNs poses challenges because of the aggregated relational information based on graph structure, leading to complex data transformations. Existing methods for explaining GNNs often face limitations in systematically exploring diverse substructures and evaluating results in the absence of ground truths. To address this gap, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a model- and dataset-agnostic visual analytics system designed to facilitate the generation and evaluation of multi-level explanations for GNNs. In GNNAnatomy, we employ graphlets to elucidate GNN behavior in graph-level classification tasks. By analyzing the associations between GNN classifications and graphlet frequencies, we formulate hypothesized factual and counterfactual explanations. To validate a hypothesized graphlet explanation, we introduce two metrics: (1) the correlation between its frequency and the classification confidence, and (2) the change in classification confidence after removing this substructure from the original graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy, we conduct case studies on both real-world and synthetic graph datasets from various domains. Additionally, we qualitatively compare GNNAnatomy with a state-of-the-art GNN explainer, demonstrating the utility and versatility of our design.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds of Supervised Classification from Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There remains a list of unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL), including the remarkable generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the efficient optimization performance despite the non-convexity, and the mechanisms behind flat minima in generalization. In this paper, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective to explore the theoretical foundations of supervised classification using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our analysis introduces the concepts of fitting error and model risk, which, together with generalization error, constitute an upper bound on the expected risk. We demonstrate that the generalization errors are bounded by the complexity, influenced by both the smoothness of distribution and the sample size. Consequently, task complexity serves as a reliable indicator of the dataset's quality, guiding the setting of regularization hyperparameters. Furthermore, the derived upper bound fitting error links the back-propagated gradient, Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and the model's parameter count with the fitting error. Utilizing the triangle inequality, we establish an upper bound on the expected risk. This bound offers valuable insights into the effects of overparameterization, non-convex optimization, and the flat minima in DNNs.Finally, empirical verification confirms a significant positive correlation between the derived theoretical bounds and the practical expected risk, confirming the practical relevance of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention heads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, synthetic datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in relevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different classes of data stores.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-field B2B Cloud Solution Matching via Contrastive Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud solutions have gained significant popularity in the technology industry as they offer a combination of services and tools to tackle specific problems. However, despite their widespread use, the task of identifying appropriate company customers for a specific target solution to the sales team of a solution provider remains a complex business problem that existing matching systems have yet to adequately address. In this work, we study the B2B solution matching problem and identify two main challenges of this scenario: (1) the modeling of complex multi-field features and (2) the limited, incomplete, and sparse transaction data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework CAMA, which is built with a hierarchical multi-field matching structure as its backbone and supplemented by three data augmentation strategies and a contrastive pre-training objective to compensate for the imperfections in the available data. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that CAMA outperforms several strong baseline matching models significantly. Furthermore, we have deployed our matching framework on a system of Huawei Cloud. Our observations indicate an improvement of about 30% compared to the previous online model in terms of Conversion Rate (CVR), which demonstrates its great business value.</description>

      <title>Cognitively Biased Users Interacting with Algorithmically Biased Results in Whole-Session Search on Debated Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When interacting with information retrieval (IR) systems, users, affected by confirmation biases, tend to select search results that confirm their existing beliefs on socially significant contentious issues. To understand the judgments and attitude changes of users searching online, our study examined how cognitively biased users interact with algorithmically biased search engine result pages (SERPs). We designed three-query search sessions on debated topics under various bias conditions. We recruited 1,321 crowdsourcing participants and explored their attitude changes, search interactions, and the effects of confirmation bias. Three key findings emerged: 1) most attitude changes occur in the initial query of a search session; 2) Confirmation bias and result presentation on SERPs affect the number and depth of clicks in the current query and perceived familiarity with clicked results in subsequent queries; 3) The bias position also affects attitude changes of users with lower perceived openness to conflicting opinions. Our study goes beyond traditional simulation-based evaluation settings and simulated rational users, sheds light on the mixed effects of human biases and algorithmic biases in information retrieval tasks on debated topics, and can inform the design of bias-aware user models, human-centered bias mitigation techniques, and socially responsible intelligent IR systems.</description>

Abstract: We present RLStop, a novel Technology Assisted Review (TAR) stopping rule based on reinforcement learning that helps minimise the number of documents that need to be manually reviewed within TAR applications. RLStop is trained on example rankings using a reward function to identify the optimal point to stop examining documents. Experiments at a range of target recall levels on multiple benchmark datasets (CLEF e-Health, TREC Total Recall, and Reuters RCV1) demonstrated that RLStop substantially reduces the workload required to screen a document collection for relevance. RLStop outperforms a wide range of alternative approaches, achieving performance close to the maximum possible for the task under some circumstances.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning, which directly extracts inherent data correlations from unlabeled data, has been widely utilized to mitigate the data sparsity issue in sequential recommendation. The majority of existing methods create different augmented views of the same user sequence via random augmentation, and subsequently minimize their distance in the embedding space to enhance the quality of user representations. However, random augmentation often disrupts the semantic information and interest evolution pattern inherent in the user sequence, leading to the generation of semantically distinct augmented views. Promoting similarity of these semantically diverse augmented sequences can render the learned user representations insensitive to variations in user preferences and interest evolution, contradicting the core learning objectives of sequential recommendation. To address this issue, we leverage the inherent characteristics of sequential recommendation and propose the use of context information to generate more reasonable augmented positive samples. Specifically, we introduce a context-aware diffusion-based contrastive learning method for sequential recommendation. Given a user sequence, our method selects certain positions and employs a context-aware diffusion model to generate alternative items for these positions with the guidance of context information. These generated items then replace the corresponding original items, creating a semantically consistent augmented view of the original sequence. Additionally, to maintain representation cohesion, item embeddings are shared between the diffusion model and the recommendation model, and the entire framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>It's Not a Modality Gap: Characterizing and Addressing the Contrastive Gap</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal contrastive models such as CLIP achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification by embedding input images and texts on a joint representational space. Recently, a modality gap has been reported in two-encoder contrastive models like CLIP, meaning that the image and text embeddings reside in disjoint areas of the latent space. Previous studies suggest that this gap exists due to 1) the cone effect, 2) mismatched pairs in the dataset, and 3) insufficient training. We show that, even when accounting for all these factors, and even when using the same modality, the contrastive loss actually creates a gap during training. As a result, We propose that the modality gap is inherent to the two-encoder contrastive loss and rename it the contrastive gap. We present evidence that attributes this contrastive gap to low uniformity in CLIP space, resulting in embeddings that occupy only a small portion of the latent space. To close the gap, we adapt the uniformity and alignment properties of unimodal contrastive loss to the multi-modal setting and show that simply adding these terms to the CLIP loss distributes the embeddings more uniformly in the representational space, closing the gap. In our experiments, we show that the modified representational space achieves better performance than default CLIP loss in downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and multi-modal arithmetic.</description>

      <title>XL-HeadTags: Leveraging Multimodal Retrieval Augmentation for the Multilingual Generation of News Headlines and Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millions of news articles published online daily can overwhelm readers. Headlines and entity (topic) tags are essential for guiding readers to decide if the content is worth their time. While headline generation has been extensively studied, tag generation remains largely unexplored, yet it offers readers better access to topics of interest. The need for conciseness in capturing readers' attention necessitates improved content selection strategies for identifying salient and relevant segments within lengthy articles, thereby guiding language models effectively. To address this, we propose to leverage auxiliary information such as images and captions embedded in the articles to retrieve relevant sentences and utilize instruction tuning with variations to generate both headlines and tags for news articles in a multilingual context. To make use of the auxiliary information, we have compiled a dataset named XL-HeadTags, which includes 20 languages across 6 diverse language families. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play multimodal-multilingual retrievers for both tasks. Additionally, we have developed a suite of tools for processing and evaluating multilingual texts, significantly contributing to the research community by enabling more accurate and efficient analysis across languages.</description>
