      <title>Spin-charge separation and resonant valence bond spin liquid in a frustrated doped Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson's groundbreaking ideas of resonant valence bond (RVB) liquid and spin-charge separation initiated a transformative shift in modern physics. Extensive implications influenced a broad spectrum of fields, from high-temperature superconductors to quantum computing, and gave birth to key concepts in physics, such as quantum spin liquids, emergent gauge symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of an RVB phase in the Hubbard model, a definitive realisation has proven elusive. Here, we present a concise, realistic, and elegant solution to this longstanding problem by demonstrating analytically that an RVB spin liquid, exhibiting spin-charge separation, emerges as the ground state of doped Mott insulators on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping near half-filling -- a manifestation of the counter-Nagaoka effect. We confirm numerically that this result holds for finite-size systems, finite dopant density, and small exchange interactions. While much attention has been devoted to the emergence of new states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be pivotal to stabilise robust, topologically ordered states in real materials.</description>

      <title>A Gallery of Soft Modes: Theory and Experiment at a Ferromagnetic Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03510v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy excitations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point in LiHoF$_4$, a physical realization of the Transverse Field Ising Model, focusing on the long-range fluctuations which soften to zero energy at the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. Microwave spectroscopy in tunable loop-gap resonator structures identifies and characterizes the soft mode and higher-energy electronuclear states. We study these modes as a function of frequency and magnetic fields applied transverse and parallel to the Ising axis. These are understood in the context of a theoretical model of a soft electronuclear mode that interacts with soft photons as well as soft phonons. We identify competing infrared divergences at the quantum critical point, coming from the photons and the electronuclear soft mode. It is an incomplete cancellation of these divergences that leads to the muted but distinct signatures observed in the experiments. The application of a longitudinal magnetic field gaps the soft mode. Measurements well away from the quantum critical point reveal a set of ``Walker'' modes associated with ferromagnetic domain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunneling maps, non-monotonic resistivity, and non Drude optics in EuB$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several decades the low carrier density local moment magnet EuB$_6$ has been considered a candidate material for ferromagnetic polarons. There is however no consistent explanation for the host of intriguing observations that have accrued over the years, including a prominently non-monotonic resistivity near $T_c$, and observation of spatial textures, with a characteristic spatial and energy scale, via scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We resolve all these features using a Heisenberg-Kondo lattice model for EuB$_6$, solved using exact diagonalisation based Langevin dynamics. Over a temperature window $\sim 0.7T_c - 1.5T_c$ we observe electronic and magnetic textures with the correct spatial and energy scale, and confirm an associated non-monotonic resistivity. We predict a distinctly `non Drude' optical conductivity in the polaronic phase, and propose a field-temperature phase diagram testable through spin resolved tunneling spectroscopy. We argue that the anomalous properties of EuB$_6$, and magnetic polaron materials in general, occur due to a non monotonic change in spatial character of `near Fermi level' eigenstates with temperature, and the appearance of a weak pseudogap near $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Chirality in the Kagome Metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we study photoemission intensity changes related to changes in the geometric and electronic structure in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ upon transition to an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) state. The XPD patterns reveal the presence of a chiral atomic structure in the CDW phase. Furthermore, using circularly polarized x-rays, we have found a pronounced non-trivial circular dichroism in the angular distribution of the valence band photoemission in the CDW phase, indicating a chirality of the electronic structure. This observation is consistent with the proposed orbital loop current order. In view of a negligible spontaneous Kerr signal in recent magneto-optical studies, the results suggest an antiferromagnetic coupling of the orbital magnetic moments along the $c$-axis. While the inherent structural chirality may also induce circular dichroism, the observed asymmetry values seem to be too large in the case of the weak structural distortions caused by the CDW.</description>

      <title>Hidden elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. We perform ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$. The measurements of these compounds reveal that the symmetry-lowering elastic modes of shear elastic moduli exhibit unusual elastic softness in the paramagnetic phase above $T_N$. This elastic softness indicates the presence of spin-lattice-coupled fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. Furthermore, it is revealed that the magnitude of the unusual elastic softness is larger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$, which indicates that the spin-lattice coupling is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$. The present study suggests that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ are unique spin Jahn--Teller systems with low crystal symmetry, where, although the nature of exchange interactions is quasi-one-dimensional, the three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling releases the frustration by further lowering the crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Manipulable compact many-body localization and absence of superfluidity in geometrically frustrated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is known to completely damage kinetic processes of some of the orbitals (and their associated quantum coherence) as to produce flat bands in the non-interacting systems. The impact of introducing additional interaction to the system in such frustrated systems is, however, a highly controversial issue. On the one hand, numerical studies on geometrically frustrated systems of hard-core boson (equivalent to a spin-1/2 systems) typically lead to glass or solid phases containing only local many-body coherence, indicating the persistence of the damage in quantum coherence. On the other, there continues to be noticeable claims of development of superfluidity that implies kinetic flow of particles. To resolve this apparent contradiction of great significance, we present a rigorous proof showing that density-density interaction is incapable of defeating the geometric frustration to allow propagation of those immobile particles, let alone sustaining a superfluidity. Instead, the frustrated systems develop many $\textit{compact}$ many-body localized states as "many-body scars" that do not thermalize, making them good candidates for storing $\textit{robust}$ and $\textit{manipulable}$ quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Specific heat studies of the Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Mn$_{1-y}$Ti$_y$O$_3$ polycrystalline samples performed by the relaxation and DSC methods over the temperature range 2 - 450 K are reported. Anomalies accompanying the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions were measured and analyzed. The system studied is a promising multiferroic material of the 2$^{\text {nd}}$ type, in which a strong coupling between the magnetic and electric systems can be related to the fact that the same Mn$^{4+}$ ions are responsible for the two orderings. Analysis of the anomaly at the magnetic transition was done by using the advanced theory of the continuous transitions, in which the presence of higher order terms in the free energy is considered, and the parameters of the critical behavior of the system were estimated. It was found that, despite of earlier predictions, the transition loses the continuous character and can become the 1$^{\text {st}}$ order process for the Ti-containing samples. The anomalies accompanying the 1$^{\text{st}}$ order high-temperature ferroelectric transition were found to be hardly visible by using both techniques, which was ascribed to a wide temperature range of coexistence of the dielectric and ferroelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermophotonic Charge Density Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-order states of broken symmetry, such as charge density wave (CDW), are able to induce exceptional physical properties, however, the precise understanding of the underlying physics is still elusive. Here, we combine fluctuational electrodynamics and density functional theory to reveal an unconventional thermophotonic effect in CDW-bearing TiSe$_2$, referred to as thermophotonic-CDW ($tp$-CDW). The interplay of plasmon polariton and CDW electron excitations give rise to an anomalous negative temperature dependency in thermal photons transport, offering an intuitive fingerprint for a transformation of the electron order. Additionally, the demonstrated nontrivial features of $tp$-CDW transition hold promise for a controllable manipulation of heat flow, which could be extensively utilized in various fields such as thermal science and electron dynamics, as well as in next-generation energy devices.</description>

      <title>Doping evolution of the normal state magnetic excitations in pressurized La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The doping evolution behaviors of the normal state magnetic excitations (MEs) of the nickelate La3Ni2O7 are theoretically studied in this paper. For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic fluctuations of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering technique is employed to investigate the paramagnetic spin dynamics in a single crystalline sample of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$. In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\times T_{C}$ to 1.5$\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin fluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model predictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar interactions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that vanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\,K). Based on the characteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we determine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above room temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based magnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.</description>

Abstract: In a series of papers, we have proposed a non-perturbative field-theoretic approach to deal with strong electron-phonon and strong Coulomb interactions. The key ingredient of such an approach is to determine the full fermion-boson vertex corrections by solving a number of self-consistent Ward-Takahashi identities. Palle (see Phys. Rev. B 110, 026501 (2024), arXiv:2404.02918) argued that our Ward-Takahashi identities failed to include some important additional terms and thus are incorrect. We agree that our Ward-Takahashi identities have ignored some potentially important contributions and here give some remarks on the role played by the additional terms.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. When it is cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, which triggers a superfluid transition. Previous works on neutron superfluidity are focused on the finite-temperature transition. Little attention is paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of nuclear density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, there is a strong coupling between the gapless neutrons and the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling by using perturbation theory and renormalization group method, and show that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the Fermi-liquid specific heat $c_{n}\propto T$ and also markedly alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge at a time much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire life of a neutron star. At a low $T$, such phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior, yet occupying different layers. We include superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and find that it obviously prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a variety of neutron stars. Our results indicate the existence of an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We derive Ward identities for fermionic systems exhibiting a gauge symmetry that gets globally broken. In particular, we focus on the relation that connects the gauge field response functions to the transverse susceptibilities of the order parameter. We find that the long-wavelength and zero energy limit of the former are related to the coefficients of a low-energy expansion of the latter. We examine three physical cases: the superconductor, the N\'eel antiferromagnet and the spiral magnet. In the case of a metallic spiral magnet that completely breaks the SU(2) spin symmetry we explicitly show that the Ward identities are fulfilled within the random phase approximation. We subsequently derive microscopic expressions for the spin stiffnesses and spin wave velocities, which can be plugged into low energy models to study the effect of long-wavelength bosonic fluctuations on top of mean-field solutions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Absence of bulk charge density wave order in the normal state of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spatially modulated superconducting state, known as pair density wave (PDW), is a tantalizing state of matter with unique properties. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies revealed that spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ hosts an unprecedented spin-triplet, multi-component PDW whose three wavevectors are indistinguishable from a preceding charge-density wave (CDW) order that survives to temperatures well above the superconducting critical temperature, $T_{c}$. Whether the PDW is the mother or a subordinate order remains unsettled. Here, based on a systematic search for bulk charge order above $T_{c}$ using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS), we show that the structure factor of charge order previously identified by STM is absent in the bulk within the sensitivity of REXS. Our results invite two scenarios: either the density-wave orders condense simultaneously at $T_{c}$ in the bulk, in which case PDW order is likely the mother phase, or the charge modulations are restricted to the surface.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties and surface states of RbNi$_2$Se$_2$</title>

Abstract: Iron-based superconductors, with the ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$-type tetragonal structure (122 family), due to the iron arsenide/selenide layers exhibit several characteristic electronic properties. For example, multiband character mosty associated with the $d$-orbitals of iron and the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) cylindrical Fermi surface. Moreover, external hydrostatic pressure leads to the isostructural phase transition from the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase. In this paper, in relation to the iron-based superconductors, we discuss the electronic properties of novel 122-family member RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ [Liu H. et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 094511 (2022)]. We show that the two Fermi pockets exhibit quasi-2D character. Calculation of the surface spectral function for the (001) surface shows that the surface states are realized independently on the surface termination. Additionally, contrary to the iron-based 122 compounds, RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ exhibits extraordinary multiple isostructural phase transitions under pressure. Moreover, the Lifshizt transition occurs under external pressure, which results into a strong modification of the shapes of the Fermi pockets.</description>

      <title>Topology of chalcogen chains</title>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the helical atomic chains occurring in elemental selenium and tellurium. We postulate a realistic model that includes spin-orbit interaction and show this to be topologically non-trivial, with a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We describe the end-states, which are orbitally polarized, with an orbital density modulation strongly peaked at the edge. Furthermore, we propose a simplified model that decomposes into three orbital chains, allowing us to define a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We contrast this result with recent observations made for the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model containing a $p$-orbital zigzag chain.</description>

      <title>A stabilizer code model with non-invertible symmetries: Strange fractons, confinement, and non-commutative and non-Abelian fusion rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stabilizer code model with a qutrit at every edge on a square lattice and with non-invertible plaquette operators. The degeneracy of the ground state is topological as in the toric code, and it also has the usual deconfined excitations consisting of pairs of electric and magnetic charges. However, there are novel types of confined fractonic excitations composed of a cluster of adjacent faces with vanishing flux. They manifest confinement, and even larger configurations of these fractons are fully immobile although they acquire emergent internal degrees of freedom. Deconfined excitations change their nature in presence of these fractonic defects. As for instance, fractonic defects can absorb magnetic charges making magnetic monopoles exist while electric charges acquire restricted mobility. Furthermore, some generalized symmetries can annihilate any ground state and also the full sector of fully mobile excitations. All these properties can be captured via a novel type of \textit{non-commutative} and \textit{non-Abelian} fusion category in which the product is associative but does not commute, and can be expressed as a sum of (operator) equivalence classes. Generalized non-invertible symmetries give rise to the feature that the fusion products form a non-unital category without a proper identity. We show that a variant of this model features a deconfined fracton liquid phase and a phase where the dual (magnetic) strings have condensed.</description>

      <title>Modular Many-Body Quantum Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems undergoing phase transitions have been proposed as probes enabling beyond-classical enhancement of sensing precision. However, this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow region around the critical point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach for introducing multiple phase transitions in a many-body system. This naturally allows us to enlarge the region of quantum-enhanced precision by encompassing the newly created phase boundaries. Our approach is general and can be applied to both symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking sensors, we show that the newly created critical points inherit the original universality class and a simple total magnetization measurement already suffices to locate them. In topological sensors, our modular construction creates multiple bands which leads to a rich phase diagram. In both cases, Heisenberg scaling for Hamiltonian parameter estimation is achieved at all the phase boundaries. This can be exploited to create a global sensor which significantly outperforms a uniform probe.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Dirac theory from Lindbladian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between dissipative processes of open quantum systems and the non-Hermitian quantum field theory of relativistic fermionic systems. By examining the influence of dissipative effects on Dirac fermions via Lindblad formalism, we elucidate the effects of the coupling of relativistic Dirac particles with the environment. Employing rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the impact of dissipative interactions and find the Lyapunov equation of the relativistic dissipation-driven fermionic system. By use of a thermal ansatz, one finds the solution to the Lyapunov equations in terms of a stationary Wigner distribution. Our results describe a non-hermitian fermionic system and provide valuable insights into dissipative quantum phenomena' fundamental mechanisms in relativistic fermionic systems, advancing our understanding of their behavior in non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Variational approach for the two-body problem in a multiband extended-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a spin-up and a spin-down fermion in a generic tight-binding lattice with a multi-site basis, we investigate the two-body problem using a multiband extended-Hubbard model with finite-ranged hopping and interaction parameters. We derive a linear eigenvalue problem for the entire two-body spectrum, alongside a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the bound states in the form of a self-consistency equation. Our results, based on an exact variational approach, suggest potential applications across various lattice geometries. As an illustration, we apply them to the linear-chain model and show that the resultant spin singlet and triplet bound states align well with the existing literature.</description>
