      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. This is especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Pair-Alfv\'en Shocks with PIC Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the recently discovered \emph{pair-Alfv\'en shock wave} occurring in collisionless electron-positron plasmas. We perform a series of Particle-In-Cell studies in one and two dimensions in order to determine the stability conditions for such a shock and the mechanisms which sustain its growth. Building on our previous simulations, which established that these shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming Alfv\'enic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated Alfv\'en waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfv\'en speed, is sufficiently small, $\omega_c \lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units). Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a resonance between the Alfv\'en wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma, which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence of this type of shock identified previously.</description>

      <title>Search for seasonal variations of the horizontal muon rate with the HAWC observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory was designed to study gamma-ray sources in the energy range between a few hundred GeV up to few hundred TeV. It is composed of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) that cover a surface of approximately 22000 m${}^2$, at 4100 m a.s.l. In this study, we use the HAWC WCDs as a very large horizontal particle tracker, searching for horizontal muon rate variations by season using 1.5 years of HAWC data. We look for a possible correlation between the effective temperature and the horizontal muon rate. In order to do this, we developed a method to calculate the effective temperature for the horizontal propagation of muons. This is the first time that a search for seasonal variations in the high-altitude horizontal muon rate is reported.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Spectral Break or Curvature in the Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos from 5\,TeV--10\,PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report improved measurements of the all flavor astrophysical neutrino spectrum with IceCube by combining complementary neutrino samples in two independent analyses. Both analyses show evidence of a harder spectrum at energies below $\sim$30~TeV compared to higher energies where the spectrum is well characterized by a power law. The spectrum is better described by a log parabola or a broken power law, the latter being the preferred model. Both, however, reject a single power law over an energy range 5~TeV-10~PeV with a significance $&gt;4\sigma$, providing new constraints on properties of cosmic neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Improved measurements of the TeV--PeV extragalactic neutrino spectrum from joint analyses of IceCube tracks and cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory has discovered the presence of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux at energies of TeV and beyond using neutrino induced muon tracks and cascade events from neutrino interactions. We present two analyses sensitive to neutrino events in the energy range \SI{1}{TeV} to \SI{10}{PeV}, using more than 10 years of IceCube data. Both analyses consistently reject a neutrino spectrum following a single power-law with significance $&gt;4\,\sigma$ in favor of a broken power law. We describe the methods implemented in the two analyses, the spectral constraints obtained, and the validation of the robustness of the results. Additionally, we report the detection of a muon neutrino in the MESE sample with an energy of $11.4^{+2.46}_{-2.53} $\,\si{PeV}, the highest energy neutrino observed by IceCube to date. The results presented here show insights into the spectral shape of astrophysical neutrinos, which has important implications for inferring their production processes in a multi-messenger picture.</description>

      <title>Darksuite: an Algorithm for Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Measuring the Pion-Air Cross Section at Multi-TeV Energies Using Muon Bundle Properties in Deep Underground Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction cross section of charged pions with air nuclei is a critical parameter for accurately simulating extensive air showers. Improving the modeling of high-energy pion interactions is essential for addressing the muon puzzle-the observed deficit of muons in simulations compared to indirect experimental estimates. As collider experiments cannot directly probe these interactions, we propose a novel measurement approach using muon bundles detected in deep-underground water Cherenkov detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT. This method aims to constrain the pion-air inelastic cross section, thereby reducing uncertainties in air shower simulations and advancing our understanding of cosmic ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Low Angular Momentum Black Hole Accretion: First GRMHD Evidence of Standing Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of low angular momentum accretion flow around black holes (BHs) is essential for probing extreme plasma behavior in strong gravity, where shock formation can naturally produce variability signatures. In this paper, we perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows onto a BH with different BH spins to investigate the accretion dynamics near the central BH region. The simulation results show the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime in all cases. In particular, we report the formation and persistence of standing shocks in low-angular-momentum accretion flows using multi (two and three)-dimensional GRMHD simulations for the first time. Previous studies did not detect such stable standing shock structures, making our findings a significant advancement in this field. The finding of shock dynamics can be further associated with some radiation features, such as flares observed in Sgr~A$^\ast$ and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals detected in some XRBs and AGNs.</description>

      <title>Filamentation of the electromagnetic precursor in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.</description>

      <title>Identification and photometric classification of extragalactic transients in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a ComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degree each, provides a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey and Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Burst from Bremsstrahlung in Milky Way Can Discover Sub-Solar Dark Matter in Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.</description>

      <title>The orbital period changes for novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variable (CVs) are close interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes materials from a low mass main sequence companion. CVs can experience nova eruptions due to low mass transfer rates. In the standard theory of CV evolution, the ejected materials during nova eruptions are assumed to leave the system in the form of fast, isotropic, optically thick winds, which predicts that novae only result in positive variation (expansion) of orbital period (i.e. positive $\Delta P$). In addition, the angular momentum losses (magnetic braking and gravitational radiation) only predicts a steady long-term decay in the orbital period of CVs, i.e. $\dot P$ is negative. Interestingly, an observation lasting over 30 years reveals positive and negative values for both $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ in CVs, strongly conflicting with the standard evolutionary patterns. However, it cannot be excluded that these observations originate from short-term phenomena caused by nova eruptions because of a short timescale of observations. In this paper, we model the effect of instantaneous nova eruptions on the evolution of CVs, considering three mechanisms associated with mass loss in nova eruptions, including fast wind, Frank jet and binary-driven mass loss. By assuming that the observed $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ are dominated by short-term phenomena, our results show that the binary-driven mass loss can explain almost all of the observations of normal CVs. However, the Frank jet may be needed for some of long-period CVs with evolved companions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Confined Circumstellar Material as a Dust Formation Site in Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.</description>

      <title>The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for GW200208\_22 with Targeted Eccentric Numerical-relativity Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed LVK gravitational wave events that show some evidence of eccentricity from TEOBResumS modeling parameter estimations and have confronted them independently with full numerical generated waveforms from our bank of nearly two thousand simulations of binary black holes. We have used RIFT for Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208\_{22} KDE estimates favor eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at $\sim20$Hz within a 90\% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz, $e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.</description>

      <title>From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the gravitational collapses of rotating stellar systems accounting for Gamma-Ray Burst jet progenitors. Based on the virial theorem of hadron collisional relaxations and Newtonian slow-rotating approximation, we analyze the conversion of gravitational binding energy into kinetic energy of hadrons, whose collisions produce photons and electron-positron pairs forming fireballs. Our qualitative analysis implies that rotation effects collimated and spinning fireballs with nontrivial angular momenta along the propagating direction, thus making ultra-relativistic jets. Results reveal the possible trends that the fireball becomes more collimated and the jet angle decreases as the total angular momentum and mass ratio $J/M$ of the slow-rotating collapsing core increases. Discussing the extrapolation of these trends to fast-rotating collapsing systems, we speculate that the ratio $J/M$ should be a key quantity for differentiating long bursts (massive core collapses) from short bursts (binary coalescence). We derive the intrinsic correlations of collimated fireball quantities that should be imprinted on a large sample of observed GRB data as empirical correlations.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>

Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Black Holes as Sources of High-Energy Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, the idea that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly relevant for systems with a large information storage capacity, such as black holes. In these objects, the evaporation process halts, at the latest, once approximately half of the initial mass has been radiated away. As a result, light primordial black holes (PBHs) with mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$, which are traditionally assumed to have fully evaporated by the present time, may instead survive and constitute viable dark matter candidates. Ongoing mergers of such PBHs would give rise to ``young'' black holes that resume their evaporation, emitting ultrahigh-energy particles potentially detectable by current experiments. The resulting emission spectrum would be thermal across all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinctive signature. We demonstrate that, if the memory burden effect activates after PBHs have lost around half of their initial mass, current measurements of the neutrino flux at Earth place strong constraints on such dark matter candidates for $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$. This suggests that the memory burden must set in at earlier stages of evaporation. Unlike existing bounds, our results depend solely on the mass of the remnant, and not on model-dependent details of the stabilized phase. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through observations of gamma rays, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Cloudy and the High-Resolution Microcalorimeter Revolution: Optical, UV, and X-ray Spectra of One-electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the launch of the XRISM microcalorimeter mission, space-based X-ray observations will achieve a record spectral resolving power of $R\equiv E/\Delta E\sim$1200. With this resolving power, emission features associated with fine-structure energy levels of some species will be resolved, sometimes for the first time. The plasma code, Cloudy, was not originally designed for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and throughout its history did not resolve fine-structure components of Lyman lines. Here we expand Cloudy to resolve these fine-structure energy levels and obtain predicted X-ray spectra that match the resolution of new microcalorimeter observations. We show how the Lyman lines can be used as column density indicators in the hot X-ray emitting gas in a cluster of galaxies such as Perseus, and examine their sensitivity to external radiation fields and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Most Extreme Gamma-Ray Blazars Using Broadband Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme high-synchrotron peaked blazars (EHSPs) are rare high-energy sources characterised by synchrotron peaks beyond 10$^{17}$ Hz in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Their extreme properties challenge conventional blazar emission models and provide a unique opportunity to test the limits of particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in relativistic jets. However, the number of identified EHSPs is still small, limiting comprehensive studies of their population and characteristics. This study aims to identify new EHSP candidates and characterise their emission properties. A sample of 124 $\gamma$-ray blazars was analysed, selected for their high synchrotron peak frequencies and $\gamma$-ray emission properties, with a focus on sources showing low variability and good broadband data coverage. Their SEDs were constructed using archival multi-wavelength data from the SSDC SED Builder service, supplemented with recent Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. The SEDs were modelled with a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron-self-Compton framework, classifying sources by synchrotron peak frequency. We identify 66 new EHSP candidates, significantly expanding the known population. A clear correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and the magnetic-to-kinetic energy density ratio is found, with the most extreme EHSPs nearing equipartition. Host galaxy emission is detected in many sources, but no significant differences are observed between elliptical and lenticular hosts. Our analysis suggests that nine high-synchrotron peaked/EHSPs could be observed by CTAO at $&gt;5\sigma$ (20 at $&gt;3\sigma$) in 20-hour exposures, indicating that while the overall detection rate remains modest, a subset of these sources is within reach of next-generation very-high-energy gamma-ray instruments.</description>

      <title>H I absorption line and anomalous dispersion in the radio pulses of PSR B1937+21</title>

Abstract: We use the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope to observe the bright millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21 (J1939+2134) and record the data in the band from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz. We measure the neutral hydrogen (HI) emission and absorption lines near 1420 MHz ($\lambda \simeq 21$ cm). We derive the kinematic distance of the pulsar with the HI observation. By comparing this with the archival absorption spectra observed decades ago, we notice possible variations in the absorption spectra toward this pulsar, which correspond to a possible tiny-scale atomic structure of a few astronomical units in size. We also verify the apparent faster-than-light anomalous dispersion at the HI absorption line of this pulsar previously reported.</description>

      <title>Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this letter, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.</description>

      <title>Probing the polarized emission from the accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1907+09 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of the accretion-powered X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1907+09, conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) that delivers the first high-quality polarization measurements of this source. 4U 1907+09 was observed twice during its brightest periods close to the periastron. We observe a stronger polarization in the first observation, with the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) of $6.0 \pm 1.6\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $69^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. In contrast, the second observation provides weaker constraints on the polarimetric properties, with a PD=$2.2 \pm 1.6\%$ and a PA=$46^\circ \pm 23^\circ$, as determined from the spectral-polarimetric analysis. Combining the data from both observations results in a PD=$3.7 \pm 1.1\%$ and a PA=$63^\circ \pm 9^\circ$. We detect an energy-dependent PA in the phase-averaged analyses with a significance of 1.7 $\sigma$. In the phase-resolved analyses, we observe a potential PA rotation by approximately $90^\circ$ between adjacent energy bands (4--5 and 5--6 keV) within the single phase bin of 0.25--0.375. We also investigate the influence of short flares on the polarization properties of this source. The results suggest that flares do not significantly affect the energy-phase-dependent PA, implying that the pulsar's geometry remains stable during flare events.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Astrophysical Neutrino Flux Using Contained and Uncontained Cascade Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor ~3 gain in effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined tracks and cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic improvements and rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino background is incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained cascade event selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum across energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.</description>

      <title>From Equipartition to Curvature: The Spectral Evolution of 4FGL Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.</description>

      <title>Properties of neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars from a pion mean-field approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the static neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars, based on the equations of state derived from a pion mean-field approach. Using the empirical data on the pion-nucleus scattering and bulk properties of nuclear matter, we have already fixed all the parameters in a previous work, where the nucleons and hyperons were shown to be modified in various nuclear medium. In the current work, we first examine the energy and pressure inside a neutron star. We show that the central densities in various neutron stars vary within the range of $(3-4)\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density. The mass-radius relations are obtained and discussed. As the slope parameter for neutron matter increases, the radii of the neutron stars increase with their masses fixed. We also study the strangeness-mixed stars or the hyperon stars using the same sets of the parameters. As the strangeness content of strange matter increases, the binding energy per nucleon is saturated and the corresponding equation of state becomes softened. Consequently, the central densities of the strangeness-mixed stars increase. Assuming that recently observed neutron stars are the strangeness-mixed ones, we find that the central densities increase.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this \textit{letter}, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal scenario where the SHDM decays to neutrino and SM Higgs. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass, ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits, and the observed KM3-230213A event, along with the gamma-ray constraints. We find that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on the DM mass ranging from $1.5\times10^8$ GeV to $5.2\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime in the range: $1.42\times10^{30}$ s to $5.4\times10^{29}$ s. Remarkably, in our SHDM scenario, the apparent tension between the KM3NeT observation and the non-observation of this event by IceCube and Auger can be reduced to below $1.2\sigma$. Our results are applicable to any neutrinophilic SHDM models while evading gamma-ray constraints.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

      <title>BASS LII: The prevalence of double-peaked broad lines at low accretion rates among hard X-ray selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z&lt;0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.</description>

Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.</description>
