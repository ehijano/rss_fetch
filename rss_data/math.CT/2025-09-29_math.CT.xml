      <title>The Morita $(\infty,2)$-category of a monoidal category as a $2$-complicial set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit and elementary construction of the Morita $(\infty,2)$-category of a monoidal category which satisfies minimal conditions. We construct it as a $3$-coskeletal $2$-complicial set, in which the vertices encode the monoids, the edges encode the bimodules, the triangles encode the bimodule maps out of a balanced tensor product, and tetrahedra encode composition of bimodule maps. The marked edges encode invertible bimodules, and the marked triangles encode bimodule isomorphisms with a balanced tensor product.</description>

      <title>Galois Connections and Preradicals in Abelian Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define operations of preradicals of any abelian category. We define idempotent preradicals and radicals. We prove that every adjoint pair between abelian categories induces a Galois connection between the corresponding ordered collections of preradicals. If the abelian categories are bicomplete, we construct alpha and omega preradicals and study their respective preservation under the Galois connection. If a bicomplete abelian category is in addition locally small, then the corresponding collection of preradicals is a complete lattice. The Galois connection induced by an adjoint pair between locally small bicomplete abelian categories preserves, respectively, idempotent preradicals and radicals.</description>

      <title>Parametric Distributive Laws: uniform monad composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monads play an important role in both the syntax and semantics of modern functional programming languages. The problem of combining them has been of profound interest at least since the 90s, and different approaches have been employed to tackle it: currently, the most prevalent notion is that of monad transformers. We provide a novel abstract framework to describe such "compositions" which we call parametric distributive laws. Our description of this framework hinges on the theory of 2-categories and relies strongly on the construction of a left (1-) adjoint to the construction of monads internal to a 2-category: since distributive laws are monads in monads, we obtain a semi-strict "walking distributive law" by Gray-tensoring the walking monad with itself. By Gray-tensoring again, we can then construct a parametric variant thereof. We demonstrate the applicability of such a framework by providing two concrete examples (involving the Writer and Either monads), explicitly describing morphisms of such parametric distributive laws, and showing how (an iterated version of) our construction can be employed to describe (parametric) iterated distributive laws, motivating the appearance of the Yang-Baxter equations as coherences between the distributive laws involved.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal extensions and graph cobordisms between finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and a space $X$, we address the problem of explicitly describing the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category freely obtained from $\mathcal{C}$ by adjoining $X$ new $n$-morphisms with prescribed sources and targets. We develop an apparatus of tools that allow one to detect in concrete situations such a free symmetric monoidal extension. As motivating application, we introduce a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category ${\mathbb{G}\mathrm{r}}$ of graph cobordisms between finite sets, following classical constructions of Gersten, Culler--Vogtmann and Hatcher--Vogtmann, and we exhibit it as an extension of the symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathrm{Fin}$ of finite sets, obtained by freely adjoining a specific list of new 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms. We recover results of Barkan--Steinebrunner and of Galatius.</description>

      <title>Double Categories of Open Systems: the Cospan Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an overview of double categories of "open systems": systems that can interact with their environment. We focus on the variable sharing paradigm, where we compose open systems by identifying variables. This paradigm is often implemented using structured or decorated cospans. We explain this approach using three main examples: open Petri nets, open dynamical systems, and open Petri nets with rates. We compare the virtues of structured and decorated cospan double categories, and study their common features. We show that any symmetric monoidal structured or decorated cospan double category comes with maps from two simpler double categories: its "exoskeleton" and its "outer shell". Finally, we study the concept of "hypergraph double category", a kind of double category that should subsume structured and decorated cospans in a common framework for studying open systems in the variable sharing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Coassociative structures on self-injective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general finite-dimensional self-injective algebra $A$ we construct a family of injective coassociative coproducts $A\to A\otimes A$, all $A$-bimodule morphisms. In particular such structures always exist, confirming a conjecture of Hernandez, Walton and Yadav. The coproducts are indexed by subsets of $\{1,\cdots,m(i)\}\times \{1,\cdots,m(\nu^{-1}i)\}$, where $A\cong \mathrm{End}_{\Lambda}(M)$ is the general form of a self-injective algebra in terms of a basic Frobenius $\Lambda$, the $m(i)$, $1\le i\le n$ are the multiplicities of the indecomposable projective $\Lambda$-modules in $M$, and $\nu$ is the Nakayama permutation of $\Lambda$. We also characterize those among the coproducts introduced in this fashion, in terms this combinatorial data, which are counital.</description>

      <title>Models for rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, which are $(\infty, 1)$-categories enriched in spaces whose higher homotopy groups are rational vector spaces. We provide two models for rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, rational complete Segal spaces and rational Segal categories, and we show that they are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Homological invariant properties under cleft extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the Gorenstein weak global dimension under a cleft extension of rings; we prove that under some mild conditons the finiteness of the Gorenstein weak global dimension is invariant. Moreover, we compare the relative singularity categories with respect to flat-cotorsion modules under a cleft extension of rings. Some applications to {\theta}-extensions and Morita context rings are given.</description>

      <title>Equivalence via surjections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many types of categorical structure obey the following principle: the natural notion of equivalence is generated, as an equivalence relation, by identifying $A$ with $B$ when there exists a strictly structure-preserving map $A \to B$ that is genuinely (not just essentially) surjective in each dimension and faithful in the top dimension. We prove this principle for four types of structure: categories, monoidal categories, bicategories and double categories. The last of these theorems suggests that the right notion of equivalence between double categories is Campbell's gregarious double equivalence, a conclusion also reached for different reasons in recent work of Moser, Sarazola and Verdugo.</description>
