      <title>Study of the Diffusion Map method in the context of social science data sets -- as an example for spectral dimensionality reduction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Diffusion Map is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used to analyze high-dimensional data, with recent applications extending to datasets from the social sciences. Previous research has given little attention to how the specific characteristics of these datasets might influence the results of the Diffusion Map and what conditions must be met for the Diffusion Map to yield meaningful and interpretable results. Moreover, there is a lack of clear, comprehensive explanations of the fundamental principles, which has led to misunderstandings in the literature.
  This work first addresses the fundamental principles of the Diffusion Map and compares them with other spectral methods. It investigates the impact of the Diffusion Map parameters as well as the structure of the underlying data on the results. The V-Dem democracy dataset, British census data, and data on German urban and rural districts are then analyzed, considering their possible natural parameters. A focus is placed on the benefits of the Diffusion Map in comparison to the established linear principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis shows that the time parameter t of the Diffusion Map framework has no significant influence on the analysis. In contrast, discrete and redundant variables, as well as the scaling and normalization of the data, have a substantial impact. Unlike PCA, the Diffusion Map eigenspectrum does not provide a clear indication of which components are important. Therefore, typical polynomial patterns related to one-dimensional datasets within the Diffusion Map framework are explored.
  The thesis presents insights suggesting that several underconsidered effects need further examination, and emphasizes the need for a framework to accurately analyze complex datasets using the Diffusion Map.</description>

      <title>Does Extending Polling Hours Compensate for Bomb Threats? Evidence from the 2024 Election in Georgia, USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least 227~bomb threats against polling places and tabulation centers were received on the day of the 2024 US presidential election. Threats disrupted voting in the swing states of Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania while law enforcement swept polling places. No bombs were found. Roughly a dozen `credible' threats were received in Georgia in DeKalb and Fulton counties, interrupting voting at eleven polling locations; there were dozens of `non-credible' threats in addition. To remediate the effect of the temporary closures of polling places, courts ordered some polling places to remain open late. Nonparametric statistical tests using turnout data from 2020 and 2024 show that this remedy may have been inadequate: in DeKalb, 2024 in-person turnout in precincts closed by threats relative to 2020 turnout in the same precincts was suppressed compared to other DeKalb polling places ($P \approx 0.01$). In Fulton, there is no statistical evidence that in-person voting was suppressed in precincts closed by bomb threats.</description>

      <title>Calibration and uncertainty quantification of macroscopic fundamental diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion occurs as travel demand exceeds network capacity, necessitating a thorough understanding of network capacity for effective traffic control and management. The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) provides an efficient framework for quantifying network capacity. However, empirical MFDs exhibit considerable data scatter and uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a mathematical program that simultaneously calibrates the MFD and quantifies the uncertainty associated with data scatter. We further investigate contributing factors of uncertainties regarding network capacity and traffic resilience. To be specific, we first include two conventional approaches for MFD calibration and uncertainty quantification as special cases. The proposed program is validated using empirical data from two cities in China. Subsequently, we identify how congestion loading and recovery contribute to data scatter. We develop a novel uncertainty quantification approach capable of capturing distinct congestion phases simultaneously. The gap between the upper and lower bounds of the calibrated MFDs, represented by a coefficient parameter, is regarded as the capacity drop induced by traffic congestion. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables further exploration of how macroscopic factors, such as travel demand and traffic control, and microscopic factors, such as driving behavior, influence MFD hysteresis, uncertainty, and traffic resilience. These findings shed light on developing efficient traffic control and demand management strategies to increase network capacity and resilience, while we count on future connected automated vehicular technologies to conquer the influence of various driving behaviors.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy and ranking in pairwise sports contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking athletes by their performance in competitions and tournaments is common in every popular sport and has significant benefits that contribute to both the organization and strategic aspects of competitions. Although rankings are perhaps the most concise and most straightforward representation of the relative strength among the competitors, beyond this one-dimensional characterization, it is also possible to capture the relationships between athletes in greater detail. Following this approach, our study examines the networks between athletes in individual sports such as tennis and fencing, where the nodes are associated with the contestants and the edges are directed from the winner to the loser. We demonstrate that the connections formed through matches arrange themselves into a time-evolving hierarchy, with the top players positioned at its apex. The structure of the resulting networks exhibits detectable differences depending on whether they are constructed purely from round-robin data or from purely elimination-style tournaments. We find that elimination tournaments lead to networks with a smaller level of hierarchy and thus, importantly, to an increased probability of circular win-loss situations (cycles). The position within the hierarchy, along with other network metrics, can be used to predict match outcomes. In the systems studied, these methods provide predictions with an accuracy comparable to that of forecasts based on official sports ranking points or the Elo rating system. A deeper understanding of the delicate aspects of the networks of pairwise contests enhances our ability to model, predict, and optimize the behaviour of many complex systems, whether in sports tournaments, social interactions, or other competitive environments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Classical Two-phase and Kerner Three-phase Traffic Flow Theories: A Comparison of Pre-crash and Normal Traffic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to develop statistical and artificial intelligence-based models for predicting short-term crash probabilities using fundamental traffic flow variables and their associated descriptive statistics and mathematical transformations. However, there has been limited exploration into whether and how the fundamental relationships within traffic flow theories vary between pre-crash and normal traffic conditions. This study reevaluates four classical two-phase traffic flow theories and employs two methods from Kerner's three-phase traffic flow theory to compare their characteristics in the context of pre-crash and normal traffic conditions. The investigation is centered around the Shibuya 3 and Shinjuku 4 routes within the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. Data from both crashes and detectors was collected over a six-month period, spanning from March 2014 to August 2014. The findings reveal that data from the nearest downstream detectors to the crash locations provided a superior fit for pre-crash data compared to the upstream detectors. Notably, a noticeable decrease in goodness-of-fit was observed when compared to normal traffic conditions. In pre-crash scenarios, wide-moving jams exhibited a faster propagation from downstream to upstream, distinct from the patterns observed in normal traffic conditions. Furthermore, pre-crash data displayed a higher standard deviation in the calculated wide-moving jam velocities compared to normal traffic conditions. These insights have the potential to be highly valuable in the development of predictive crash models and in the estimation of traffic volumes on freeways across various timeframes, accounting for both free-flow and congested traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Economic Complexity of the Roman Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic complexity is a powerful tool to estimate the productive capabilities and future growth of modern economies. Little is known of how economic complexity evolves over long periods in history. In this paper, we use archaeological evidence from the Roman Empire in the form of short texts preserved on a durable material (i.e. inscriptions) to estimate the economic complexity of the various provinces of the empire. By connecting the occupations listed in the text of inscriptions with the location in which the inscribed objects were found we can estimate that the most complex areas during the first four centuries of the Roman Empire have a remarkable and statistically significant overlap with the most complex countries today. While we lack an explanation for the reason of the preservation of economic complexity through the ages, this evidence provides a suggestion about how difficult the development of economic capabilities might be.</description>

      <title>Structural Decomposition of Moran's Index by Getis-Ord's Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moran's index and Getis-Ord,s indices are important statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation analysis. Each of them has its own function and scope of application. However, the association of Moran index with Getis-Ord index is not clear. This paper is devoted to deriving and verify the relationships between Moran's index and Getis-Ord's indices using mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. Getis-Ord's indices are employed to decompose Moran's index. The results show that there is a strict nonlinear relationship between Moran's index and Getis-Ord's indices. Moran's index consists of four components: global Getis-Ord's index, sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, number of elements, and size correlation function. Thus the mathematical structure of Moran's index is revealed. A theoretical discovery is that the characteristics of spatial autocorrelation depends on the relationship between the global Getis-Ord's index and the sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, as well as the number of spatial elements. Local Getis-Ord's indices proved to be equivalent to the potential indices based on gravity model. A conclusion can be drawn that Moran's index is related to gravity model, and thus spatial autocorrelation is associated with spatial interaction. This indicates that weak spatial interaction leads to not significant spatial autocorrelation. The conclusion is supported by observational data. This study not only helps to better understand the basic statistics of spatial analysis, but also contributes to the further development of spatial autocorrelation theory.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Estimating Quadratic Logistic Model Parameters of Fractal Dimension Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractal dimension curves of urban form and growth fall into two categories: One can be described by common logistic function, and the other can be described with quadratic logistic function. The approach to estimating the parameter of the ordinary logistic model has been developed. However, how to estimate the parameter of quadratic logistic model is still a problem. This paper is devoted to finding a nonlinear regressive approach for estimating parameter values of quadratic logistic model of fractal dimension curves. The process can be summarized as below. First, differentiating quadratic logistic function in theory with respect to time yields a growth rate equation of fractal dimension. Second, discretizing the growth rate equation yields a nonlinear regressive model of fractal dimension curve. Third, applying the least squares method to the nonlinear regressive equation yields the capacity parameter value of the quadratic logistic model. Fourth, substituting the capacity parameter value into the quadratic logistic model and changing it into a quasilinear form, we can estimate the other parameter values by ordinary linear regression analysis. In this way, a practical quadratic logistic model of fractal dimension curves can be gained. The approach is applied to multifractal dimension curves of Beijing city to show its effectiveness. The method can be extended to estimate the parameter values of quadratic logistic models in many fields besides urban science.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: Integrating Material Needs of Energy Technologies into Energy System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a climate-neutral energy system demands large-scale renewable generation expansion, which requires substantial amounts of bulk materials like steel, cement, and polymers. The production of these materials represents an additional energy demand for the system, creating an energy-material feedback loop. Current energy system models lack a complete representation of this feedback loop. Material requirements of energy system transformation have been studied in a retrospective approach, not allowing them as a consideration in system design. To address this gap, we integrate bulk material demand and production as endogenous factors into energy system optimization using PyPSA-Eur. Our approach links infrastructure expansion with industrial energy needs to achieve a minimum-cost equilibrium. Applying this model to Germany's transition to climate neutrality by 2045, we find that accounting for material needs increases annual bulk material demands by 3-9 %, shifts preferences from solar to wind and from local production of hydrogen to ship imports, and shows distinct industrial process route choices. These findings suggests that energy-material feedbacks should be considered in energy system design when moving to more domestic production of energy technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We offer a collection of videos showing simulations of pedestrian crowds made with the LEMONS software. LEMONS is an open-source computational tool designed for modelling dense crowds. The platform features an intuitive online interface, enabling users to generate 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data. Additionally, it features a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Both the online platform and the library can readily be called from Python scripts, providing users with complete flexibility to implement their own decision-making models, such as specifying the desired velocities of individuals within the crowd.__Documentation is also provided.</description>

      <title>Communicating astrobiology and the search for life elsewhere: speculations and promises of a developing scientific field in newspapers, press releases and papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the communication of astrobiology and the Search for Life Elsewhere (SLE) in academic papers, press releases, and news articles over three decades. Through a quantitative content analysis, it investigates the prevalence of speculations and promises/expectations in these sources, aiming to understand how research results are portrayed and their potential impact on public perception and future research directions. Findings reveal that speculations and promises/expectations are more frequent in news articles and press releases compared to academic papers. Speculations about conditions for life and the existence of life beyond Earth are common, particularly in news articles covering exoplanet research, while promises of life detection are rare. Press releases tend to emphasize the significance of research findings and the progress of the field. Speculations and promises/expectations in news articles often occur without attribution to scientists and in quotes of authors of the studies, and slightly less so in quotes of outside experts. The study highlights the complex dynamics of science communication in astrobiology, where speculations and promises can generate public excitement and influence research funding, but also risk misrepresenting scientific uncertainty and creating unrealistic expectations. It underscores the need for responsible communication practices that acknowledge the speculative dimension of the field while fostering public engagement and informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Curves of Scaling Behavior of Fractal Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The curves of scaling behavior is a significant concept in fractal dimension analysis of complex systems. However, the underlying rationale of this kind of curves for fractal cities is not yet clear. The aim of this paper is at researching a set of basic problems of the scaling behavior curves in urban studies by using mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. The main findings are as follows. First, the formula of scaling behavior curves is derived from a fractal model based on hierarchical structure of urban systems. Second, the relationships between the formula of scaling behavior curves and similarity dimension are revealed. Third, according to the fractal dimension measurement methods, the scaling behavior curves are divided into two different types. Fourth, empirically, 1-dimensional spatial autocorrelation function of scaling behavior curves can be employed to reveal the basic property of scaling behavior curves. The scaling behavior curves can be utilized to evaluate fractal development extent of urban systems and identify scaling ranges of fractal cities. In positive studies, the curves may be used to help distinguish the boundaries between urban areas and rural areas and self-affine fractal structure behind the dynamical process of spatial correlation.</description>

      <title>Travel Time Reliability in Stochastic Kinematic Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the time-dependent relationship between the mean and variance of travel time on a single corridor under rush hour like congestion patterns. To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR ((Lighthill &amp; Whitham, 1955), (Richards, 1956)) theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous bottleneck at its downstream end, assuming a uni-modal demand profile with a stochastic peak. We establish conditions for typical counterclockwise hysteresis loops under these assumptions. It is demonstrated that shapes of the fundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be interpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations may occur under defensive driving. This classification enables a detailed explanation of the qualitative physical mechanisms behind this pattern, as well as an analysis of the causes for quantitatively limited deviations. Some of the mathematical properties of the LWR model identified in our analysis have not yet been addressed in the literature and we critically examine the extent to which these reflect actual traffic flow behavior. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments. The obtained results aim to improve the fundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern and to facilitate its better estimation in traffic planning and control.</description>

      <title>Ranking matters: Does the new format select the best teams for the knockout phase in the UEFA Champions League?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting in the 2024/25 season, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has fundamentally changed the format of its club competitions: the group stage has been replaced by a league phase played by 36 teams in an incomplete round robin format. This makes ranking the teams based on their results challenging because teams play against different sets of opponents, whose strengths vary. In this research note, we apply several well-known ranking methods for incomplete round robin tournaments to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League league phase in order to check the robustness of the official ranking, as well as to call the attention of organizers to the non-trivial issue of ranking in these competitions. Our results show that it is doubtful whether the currently used point-based system provides the best ranking of the teams.</description>

Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while coexistence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry, i.e. the presence of agents who never change state, can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</description>
