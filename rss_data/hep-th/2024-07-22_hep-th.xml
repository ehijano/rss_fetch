      <title>Spoofing Entanglement in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining property of Hawking radiation is that states with very low entanglement masquerade as highly mixed states; this property is captured by a quantum computational phenomenon known as spoofing entanglement. Motivated by the potential implications for black hole information and the emergence of spacetime connectivity, as well as possible applications of spoofing entanglement, we investigate the geometrization of two types of entanglement spoofers in AdS/CFT: so-called EFI pairs and pseudoentangled state ensembles. We show that (a strengthened version of) EFI pairs with a semiclassical bulk dual have a Python's Lunch; the maximally mixed state over the pseudoentangled state ensemble likewise features a Python's Lunch. Since a Python's Lunch must lie behind an event horizon, we find that black holes are the exclusive gravitational source of entanglement spoofing in the semiclassical limit. Finally, we use an extant construction of holographic pseudorandom states to yield a candidate example of a pseudoentangled state ensemble with a semiclassical bulk dual.</description>

      <title>Conformal line defects at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories at finite temperature in the presence of a temporal conformal line defect, wrapping the thermal circle, akin to a Polyakov loop in gauge theories. Although several symmetries of the conformal group are broken, the model can still be highly constrained from its features at zero-temperature. In this work we show that the defect and bulk one and two-point correlators can be written as functions of zero-temperature data and thermal one-point functions (defect and bulk). The defect one-point functions are new data and they are induced by thermal effects of the bulk. For this new set of data we derive novel sum rules and establish a bootstrap problem for the thermal defect one-point functions from the KMS condition. We also comment on the behaviour of operators with large scaling dimensions. Additionally, we relate the free energy and entropy density to the OPE data through the one-point function of the stress-energy tensor. Our formalism is validated through analytical computations in generalized free scalar field theory, and we present new predictions for the O(N) model with a magnetic impurity in the $\varepsilon$-expansion and the large N limit.</description>

      <title>Matter from multiply enhanced singularities in F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometrical structure of multiply enhanced codimension-two singularities in the $SU(5)$ model of six-dimensional F-theory, where the rank of the singularity increases by two or more. We perform blow-up processes for the enhancement $SU(5)\rightarrow G'$, where $G'=E_6$, $E_7$ or $E_8$, to examine whether a sufficient set of exceptional curves emerge that can explain the charged matter generation predicted from anomaly cancelation. We first apply one of the six Esole-Yau small resolutions to the multiply enhanced singularities, but it turns out that the proper transform of the threefold equation does not reflect changes in the singularity or how the generic codimension-two singularities gather there. We then use a(n) (apparently) different way of small resolutions than Esole-Yau to find that, except for the cases of $G'= E_6$ and special cases of $E_7$, either (1) the resolution only yields exceptional curves that are insufficient to cancel the anomaly, or (2) there arises a type of singularity that is neither a conifold nor a generalized conifold singularity. Finally, we revisit the Esole-Yau small resolution and show that the change of the way of small resolutions amounts to simply exchanging the proper transform and the constraint condition, and under this exchange the two ways of small resolutions are completely equivalent.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions in TT-deformed Theories on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of local operators in unitary $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a torus, using their formulation in terms of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We focus on the two-point correlation function in momentum space when the undeformed theory is a conformal field theory. The large momentum behavior of the correlation function is computed and compared to that of $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a plane. For the latter, the behavior found was $|q|^{-\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $q$ is the momentum and $t$ is the deformation parameter. For a torus, the same behavior is found for $|q|&lt;&lt;L/t$, where $L$ is the torus' length scale. However, for $|q|&gt;&gt;L/t$, a different behavior is found: $\left(\frac{4\sqrt{t}^5q^2}{\pi e L^3|T|^2}\right)^{\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $T$ is the modular parameter of the torus. Hence, at large momentum, the correlator decays and then grows. This behavior suggests that operators carrying momentum $q$ are smeared on a distance scale $t|q|$. The difference from the plane's result illustrates the non-locality of the theory and the UV-IR mixing.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability for $\mathcal{N}=0$ quivers and their holographic duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integrability and non-integrability of non-SUSY quivers in 4d that are dual to marginal deformations of Gaiotto-Maldacena geometry in 10d. We explore the dual operator spectrum and the fate of Liouvillian non-integrability both in the presence and the absence of the flavour degrees of freedom. We also comment about the factorised scattering and the associated integrability or non-integrability of the sigma model. Our analysis reveals the mutual compatibility between two seemingly different approaches that has existed in the literature for a long time.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in SB SUSY Gauss-Bonnet inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we explore the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term, incorporating low-scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) potential. The coupling function amplifies the curvature perturbations, consequently leading to the formation of PBHs and the production of detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). Through the adjustment of model parameters, the inflaton can be decelerated during the ultra-slow-roll (USR) phase, thereby augmenting curvature perturbations. Swampland criteria are also investigated. Our computations forecast the formation of PBHs with masses on the order of ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, aligning with observational data from LIGO-Virgo and PBHs with masses ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$, offering potential explanation for ultrashort-timescale microlensing events recorded in OGLE data. Additionally, our proposed mechanism can generate PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, constituting roughly 99$\%$ of the dark matter. The density parameter of produced GWs ($\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$) intersects with the sensitivity curves of GW detectors. Two cases of our model fall within the nano-Hz regime. One of these satisfies the $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}(f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$ fit, with the derived $\gamma = 3.51$ matching the NANOGrav 15-year data.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic tachyons: a new representation of the Galilei group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic characterization of the contractions of the Poincar\'e group permits a proper construction of a non-relativistic limit of its tachyonic representation. We arrive at a consistent, nonstandard representation of the Galilei group which was disregarded long ago by supposedly unphysical properties. The corresponding quantum (and classical) theory shares with the relativistic one their fundamentals, and serves as a toy model to better comprehend the unusual behavior of the tachyonic representation. For instance, we see that evolution takes place in a spatial coordinate rather than time, as for relativistic tachyons, but the modulus of the three-momentum is the same for all Galilean observers, leading to a new dispersion relation for a Galilean system. Furthermore, the tachyonic objects described by the new representation cannot be regarded as localizable in the standard sense.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Higher Dimensional Black Holes as Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center-of-mass energy of two colliding particles could be arbitrarily high in the vicinity of event horizons of the extremal Myers-Perry black holes if the angular momentum of colliding particles is fine-tuned to the critical values. We investigate the maximum efficiency of two colliding particles in four and six dimensions. The efficiency of collision for two particles near the four-dimensional Kerr black holes is 130 %. We show that the efficiency increases to 145 % for collision in six dimensions. We also show that the region for the polar angle in which the particle can reach the high energy is larger when the dimension of space-time increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensionless string on AdS$_3$ is a laboratory to study different aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A particular question addressed in this paper is how the space-time symmetry algebra is encoded on the world-sheet. A natural prescription for calculating the space-time OPEs from the world-sheet is presented in the hybrid formalism. An argument showing that the OPEs are correctly reproduced from the world-sheet is provided, together with a few explicit calculations as consistency checks.</description>

      <title>Euclidean wormholes in holographic RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a one-parameter family of Euclidean wormhole solutions with the topology of a compact hyperbolic space times an interval in Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field in AdS$_{d+1}$ commonly referred to as Einstein-dilaton gravity. These solutions are locally described by the same metric and dilaton profile as the single-boundary Janus domain wall solutions in the same theory which are usually studied in the context of holographic RG flows. The wormholes compute the averaged product of partition functions of CFTs on either boundary deformed by different marginal couplings to the scalar operator dual to the dilaton. We observe that the renormalised volumes of these wormholes increase monotonically with the difference in the marginal couplings on the boundary thereby showing that the pair of CFTs on the boundaries get increasingly decorrelated as the difference in the marginal couplings increases. We use the partition functions of the three-dimensional wormhole solutions to determine the variance of the OPE data of local operators between the marginally deformed 2d CFTs and quantify how the variance decays with the difference in marginal couplings. In addition, a family of wormholes sourced by a thin shell of dust determine how the variance of the matrix elements of the dual line defect decays with the difference in marginal couplings. Applying the GKPW dictionary to wormholes, we compute averages of integrated dilaton correlators treating the wormhole amplitude as a functional of the dilaton sources. We observe that the crossed two-point correlators with a dilaton insertion on either boundary decay montonically with the difference in marginal couplings consistent with the observation that the CFTs increasingly decorrelate as the difference in marginal couplings grows.</description>

      <title>Reading-off the non-geometric scalar potentials with U-dual fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of four-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ type IIB superstring compactifications, the U-dual completion of the holomorphic flux superpotential leads to four S-dual pairs of fluxes, namely $(F, H), (Q, P), (P', Q')$ and $(H', F')$. It has been observed that the scalar potentials induced by such generalized superpotentials typically have an enormous amount of terms, making it hard to study any phenomenological aspects such as moduli stabilization. In this regard, we present a set of generic master formulae which not only formulate the scalar potential in a compact way but also enable one to {\it read-off} the various scalar potential pieces by simply knowing a set of topological data of the compactifying Calabi Yau and its mirror threefold. We demonstrate the applicability of our master formulae by {\it reading-off} the scalar potentials for five explicit models, and using a set of {\it axionic flux} combinations we show that 76276 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2)$-based model can be equivalently expressed by using 2816 terms, while 11212 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a Quintic-based model can be equivalently expressed by 668 terms! We argue that the master formulae presented in this work can be useful in an analytic exploration of the rich landscape of the non-geometric flux vacua.</description>

Abstract: Based on a recently proposed quantum field theory (QFT) for particles with or without structure, called "Structural Algebraic QFT (SAQFT)", we introduce a finite QFT. That is, a QFT for structureless elementary particles that does not require renormalization where loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams are finite. It is an algebraic theory utilizing orthogonal polynomials and based on the structureless sector of SAQFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the corrections to the cosmological models based on the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity induced by the non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion. To determine these corrections, we consider a power-law parametrization of the deviations between the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and the scalar-torsion gravity. The estimates of the possible influence of the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and torsion on the background cosmological parameters and the parameters of cosmological perturbations for the inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of the scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models based on observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new classical fractional particle model incorporating fractional first derivatives. This model represents a natural extension of the standard classical particle with kinetic energy being quadratic in fractional first derivatives and fractional linear momenta, similarly to classical mechanics. We derive the corresponding equations of motion and explore the symmetries of the model. Also, we present the formulation in terms of fractional potentials. Two important examples are analytically solved: the free particle and the particle subjected to generalized forces characterized by fractional first derivatives.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and Flavor in Multi-Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of multi-Higgs doublet extensions of the Standard Model that solves the strong CP problem with profound consequences for the flavor sector. The Yukawa matrices are constrained to have many zero entries by a "Higgs-Flavor" symmetry, $G_{\rm HF}$, that acts on Higgs and quark fields. The violation of both CP and $G_{\rm HF}$ occurs in the Higgs mass matrix so that, for certain choices of $G_{\rm HF}$ charges, the strong CP parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is zero at tree-level. Radiative corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ are computed in this class of theories. They vanish in realistic two-Higgs doublet models with $G_{\rm HF} = \mathbb{Z}_3$. We also construct realistic three-Higgs models with $G_{\rm HF} = \rm U(1)$, where the one-loop results for $\bar{\theta}$ are model-dependent. Requiring $\bar{\theta}&lt; 10^{-10}$ has important implications for the flavor problem by constraining the Yukawa coupling and Higgs mass matrices. Contributions to $\bar{\theta}$ from higher-dimension operators are computed at 1-loop and can also be sufficiently small, although the hierarchy problem of this class of theories is worse than in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell recursion relation for electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the All-Line Transverse (ALT) shift which we developed for on-shell recursion of amplitudes for particles of any mass. We discuss the validity of the shift for general theories of spin $\leq$ 1, and illustrate the connection between Ward identity and constructibility for massive spin-1 amplitude under the ALT shift. We apply the shift to the electroweak theory, and various four-point scattering amplitudes among electroweak gauge bosons and fermions are constructed. We show explicitly that the four-point gauge boson contact terms in massive electroweak theory automatically arise after recursive construction, independent of UV completion, and they automatically cancel the terms growing as (energy)$^4$ at high energy. We explore UV completion of the electroweak theory that cancels the remaining (energy)$^2$ terms and impose unitarity requirements to constrain additional couplings. The ALT shift framework allows consistent treatment in dealing with contact term ambiguities for renormalizable massive and massless theories, which we show can be useful in studying real-world amplitudes with massive spinors.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism: The Boosting Role of Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition. The resulting relic abundance is shown to display a strong dependence on the Lorentz boost factor associated to the bubble wall motion, with this dependence becoming more significant the higher the dimension of the non-renormalizable interaction. This allows for observational compatibility across a wide range of dark matter masses and transition temperatures, typically excluded in renormalizable scenarios. For a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is also within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Gluing together Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Mechanics: a look at the Bell-CHSH inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is revisited by making use of the Hilbert space ${\cal H} \otimes {\cal H}_{AB}$, where ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal H}_{AB}$ stand, respectively, for the Hilbert space of the scalar field and of a generic bipartite quantum mechanical system. The construction of Hermitian, field-dependent, dichotomic operators is devised as well as the Bell-CHSH inequality. Working out the $AB$ part of the inequality, the resulting Bell-CHSH correlation function for the quantum field naturally emerges from unitary Weyl operators. Furthermore, introducing a Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the scalar field and a pair of qubits, the quantum corrections to the Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of the scalar field are evaluated till the second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, employing the exponential corrected entropy (Chatterjee and Ghosh in Phys Rev Lett 125:041302, 2020), we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon and Verlinde's entropic gravity scenario. First, we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics. We investigate the validity of generalised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics and find that it is always satisfied for the all eras of universe. Moreover, we investigate the deceleration parameter for the case $k=0$ in two frameworks. Finally, we numerically study the bouncing behaviour for the modified Friedmann equations obtained from entropic gravity. The results indicate that the bouncing behaviour is possible for the cases $k=1$ and $k=-1$.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of boundary correlation functions for the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze boundary spin correlation functions of the hyperbolic-lattice Ising model from the holographic point of view. Using the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate that the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with quasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays exponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk correlation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that scaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained by the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures inherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of the bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the boundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond dimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Standard Model anomalies and vacuum stability for lepton portals with extra $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Observational and theoretical aspects of Superspinars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article delves into the observational signatures and theoretical underpinnings of rotating astrophysical objects, with a particular focus on superspinars -exotic objects characterized by preventing the formation of event horizons due to their high angular momentum.
  While solutions within General Relativity (Kerr superspinars) predict such objects, their classical forms harbor naked singularities, violate causality, and exhibit problematic repulsive gravitational effects. These characteristics render classical superspinars theoretically objectionable, leading to the consideration of them as physically implausible. On the other hand, the incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics suggests the exploration of alternative models, particularly those in which Quantum Gravity dominates the core, yielding regular superspinars.
  This work demonstrates that regular superspinars avoid all the complications associated with Kerr superspinars. From a phenomenological standpoint, it is shown that the silhouettes of regular superspinars are markedly distinct from those of black holes and classical Kerr superspinars. To substantiate these differences, we perform a comprehensive analysis of inner null geodesics and investigate the structure of the Planckian region within regular superspinars. Our study reveals that only regular superspinars provide the potential for distant observers to directly observe the extremely high curvature regions within their interiors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational tensor and scalar modes in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational waves generated in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity, i.e., a theory of gravity described by a non-metric compatible connection, free of torsion and curvature. It is an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity, equipped with a boundary term $B$. This theory exhibits gravitational waves regardless of the gauge adopted: they are the standard massless tensors plus a massive scalar gravitational wave like in the case of $f(R)$ gravity. It is precisely the boundary term $B$ that generates the massive scalar mode with an effective mass $m_{B}$ associated to a Klein-Gordon equation in the linearized boundary term. As in $f(Q)$ gravity also in $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity, a free test particle follows a geodesic motion due to the covariant conservation with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the energy and momentum densities on shell. Therefore, in $f(Q,B)$ gravity, the proper acceleration between two neighboring worldlines traveled by two free point-like particle is governed by a first-order geodesic deviation equation in the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$. Thanks to this approximate linear equation, $f(Q,B)$ non-metric gravity shows three polarization modes: two massless transverse tensor radiation modes, with helicity equal to 2, reproducing the standard plus and cross modes, exactly as in General Relativity, and an additional massive scalar wave mode with transverse polarization of zero helicity. We obtain the same result both by considering the coincidence gauge and by leaving the gauge free. In summary, three degrees of freedom propagate in the $f(Q,B)$ linearized theory with amplitudes $\tilde{h}^{(+)}$ and $\tilde{h}^{(\times)}$ for tensor modes and amplitude $\tilde{h}^{(s)}$ for the scalar mode. Specifically, both $f(Q,B)$ and $f(R)$ gravity involve the same massive transverse scalar perturbation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of gravitational radiation generated by type D black holes with positive cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The criterion for existence of gravitational radiation at conformal infinity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant is applied to a general family of exact solutions representing generic (pairs of) black holes of algebraic type D. Our analysis shows that only accelerating black holes generate gravitational radiation measurable at infinity. This very satisfactory result confirms the goodness of the criterion. To that end, a new metric form of the family of exact type D black holes is constructed -- including any cosmological constant and a (double-aligned) non-null electromagnetic field -- whose expression is suitable for investigation of the asymptotic structure of this large family of spacetimes. The family depends on seven physical parameters, namely $m$, $a$, $l$, $\alpha$, $e$, $g$, and $\Lambda$ that characterize mass, specific angular momentum parameter, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and the cosmological constant, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric definition of news tensor on null hypersurfaces in four space-time dimensions is presented. When the conformal Einstein field equations hold, this news tensor yields the correct expression for the radiative components of the rescaled Weyl tensor at infinity with vanishing cosmological constant in arbitrary conformal gauge. Also, a generalised transport equation for the Geroch tensor is derived. Important differences between null hypersurfaces in the bulk of the space-time and null infinity with vanishing cosmological constant are reviewed, and their impact on the role of the news is discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This could be tested via second-order GW signals in future observatories, for instance, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET. %. for sneutrino mass $m_{\phi} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $\beta \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring the Kerr--Newman spacetime into the Bondi--Sachs gauge by means of zero angular momentum, null geodesics. We compute the memory effect produced at the black hole horizon by a transient gravitational shock wave, which from future null infinity is seen as a Bondi-Metzner-Sachs supertranslation. This results in a change of the supertransformation charges at infinity between the spacetime geometries defined by the black hole before, and after, the shockwave scattering. For an extremal Kerr--Newman black hole, we give the complementary description of this process in the near-horizon limit, as seen by an observer hovering over the horizon. In this limit, we compute the supertranformation charges and compare them to those calculated at null infinity. We analyze the effect of these transformations on the electromagnetic gauge field and explore the self-interaction between this and the angular momentum of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ecoregions and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the size of ergoregion does not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$, but it can significantly increase at faster spins ($a&gt;0.8$) as the dark matter parameter $\lambda$ decreases, given the electric charge stays within $Q\in [0.2,0.5]$. We identify the optimal conditions for the combination of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that enable efficient energy extraction even when the black hole is not rapidly spinning. The Kerr-Newman black hole in PFDM allows for achieving high energy extraction rates comparable to those of most previously studied rotating black holes, which typically require near-extremal spin to reach similar efficiency levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have calculated the one-loop scattering amplitude of an electron by an external Coulomb potential in QED free of infrared divergences. This feature is achieved by applying the Faddeev-Kulish formalism, which implies a redefinition of both the asymptotic electronic states and of the $S$ matrix. Additionally, we have also derived the infrared-finite one-loop partial-wave amplitudes for this process by applying a recent method in the literature. Next, these partial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by employing three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method, the Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have studied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones to look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound state in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail. This is a wide-ranging method for calculating nonperturbative partial-wave amplitudes for infinite-range interactions that could be applied to many other systems.</description>

      <title>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</description>

Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former unnecessitates the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to\infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

Abstract: String theory with one unit of NS-NS flux on $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ has been recently realised to be the exact dual of the symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4$. In the hybrid formalism of Berkovits, Vafa and Witten and using the free-field realisation of $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)_1$, the DDF operators of the free bosons and the free fermions of $\mathbb{T}^4$ are constructed. It is shown that these DDF operators reproduce the whole spectrum of the space-time theory on the world-sheet and therefore provide a derivation of the dual spectrum from first-principles.</description>

      <title>The Photon Sphere and the AdS/CFT Correspondence</title>

Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence connects bulk fields $\phi$ to boundary operators $\mathcal{O}$ characterized by source frequency $\omega$ and angular momentum $l$. Here we explore their connection to massless particles with an impact parameter $b=\omega/l$. In the AdS Schwarzschild spacetime, these particles follow unstable orbits around the photon sphere -- with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ -- when $b$ is near a critical value. The behavior of the bulk field is obtained numerically and then studied using an analytic approach, which leads to a precise approximate formula for the amplitude of the bulk field $\phi$. This gives the correct qualitative behavior for the system, with the amplitude of the field taking the shape of an arrowhead in tortoise coordinates. The field behaves analogously to the massless particles, and the amplitude of $\phi$ diverges at the critical impact parameter when the source frequency takes the value $\omega \approx \lambda l$, where $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent of the null geodesics. We find this transition occurs when $b = \lambda$. We show this is precisely when the first QNM becomes available, and obtain an approximate formula for the first few overtones.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Path Integral Approach to Symmetries and Soft Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a formulation of the S-matrix in terms of the path integral with specified asymptotic data, as originally proposed by Arefeva, Faddeev, and Slavnov. In the tree approximation the S-matrix is equal to the exponential of the classical action evaluated on-shell. This formulation is well-suited to questions involving asymptotic symmetries, as it avoids reference to non-gauge/diffeomorphism invariant bulk correlators or sources at intermediate stages. We show that the soft photon theorem, originally derived by Weinberg and more recently connected to asymptotic symmetries by Strominger and collaborators, follows rather simply from invariance of the action under large gauge transformations applied to the asymptotic data. We also show that this formalism allows for efficient computation of the S-matrix in curved spacetime, including particle production due to a time dependent metric.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional CFTs with a large central charge, the level-two BPZ equation governs the heavy-light scalar four-point correlator when the light probe scalar has dimension $h= - {1\over 2}$; the corresponding linear ordinary differential equation can be recast into a schematic form $x^2 u_{xx}+u=0$. In this paper, we make an observation that in a class of four-dimensional CFTs with a large central charge, the heavy-light scalar correlator in the near-lightcone limit obeys a similar equation, $x^3 u_{xxxy}+u=0$, when the light scalar has dimension $\Delta=-1$. We focus on the multi-stress tensor sector of the theory and also discuss the corresponding equations for the cases with $\Delta = -2, -3$. The solutions to these linear partial differential equations in higher dimensions are shown, after a suitable change of variables, to reproduce the near-lightcone correlators previously obtained via holography and the conformal bootstrap.</description>

Abstract: We consider continuum formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(N) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly $N_f = 4N$. The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a $\beta$-function that matches the known perturbative result in the weak coupling limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial minimum which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we show the Unruh temperature of the photon sphere for an AdS$_4$-Schwarzschild black hole can be determined holographically from the retarded Green's function and is proportional to its circumference according to a boundary observer. We then sharpen the conjecture that the photon sphere, as seen by a boundary observer, is the spatial Fourier transform of the response function. The conjecture is found to be in excellent agreement with our numerics after certain long-lived excitations -- associated with geodesics traveling between boundary points -- are removed from the response, which is then controlled by the short-lived excitations of the AdS black hole.</description>

Abstract: We survey on-shell and off-shell higher derivative supergravities in dimensions $1\le D\le 11$. Various approaches to their construction, including the Noether procedure, (harmonic) superspace, superform method, superconformal tensor calculus, $S$-matrix and dimensional reduction, are summarized. Primarily the bosonic parts of the invariants and the supertransformations of the fermionic fields are provided. The process of going on-shell, solutions to the Killing spinor equations, typical supersymmetric solutions, and the role of duality symmetries in the context of $R^4, D^4 R^4$ and $D^6 R^4$ invariants are reviewed.</description>

Abstract: We construct the Fermi gas formalism for the partition function of supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories with affine $D$-type quiver diagrams with non-uniform ranks of the gauge groups and Fayet-Illiopoulos parameters by two different approaches: the open string formalism and the closed string formalism. In the closed string formalism approach, we find a novel connection between the partition function of this theory and the partition function of a four-nodes circular quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. We also studied a symmetry of a density matrix appeared in the closed string formalism. We further calculate the exact values of the partition function for finite $N$, with which we identified the exponent of the leading non-perturbative effect in $1/N$ corresponding to the worldsheet instantons in the circular quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation. Hence, the magnetogenesis can be realized in the limited corner of the string landscape due to the ${\cal O}(1)$ value of the coefficient of Chern-Simons coupling.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the averages of conserved densities and currents associated to charges of generic spin in (1+1)-dimensional massive integrable Quantum Field Theories perturbed by the irrelevant $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ operator. By making use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach and of the theory of Generalised Hydrodynamics, we study the non-equilibrium steady state averages of conserved densities and currents in a partitioning protocol. We show that in particular limits, averages can be evaluated exactly in terms of quantities known from the unperturbed theory. In the massless limit we recover known results for the energy and momentum currents and generalise those to any higher spin conserved quantities. We extend some of our results to perturbations of the generalised $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ type. For the massive free fermion theory, we find an analytic expression for the effective inverse temperature after at $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ perturbation in terms of the bare inverse temperature by making use of Lambert's $W$ function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

      <title>Exploring new constraints on Kahler moduli space of 6d N = 1 Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new constraints for 6d (1, 0) supergravity theories based on consistency conditions on the Kahler moduli spaces of their 5d reductions. The requirement that both the metric and the BPS string tensions in the Kahler moduli space are positive imposes specific restrictions on the Chern-Simons coefficients in the 5d effective Lagrangians that are derived from the Kaluza-Klein reductions of 6d theories. Moreover, the emergence of local interacting 5d CFTs when the moduli space metric degenerates introduces additional constraints coming from the analysis of 5d SCFTs. Focusing on the moduli spaces of 6d supergravity theories without a tensor multiplet and their Higgsings, we show that these constraints require the presence of certain primary states in the 2d worldvolume CFTs on 1/2 BPS strings. We specifically analyze a class of SU(2) models and infinite families of U(1) models using these constraints, and demonstrate that the theories featuring a 1-form symmetry in their massless spectra, unless the 1-form symmetry is gauged, fail to satisfy the constraints and therefore belong to the Swampland.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Multi-Stress Tensors in Higher Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs), a system of linear partial differential equations was recently proposed to be the higher-dimensional analog of the null-state equations in $d=2$ CFTs at large central charge. Solving these equations in a near-lightcone expansion yields solutions that match the minimal-twist multi-stress tensor contributions to a heavy-light four-point correlator (or a thermal two-point correlator) computed using holography, the conformal bootstrap, and other methods. This note explores the exact solutions to these equations. We begin by observing that, in an expansion in terms of the ratio between the heavy operator's dimension and the central charge, the $d=2$ correlator involving the level-two degenerate scalars at each order can be represented as a Bessel function; the resummation yields the Virasoro vacuum block. We next observe a relation between the $d=2$ correlator and the $d=4$ near-lightcone correlator involving light scalars with the same conformal dimension. The resummed $d=4$ correlator takes a simple form in the complex frequency domain. Unlike the Virasoro vacuum block, the resummation in $d=4$ leads to essential singularities. Similar expressions are also obtained when the light scalar's dimension takes other finite values. These CFT results correspond to a holographic computation with a spherical black hole. In addition, using the differential equations, we demonstrate that the correlators can be reconstructed via certain modes. In $d=2$, these modes are related to the Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on a new recursive method proposed in arXiv:2312.15484 for computing tree-level $n$-point supergluon amplitudes as well as those with one gluon, i.e., spinning amplitudes, in ${\rm AdS}_5 \times S^3$. We present an improved proof for the so-called "constructibility" of supergluon and spinning amplitudes based on their factorizations and flat-space limit, which allows us to determine these amplitudes in Mellin space to all $n$. We present explicit and remarkably simple expressions for up to $n=7$ supergluon amplitudes and $n=6$ spinning amplitudes, which can be viewed as AdS generalizations of the scalar-scaffolded gluon amplitudes proposed recently. We then reveal a series of hidden structures of these AdS amplitudes including (1) an understanding of general pole structures especially the precise truncation on descendent poles (2) a derivation of simple "Feynman rules" for the all-$n$ amplitudes with the simplest R-symmetry structures, and (3) certain universal behavior analogous to the soft/collinear limit of flat-space amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We develop the thermal shadow formalism to study the conformal blocks decomposition in $D$-dimensional conformal field theory on $\mathbb{S}_{\beta}^{1} \times \mathbb{S}^{D-1}$, where the temperature is $T = \beta^{-1}$. It is demonstrated that both the 1-point thermal ($T\neq 0$) conformal blocks and the 4-point plane ($T=0$) conformal blocks are defined by the same 4-point conformal integral. It is shown that up to power prefactors the 1-point thermal conformal block is given by the fourth Appell function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Gapped boundary of (4+1)d beyond-cohomology bosonic SPT phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study gapped boundary states of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in 4+1d, which are characterized by mixed $\mathbb{Z}_N$-gravity response, and the closely related phases protected by $C_N$ rotation symmetry. We show that if $N\notin \{2,4,8,16\}$, any symmetry-preserving boundary theory is necessarily gapless for the root SPT state. We then propose a (3+1)$d$ $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter as a candidate boundary theory for $N=2,4,8,16$, where the anomalous symmetry is implemented by invertible topological defects obtained from gauging (2+1)$d$ chiral topological superconductors. For the $C_N$ case, we present an explicit construction for the boundary states for $N=2,4,8,16$, and argue that the construction fails for other values of $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>

Abstract: Algebraic quantum field theory is a general mathematical framework for relativistic quantum physics, based on the theory of operator algebras. It comprises all observable and operational aspects of a theory. In its framework the entire state space of a theory is covered, starting from the vacuum over arbitrary configurations of particles to thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. It provides a solid foundation for structural analysis, the physical interpretation of the theory and the development of new constructive schemes. This survey is commissioned by the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, edited by M. Bojowald and R.J. Szabo. It is to be published by the Elsevier publishing house.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the possibility of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solution within the context of the Maxwell-Weyl gauge theory of gravity. To achieve this, we utilize the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory as an analogy and represent the Maxwell gauge field in terms of two time-dependent scalar fields. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, integrating the contributions from the Maxwell gauge fields and an effective cosmological constant that depends on the Dirac scalar field. Our analysis reveals how these modifications influence various cosmological scenarios, including power-law evolution, de Sitter-like expansion, inflationary phases, non-singular bounce cosmologies, and cyclic cosmologies.</description>

Abstract: We prove the integrality and finiteness of open BPS invariants of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds relative to Aganagic-Vafa outer branes, defined from open Gromov-Witten invariants by the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa formula. Specializing to disk invariants, we extend the open/closed correspondence of Gromov-Witten invariants to BPS invariants and prove the integrality of a class of genus-zero BPS invariants of toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, thereby providing additional examples for the conjecture of Klemm-Pandharipande.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy: quasinormal modes, ringdown stability and the pseudospectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the Kerr nature of astrophysical compact objects and their environment. The observation of multiple ringdown modes in gravitational waveforms could soon lead to high-precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy, thus it is critical to understand if the quasinormal mode spectrum itself is affected by astrophysical environments, quantum corrections, and other generic modifications. In this chapter, we will review the black-hole spectroscopy program and its challenges regarding quasinormal mode detection, the overtone status and the recent evidence that supports the existence of nonlinearities in the spectrum of black holes. We will then discuss a newly introduced non-modal tool in black-hole physics, namely the pseudospectrum; a mathematical notion that can shed light on the spectral stability of quasinormal modes, and discuss its novel applications in black holes and exotic horizonless compact objects. We will show that quasinormal modes generically suffer from spectral instabilities, explore how such phenomena can further affect black-hole spectroscopy, and discuss potential ringdown imprints and waveform stability issues in current and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the free energy $\mathcal{F}$ and temperature $T$ of black holes, considered as a thermodynamic system, can be viewed as an $A$-discriminant of an appropriately-defined polynomial. As such, mathematical results about $A$-discriminants may lead to implications about black hole thermodynamics. In particular, for static spacetimes with spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry, the number of distinct thermodynamic phases depend on the number of distinct terms in the metric component $g_{tt}$. We prove that if $g_{tt}$ consists of $N_f$ distinct terms, then the $\mathcal{F}$-$T$ curve consists of $N_f-2$ cusps, which in turn leads to $N_f-1$ distinct thermodynamic phases. This result is applied to explicit examples of the Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m, power-law Maxwell, and Euler--Heisenberg black holes.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review notions of mass of asymptotically locally Anti-de Sitter three-dimensional spacetimes, and apply them to some known solutions. For two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets the mass is not invariant under asymptotic symmetries, but a unique mass parameter can be obtained either by minimisation, or by a monodromy construction, or both. We give an elementary proof of positivity, and of a Penrose-type inequality, in a natural gauge. We apply the "Maskit gluing construction" to time-symmetric asymptotically locally hyperbolic vacuum initial data sets and derive mass/entropy formulae for the resulting manifolds. Finally, we show that all mass aspect functions can be realised by constant scalar curvature metrics on complete manifolds which are smooth except for at most one conical singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of cluster algebras of infinite rank associated with root systems of type $A$, $D$, $E$. We show that suitable completions of these cluster algebras are isomorphic to the Grothendieck rings of the categories $\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{Z}$ of the corresponding shifted quantum affine algebras. The cluster variables of a class of distinguished initial seeds are certain formal power series defined by E. Frenkel and the second author, which satisfy a system of functional relations called $QQ$-system. We conjecture that all cluster monomials are classes of simple objects of $\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{Z}$. In the final section, we show that these cluster algebras contain infinitely many cluster subalgebras isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the open double Bruhat cell of the corresponding simple simply-connected algebraic group. This explains the similarity between $QQ$-system relations and certain generalized minor identities discovered by Fomin and Zelevinsky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields play an important role in constructing modified gravity theories. In the case of a single scalar field with timelike gradient, the corresponding Lagrangian in the unitary gauge takes the form of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), which is proved useful in analyzing and extending the generally covariant theories. In this work, we apply the SCG method to the scalar-nonmetricity theory, of which the Lagrangian is built of the nonmetricity tensor and a scalar field. We derive the 3+1 decomposition of the geometric quantities and especially covariant derivatives of the scalar field up to the third order in the presence of a nonvanishing nonmetricity tensor. By fixing the unitary gauge, the resulting Lagrangian takes the form of a SCG with nonmetricity, in which all the ingredients are spatial tensors. We then exhaust the scalar monomials of SCG with nonmetricity up to $d=3$ with $d$ the total number of derivatives. Since the disformation tensor plays as an auxiliary variable, we take the Lagrangian with $d=2$ as an example to show that after solving the disformation tensor, we can get an effective SCG theory for the metric variables but with modified coefficients. Our results provides a novel approach to extending the scalar-nonmetricity theory.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Tensions: Localising Missing Physics through Consistency Checks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM tensions are by definition model dependent; one sees anomalies through the prism of $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, progress towards tension resolution necessitates checking the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model to localise missing physics either in redshift or scale. Since the Universe is dynamical and redshift is a proxy for time, it is imperative to first perform consistency checks involving redshift, then consistency checks involving scale, as the next steps to settle the ``systematics versus new physics" debate and foster informed model building. We present a review of the hierarchy of assumptions underlying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and comment on whether relaxing them can address the tensions. We focus on the lowest lying fruit of identifying missing physics through the identification of redshift dependent $\Lambda$CDM model fitting parameters. We highlight recent progress made on ${S_8:= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ tension and elucidate how similar progress can be made on $H_0$ tension. Our discussions indicate that $H_0$ tension, equivalently a redshift dependent $H_0$, and a redshift dependent $S_8$ imply a problem with background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The Casimir effect is a macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the vacuum. On a ring, it leads to a finite size correction to the vacuum energy. In this work, we show that this vacuum's energy and pressure acquire additional, sizable corrections, when the ring's radius is increased fast enough, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding universe. This effect is distinct from the dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of the conformal anomaly, originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the increase of the ring's radius. This anomalous dynamical Casimir effect is measurable through the work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes non-monotonous in time.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and can act as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find an anomalous contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

      <title>On a B-field transform of generalized complex structures over complex tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X^n,\check{X}^n)$ be a mirror pair of an $n$-dimensional complex torus $X^n$ and its mirror partner $\check{X}^n$. Then, by SYZ transform, we can construct a holomorphic line bundle with an integrable connection from each pair of a Lagrangian section of $\check{X}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and a unitary local system along it, and those holomorphic line bundles with integrable connections forms a dg-category $DG_{X^n}$. In this paper, we focus on a certain B-field transform of the generalized complex structure induced from the complex structure on $X^n$, and interpret it as the deformation $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ of $X^n$ by a flat gerbe $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, we construct the deformation of $DG_{X^n}$ associated to the deformation from $X^n$ to $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$, and also discuss the homological mirror symmetry between $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ and its mirror partner on the object level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and long-lived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasi-normal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomena in gauge theory are often described in the physics literature via a specific choice of gauge. In foundational and philosophical discussions this is often criticized as introducing gauge dependence, and contrasted against (often aspirational) "gauge-invariant" descriptions of the physics. I argue, largely in the context of scalar electrodynamics, that this is misguided, and that descriptions of a physical process within a specific gauge are in fact gauge-invariant descriptions. However, most of them are non-local descriptions of that physics, and I suggest that this ought to be the real objection to such descriptions. I explore the unitary gauge as the exception to this nonlocality and consider its strengths and limitations, as well as (more briefly) its extension beyond scalar electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Partial Renormalization of Quasiparticle Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum -- we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough -- but it is a significant step in that direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in homogeneous projective coordinates, because it is then possible to write all transformations of such a group in a manifestly linear way. The 2-sphere metric, Bondi-Metzner-Sachs metric, asymptotic Killing vectors, generators of supertranslations, as well as boosts and rotations of Minkowski spacetime, are all re-expressed in homogeneous projective coordinates. Last, the integral curves of vector fields which generate supertranslations are evaluated in detail. This work prepares the ground for more advanced applications of the differential geometry of asymptotically flat spacetimes in projective coordinates.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by infinite-component Chern-Simons theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to construct 3D lattice models for demonstrating Toeplitz braiding, which is left to future investigation.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the ground state Bethe roots for the inhomogeneous XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for the Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain in the critical regime, the scaling limit of the vacuum Bethe roots yields an infinite set of numbers that coincide with the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical 3D anharmonic oscillator. The discovery of this curious relation, among others, gave rise to the approach referred to as the ODE/IQFT (or ODE/IM) correspondence. Here we consider a multiparametric generalization of the Heisenberg spin chain, which is associated with the inhomogeneous six-vertex model. When quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed the lattice system may be explored within the Bethe Ansatz technique. We argue that for the critical spin chain, with a properly formulated scaling limit, the scaled Bethe roots for the ground state are described by second order differential equations, which are multi-parametric generalizations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string changes permanently to an elliptical form after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>
