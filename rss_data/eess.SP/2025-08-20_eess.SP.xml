      <title>InverTwin: Solving Inverse Problems via Differentiable Radio Frequency Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), virtual simulated replicas of physical scenes, are transforming various industries. However, their potential in radio frequency (RF) sensing applications has been limited by the unidirectional nature of conventional RF simulators. In this paper, we present InverTwin, an optimization-driven framework that creates RF digital twins by enabling bidirectional interaction between virtual and physical realms. InverTwin overcomes the fundamental differentiability challenges of RF optimization problems through novel design components, including path-space differentiation to address discontinuity in complex simulation functions, and a radar surrogate model to mitigate local non-convexity caused by RF signal periodicity. These techniques enable smooth gradient propagation and robust optimization of the DT model. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate InverTwin's versatility and effectiveness in augmenting both data-driven and model-driven RF sensing systems for DT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Convex Regularization for Magnetic Resonance Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularization for denoising in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically achieved using convex regularization functions. Recently, deep learning techniques have been shown to provide superior denoising performance. However, this comes at the price of lack of explainability, interpretability and stability, which are all crucial to MRI. In this work, we present a constructive approach for designing weakly-convex regularization functions for MR image denoising. We show that our technique performs on par with state-of-the-art denoisers for diffusion-weighted MR image denoising. Our technique can be applied to design weakly-convex convolutional neural networks with prototype activation functions that impart interpretability and are provably convergent. We also show that our technique exhibits fewer denoising artifacts by demonstrating its effect on brain microstructure modelling.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems-Enabled Multi-User Communications: Transmission Structures and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching (WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1) the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are geographically isolated.</description>

      <title>FPGA Design and Implementation of Fixed-Point Fast Divider Using Goldschmidt Division Algorithm and Mitchell Multiplication Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a variable bit-width fixed-point fast divider using Goldschmidt division algorithm and Mitchell multiplication algorithm. Described using Verilog HDL and implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z020-2CLG400I FPGA, the proposed divider achieves over 99% computational accuracy with a minimum latency of 99.1 ns, which is 31.7 ns faster than existing single-precision dividers. Compared with a Goldschmidt divider using a Vedic multiplier, the proposed design reduces Slice Registers by 46.68%, Slice LUTs by 4.93%, and Slices by 11.85%, with less than 1% accuracy loss and only 24.1 ns additional delay. These results demonstrate an improved balance between computational speed and resource utilization, making the divider well-suited for high-performance FPGA-based systems with strict resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Design of a Gm-C Dynamic Amplifier with High Linearity and High Temperature and Power Supply Voltage Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Gm-C dynamic amplifier with high linearity and high temperature and power supply voltage stability. The main part of the amplifier employs two asymmetric differential pairs to enhance transconductance linearity. The amplifier maintains a nearly constant gain within a differential input range of -40 mV to 40 mV, and achieves a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 70.5 dB. The bias part of the amplifier adopts a constant-gm bias circuit, which improves the temperature and supply voltage stability of the amplifier's transconductance and gain. When the differential input is 1 mV, the power supply voltage fluctuates by $\pm$10%, and the temperature varies between -40$\mathrm{^\circ C}$ and 120$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the standard deviation of the gain distribution is 262m, and the distribution range is from 15.1 to 16.3.</description>

      <title>Failure Tolerant Phase-Only Indoor Positioning via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision localization turns into a crucial added value and asset for next-generation wireless systems. Carrier phase positioning (CPP) enables sub-meter to centimeter-level accuracy and is gaining interest in 5G-Advanced standardization. While CPP typically complements time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements, recent literature has introduced a phase-only positioning approach in a distributed antenna/MIMO system context with minimal bandwidth requirements, using deep learning (DL) when operating under ideal hardware assumptions. In more practical scenarios, however, antenna failures can largely degrade the performance. In this paper, we address the challenging phase-only positioning task, and propose a new DL-based localization approach harnessing the so-called hyperbola intersection principle, clearly outperforming the previous methods. Additionally, we consider and propose a processing and learning mechanism that is robust to antenna element failures. Our results show that the proposed DL model achieves robust and accurate positioning despite antenna impairments, demonstrating the viability of data-driven, impairment-tolerant phase-only positioning mechanisms. Comprehensive set of numerical results demonstrates large improvements in localization accuracy against the prior art methods.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beamforming Optimization for Near-Field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is a promising technology for future wireless networks, enabling simultaneous communication and sensing using shared resources. This paper investigates the performance of full-duplex (FD) communication in near-field ISAC systems, where spherical-wave propagation introduces unique beam-focusing capabilities. We propose a joint optimization framework for transmit and receive beamforming at the base station to minimize transmit power while satisfying rate constraints for multi-user downlink transmission, multi-user uplink reception, and multi-target sensing. Our approach employs alternating optimization combined with semidefinite relaxation and Rayleigh quotient techniques to address the non-convexity of the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-enabled near-field ISAC achieves superior power efficiency compared to half-duplex and far-field benchmarks, effectively detecting targets at identical angles while meeting communication requirements.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Routing for Heterogeneous Multi-Hop Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing in multi-hop wireless networks is a complex problem, especially in heterogeneous networks where multiple wireless communication technologies coexist. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been introduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based on local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and poor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or dynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with diverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep Q-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability and adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication technology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN, selecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only defines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN. To this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel gain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an improved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the model experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and robustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node selection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that the DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs comparably to the optimal approach.</description>

      <title>Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection for Electroencephalogram: A Task-Independent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.</description>

      <title>Load Forecasting on A Highly Sparse Electrical Load Dataset Using Gaussian Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset, often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline, moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS), if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models, we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.</description>

      <title>Towards Low-Latency Tracking of Multiple Speakers With Short-Context Speaker Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.</description>

      <title>A Data-Based Review of Battery Electric Vehicle and Traction Inverter Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have advanced significantly during the past decade, yet drivetrain energy losses continue to restrict practical range and elevate cost. A dataset comprising more than 1000 European-market BEVs (model years 2010-2025) is combined with detailed inverter-motor co-simulation to chart technology progress for and quantify the efficiency and cost-saving potential of partial-load optimised multi-level inverter (MLI) for 2030. Average drive-cycle range has climbed from 135 km to 455 km, while fleet-average energy consumption has remained virtually constant. Three inverter topologies are assessed to evaluate future efficiency and cost enhancements: a conventional two-level (2L) six halfbridge (B6) inverter with silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and two three-level (3L) T-type neutral point clamped (TNPC) and active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters tailored for partial-load operation. The 3L-TNPC inverter, realised with only 30% additional SiC chip area, lowers drive-cycle drivetrain losses by 0.67 kWh/100 km relative to a SiC 2L-B6 baseline. These results identify partial-load optimised MLIs as a cost-effective route to further reduce BEV energy consumption and total system cost.</description>

      <title>DualNILM: Energy Injection Identification Enabled Disaggregation with Deep Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture, DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods.</description>

      <title>ListenToJESD204B: A Lightweight Open-Source JESD204B IP Core for FPGA-Based Ultrasound Acquisition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for hundreds of tightly synchronized channels operating at tens of MSPS in ultrasound systems exceeds conventional low-voltage differential signaling links' bandwidth, pin count, and latency. Although the JESD204B serial interface mitigates these limitations, commercial FPGA IP cores are proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive. We present ListenToJESD204B, an open-source receiver IP core released under a permissive Solderpad 0.51 license for AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ devices. Written in synthesizable SystemVerilog, the core supports four GTH/GTY lanes at 12.8 Gb/s and provides cycle-accurate AXI-Stream data alongside deterministic Subclass~1 latency. It occupies only 107 configurable logic blocks (approximately 437 LUTs), representing a 79\% reduction compared to comparable commercially available IP. A modular data path featuring per-lane elastic buffers, SYSREF-locked LMFC generation, and optional LFSR descrambling facilitates scaling to high lane counts. We verified protocol compliance through simulation against the Xilinx JESD204C IP in JESD204B mode and on hardware using TI AFE58JD48 ADCs. Block stability was verified by streaming 80 MSPS, 16-bit samples over two 12.8 Gb/s links for 30 minutes with no errors.</description>

      <title>Domain-Factored Untrained Deep Prior for Spectrum Cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectrum cartography (SC) focuses on estimating the radio power propagation map of multiple emitters across space and frequency using limited sensor measurements. Recent advances in SC have shown that leveraging learned deep generative models (DGMs) as structural constraints yields state-of-the-art performance. By harnessing the expressive power of neural networks, these structural "priors" capture intricate patterns in radio maps. However, training DGMs requires substantial data, which is not always available, and distribution shifts between training and testing data can further degrade performance. To address these challenges, this work proposes using untrained neural networks (UNNs) for SC. UNNs, commonly applied in vision tasks to represent complex data without training, encode structural information of data in neural architectures. In our approach, a custom-designed UNN represents radio maps under a spatio-spectral domain factorization model, leveraging physical characteristics to reduce sample complexity of SC. Experiments show that the method achieves performance comparable to learned DGM-based SC, without requiring training data.</description>

      <title>Cellular, Cell-less, and Everything in Between: A Unified Framework for Utility Region Analysis in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions. Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the beamforming strategy.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Saliency Maps for Explaining Low-Quality Electrocardiograms to End Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using medical images for diagnosis, either by clinicians or artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is important that the images are of high quality. When an image is of low quality, the medical exam that produced the image often needs to be redone. In telemedicine, a common problem is that the quality issue is only flagged once the patient has left the clinic, meaning they must return in order to have the exam redone. This can be especially difficult for people living in remote regions, who make up a substantial portion of the patients at Portal Telemedicina, a digital healthcare organization based in Brazil. In this paper, we report on ongoing work regarding (i) the development of an AI system for flagging and explaining low-quality medical images in real-time, (ii) an interview study to understand the explanation needs of stakeholders using the AI system at OurCompany, and, (iii) a longitudinal user study design to examine the effect of including explanations on the workflow of the technicians in our clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first longitudinal study on evaluating the effects of XAI methods on end-users -- stakeholders that use AI systems but do not have AI-specific expertise. We welcome feedback and suggestions on our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) into cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems, focusing on applications involving simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The system supports concurrently two user groups: information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs). A BD-RIS is employed to enhance the wireless power transfer (WPT) directed towards the EUs. To comprehensively evaluate the system's performance, we present an analytical framework for the spectral efficiency (SE) of IUs and the average harvested energy (HE) of EUs in the presence of spatial correlation among the BD-RIS elements and for a non-linear energy harvesting circuit. Our findings offer important insights into the transformative potential of BD-RIS, setting the stage for the development of more efficient and effective SWIPT networks. Finally, incorporating a heuristic scattering matrix design at the BD-RIS results in a substantial improvement compared to the scenario with random scattering matrix</description>

      <title>TolerantECG: A Foundation Model for Imperfect Electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</description>
