      <title>Super-resolution microscopy via fluctuation-enhanced spatial mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a superresolution technique that combines spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with emitter blinking. We show that temporal fluctuations not only enhance the precision of SPADE imaging, but also drastically simplify the measurement required to recover full object information -- in the presence of fluctuations, SPADE can be replaced by the much simpler image inversion interferometry. Both gains are enabled by exploiting temporal cumulants of the detected signal.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Negative Refraction Enabled by Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically demonstrate nonreciprocal negative refraction enabled by time-varying photonic structures. By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart. This work introduces a general framework for nonreciprocal negative refraction across frequency regimes, expanding the design space of time-varying metasurfaces and photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Coupled Mode Model for Fiber Laser Amplifiers as an Averaged Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a known theorem for simplifying dynamical systems with bounded error to a specific optical fiber waveguide problem, supplementing the physical intuition and heuristics used in the optics community with proper mathematical justification. Using techniques from averaging theory of dynamical systems, a reliable accelerated model based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) approach for a common fiber laser amplifier application is derived. Computational testing reveals that this accelerated model achieves an ${\sim}4000$x increase in computational speed compared to the CMT model while preserving a high accuracy in key figures-of-merit such as output power and amplification efficiency. Further, we argue that by adopting our recommended approximations within the reduced model framework enables the model to be applied a wider set of amplifier types and configurations than can the current (comparable) reduced models found in the literature.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for nonlinear frequency combs under electro-optic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency combs, including electro-optic and Kerr combs, have become central platforms for chip-scale frequency synthesis. Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Reconstruction for Fractional Lateral Shear Measurements using Weighted Integer Shear Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Passage of neutrons through accelerating crystal and the acceleration effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of changing the energy of a neutron when it passes through an accelerating crystal under conditions close to the Bragg condition is considered. It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Varifocal Switching in a Polarization-Insensitive Si--GST Metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have become a cornerstone of flat-optics, enabling precise control over light propagation through nanoengineered materials. Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 {\mu}m. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 {\mu}m to 200 {\mu}m, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous generation of Raman-assisted Soliton Microcombs and Tunable Multi-chromatic Raman Microlasers in Single Monolithic Thin-film Lithium Niobate Microrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance integrated broadband coherent light sources are essential for advanced applications in high-bandwidth data processing and chip-scale metrology, yet remain challenging. In this study, we demonstrate a monolithic Z-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) microring platform that enables simultaneous generation of tunable multi-chromatic microlasers and Raman-assisted soliton microcombs. Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum. Under continuous-wave laser pumping at 3.73 mW in the telecom band, we achieved a Raman-assisted soliton comb centered at 1624.49 nm with record-low pump threshold on the LNOI platform. Concurrently, multi-chromatic Raman lasing outputs were observed at ~1700, ~813, and ~535 nm within the same microring. The system exhibited efficient wavelength tuning of these multi-chromatic laser signals through a 5 nm shift in pump wavelength. This work represents a significant advance in integrated photonics for versatile optical signal generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics-assisted millimeter-wave bands and terahertz signal generation offer significant advantages over traditional electronic methods by leveraging the inherent benefits of optical components, including broad bandwidth, low power consumption, and minimal insertion loss. This work utilizes a silicon photonic chip in conjunction with a reconfigurable optical frequency comb to demonstrate the synthesis of signals in the millimeter-wave range. The implemented photonic system performs on-chip filtering and modulation, producing high-bandwidth single frequency, multi-frequency, and vector signals suitable for arbitrary IQ signal construction. These results highlight the flexible and reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed approach, providing new perspectives for applications in radio-over-fiber systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Monitoring and Regulation of Micro-Displacement Deviation in Few-Mode Beam Alignment through Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam alignment enables efficient, stable transmission and control of optical energy and information, which critically depend on precise monitoring and regulation of the three-dimensional (3D) relative positioning between fibers. This study introduces an approach to achieve more accurate 3D measurement of the spatial displacement between two optical fibers in a few-mode configuration, by integrating mode decomposition with a straightforward machine learning algorithm. This method leverages inherent information from the optical field, enabling precise beam alignment with a simple structure and minimal computational effort. In the 3D measurement experiment, the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.99 for transverse offsets in the x- and y-directions, and 0.98 for air gap in the z-direction. The RMSE in x-direction, y-direction and z-direction is respectively 0.135 {\mu}m, 0.128 {\mu}m and 2.42 {\mu}m. The time for a single 3D displacement calculation is 4.037e-4 seconds. Furthermore, it facilitates single-step displacement regulation with a deviation tolerance within 0.15 {\mu}m and modal content regulation with an accuracy of 4.67%. These results establish a theoretical framework for addressing key challenges in optical path alignment, crosstalk compensation, precision instrument manufacturing, and fiber optic sensing.</description>

      <title>Low-dose Chemically Specific Bioimaging via Deep-UV Lensless Holographic Microscopy on a Standard Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) microscopy can provide label-free biochemical contrast by exploiting the intrinsic absorption of nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, offering chemically specific morphological information that complements structural optical thickness contrast from phase-sensitive imaging. However, existing DUV microscopes typically rely on specialized optics and DUV-sensitive cameras, which restrict field of view, increase system complexity and cost, and often require high illumination doses that risk photodamage. Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at {\lambda} = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells. This combination of low-dose operation, chemically specific contrast and standard CMOS hardware establishes DUV lensless holographic microscopy as a practical and scalable route to high-content submicron-resolution whole-slide preparation-free bioimaging without exogenous labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical white-light interferometric method, supported by an open-source Python library \textit{optifik} for automated spectrum-to-thickness deduction, enabling foam film measurements down to a few nanometers. We describe three typical spectral scenarii encountered in this method: spectra exhibiting numerous interference fringes, spectra with a moderate number of peaks, and spectra with only a few identifiable features, providing illustrative examples for each case. We also discuss the main limitations of the technique, including spectral range constraints, the necessity of knowing the refractive index, and the influence of spectral resolution and signal quality. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method in a time-resolved study of a TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) foam film undergoing elongation and thinning. This method can be adapted to measure any thin non-opaque layer.</description>

      <title>Integrated emitters with CMOS-compatible tuning for large scale quantum SiN photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation scalable quantum photonic technologies operating at the single photon level rely on bringing together optimized quantum building blocks with minimal optical coupling losses. Achieving this necessitates the heterogeneous integration of different elements onto a single interposer chip. Integrated quantum emitters are key enablers for generating single photons, inducing quantum nonlinearities, and producing entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate the scalable integration of mature InGaAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides onto a low-loss SiN photonic platform, as evidenced by a high processing yield of 94.7% using a commercially available micro-transfer printing tool. These integrated emitters are embedded within a p-i-n heterostructure that allows for noise suppression, near-blinking-free operation and wavelength tunability upon CMOS-level electrical biasing. With this, we pave the way for scalable integration of diverse quantum photonic devices on a single chip.</description>

      <title>High resolution 3D imaging of diamonds with multiphoton microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamonds offer unique benefits for optical technology development due to their optical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. These attributes also contribute to their aesthetic appeal, high commercial value, and utility in geological studies. Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.</description>

      <title>Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.</description>

      <title>Different Rise Times of Atomic Br M$_{4,5}$ 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ Core Level Absorptions during Br$_{2}$ C $^{1}\Pi_{u}$ $1_{u}$ State Dissociation via Extreme Ultraviolet Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reported ''dissociation times'' for the Br$_{2}$ C ($^{1}\Pi_{u}$ $1_{u}$) state by various measurement methods differ widely across the literature (30 to 340 fs). We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\pm$ 1 and 20 $\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.</description>

      <title>Phonon-tunable THz magnonic emission in multiferroic heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.</description>

      <title>Tunable WS$_2$ Micro-Dome Open Cavity Single Photon Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip electro-optically tunable narrow linewidth Brillouin microlasers implemented in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip narrow linewidth microlasers with real-time wavelength tunability are highly desirable for various applications including precision metrology, quantum technology, and coherent information processing. Realizing such laser remains a challenge despite significant advances made by various groups in recent years [Nat. Commun. 13, 5344 (2022); Nature 615, 411 (2023); Appl. Phys. Lett. 124, 131101 (2024); Nat. Photonics 13, 60 (2019)]. In this work, we overcome these hurdles and demonstrate on-chip electro-optically tunable Brillouin microlasers in compact lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) microdisks with diameters of 31.5 um and 117.0 um by using cross-polarized SBS arrangement. A quasi-continuum band of bound shear mechanical modes inside the suspended microdisk are revealed for the first time, allowing feasible phase matching of stimulated Brillouin lasing (SBL). We achieve efficient cross-polarized optomechanical coupling and SBL via the significant photoelastic tensors of lithium niobate (e.g., p41=-1.51). This approach yields a 118 Hz intrinsic linewidth and a comparatively low threshold power of 3.15 mW. A real-time electro-optic tuning of the cross-polarized Brillouin scheme with a tuning efficiency of ~93.1 kHz/V is also achieved, further showcasing potential of LNOI platform for next-generation tunable photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Exceptional Points Induced by Non-Markovian Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are central to non-Hermitian physics because of their unique properties and broad application prospects. While extensively studied in parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$)-symmetric systems and under Markovian dynamics, their exploration in broader pseudo-Hermitian settings particularly those involving non-Markovian environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate a pseudo-Hermitian system consisting of three coupled optical cavities interacting with non-Markovian environments. Compared to the Markovian baseline, we demonstrate that the emergence of non-Markovian memory effects enlarges the dimensionality of the parameter space of the system, thereby giving rise to higher-order EPs. Moreover, we observe that the pseudo-Hermitian system with an effective gain induced by coherent perfect absorption enables the higher-order EPs to be directly read out from the output spectrum. Additionally, we find that breaking the symmetry of the parameter space of the system reduces the order of the EPs. Possible experimental implementations based on a superconducting circuit are also discussed. Our findings reveal how non-Markovianity enhances the sensitivity of the system and provide a theoretical insight into the experimental observation of higher-order EPs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Cascading Flat Bands in Breathing Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Neural Network for Metasurface Optical Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physics-constrained neural network is presented for predicting the optical response of metasurfaces. Our approach incorporates physical laws directly into the neural network architecture and loss function, addressing critical challenges in the modeling of metasurfaces. Unlike methods that require specialized weighting strategies or separate architectural branches to handle different data regimes and phase wrapping discontinuities, this unified approach effectively addresses phase discontinuities, energy conservation constraints, and complex gap-dependent behavior. We implement sine-cosine phase representation with Euclidean normalization as a non-trainable layer within the network, enabling the model to account for the periodic nature of phase while enforcing the mathematical constraint $\sin^2 \phi + \cos^2 \phi = 1$. A Euclidean distance-based loss function in the sine-cosine space ensures a physically meaningful error metric while preventing discontinuity issues. The model achieves good, consistent performance (e.g., coefficient of determinations above 0.9) with small, imbalanced datasets of 580 and 1075 data points, compared to several thousand typically required by alternative approaches. This physics-informed approach preserves physical interpretability while reducing reliance on large datasets and could be extended to systems involving periodic or wrapped quantities.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Bound States in the Continuum in Bilayer Structures against Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a bilayer dielectric rod array against geometric and material perturbations. Our analysis focuses on both symmetry-protected and Fabry-P\'erot BICs, examining their transformation into quasi-BICs under three structural modifications: (i) in-plane displacement of one layer, which breaks the C$_2$ symmetry of the system; (ii) introduction of material losses that break time-reversal symmetry; and (iii) variation in the interlayer distance, which preserves structural symmetry. In particular, we demonstrate that material losses inevitably induce radiation in Fabry-P\'erot BICs via second-order perturbation processes, converting them into quasi-BICs, while symmetry-protected BICs remain non-radiative. We further show that, despite the inherent instability of BICs under symmetry-breaking effects, their resilience can be significantly enhanced through proper design. Both Fabry-P\'erot and symmetry-protected BICs exhibit exponentially weak sensitivity to C$_2$-breaking perturbations as the interlayer distance increases. Finally, we show that additional FP-BICs emerge under oblique incidence, originating from the interference of two high-Q quasi-BICs near the symmetry-protected ones. Our findings pave the way for the development of BIC-based photonic devices with improved robustness against fabrication imperfections, environmental variations, and material losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully harnessing the vast design space enabled by metamaterials to control electromagnetic (EM) fields remains an open problem for researchers. Inverse-design techniques have shown to best exploit the degrees of freedom available in design, resulting in high-performing systems for wireless communications, sensing and analog signal processing. Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) software based on transformer model is developed to automatically design gratings for possible integrations in ion traps to perform optical addressing on ions. From the user-defined (x,z) coordinates and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) values, the AI software can automatically generate the Graphic Design System (GDS) layout of the grating that shoots light towards the pre-defined (x,z) coordinates with built-in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation for performance verification. Based on the FDTD verification, AI-design gratings produced grating-to-free-space light that shoots towards the provided (x,z) target with &lt; 2 micron deviations. For most attempts, the FWHM of FDTD simulation has &lt; 2 micron deviations from the user-defined FWHM. The AI-designed gratings were successfully taped out and capable of producing output light for possible optical addressing of trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Complete inelastic transparency of time-modulated resonant photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic circuits modulated in time can convert the input light frequency $\omega_0$ shifting it by multiples of the modulation frequency $\omega_p$ and, in certain cases, amplify the total input light power. Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $\omega_p \ll \omega_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $\omega_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency. Light enters these circuits with a resonant frequency $\omega_0$, cascades between their $N$ eigenstates separated by the modulation frequency $\omega_p$, and exits with frequency $\omega_0 + (N-1)\omega_p$ and the output amplitude close to the input amplitude. As examples, we consider circuits of ring microresonators and SNAP microresonators.</description>

      <title>Spectral Riemann Surface Topology of Gapped Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show topological configurations of the complex-valued spectra in gapped non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive EPs in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that is protected by an energy gap in the spectrum. Their presence or absence establishes topologically distinct configurations for fully non-degenerate systems and tuning between them requires a closing of the gap, forming exceptional point degeneracies. We provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Nonlinear Control of Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Strongly Interacting Rydberg Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Brillouin Random number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>
