      <title>Study of proton-proton Scattering using Phase Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The study of np and pp scattering, central to understanding nuclear force, remains an optional topic in many undergraduate nuclear physics curriculum. Purpose: The main thrust of this paper is to study pp scattering using the phase function method to obtain the observed S-wave phase shifts and cross-sections at various energies. Methods: The pp interaction has been modeled by choosing the Malfliet-Tjon potential for the nuclear part along with the screened Coulomb potential. The phase equation has been solved to obtain scattering phase shifts using the fourth-order RK method (RK-4). Results: The interaction potential obtained from optimized parameters matches well with the realistic Argonne V18 potential for 1S0 state of pp scattering and the scattering phase shifts as well as the cross-section for energies ranging from 1-350 MeV are in good agreement with expected data. Conclusion: Introducing the phase function method for S-wave (l=0) could bring this interesting study of nucleon-nucleon scattering to the undergraduate classroom.</description>

      <title>Nuclear mass predictions with anisotropic kernel ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic kernel ridge regression (AKRR) approach in nuclear mass predictions is developed by introducing the anisotropic kernel function into the kernel ridge regression (KRR) approach, without introducing new weight parameter or input in the training. A combination of double two-dimensional Gaussian kernel function is adopted, and the corresponding hyperparameters are optimized carefully by cross-validations. The anisotropic kernel shows cross-shape pattern, which highlights the correlations among the isotopes with the same proton number, and that among the isotones with the same neutron number. Significant improvements are achieved by the AKRR approach in both the interpolation and the extrapolation predictions of nuclear masses comparing with the original KRR approach.</description>

      <title>Particle production from gluon-nucleon interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a particle production mechanism analogous to the particle photoproduction processes, arising from the gluon-nucleon interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The comparison is made on the effect of the gluon-nucleon interactions on the photon production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV. The numerical results indicate that as the collision energy increases, the contribution of gluon-nucleon interactions becomes more prominent.</description>

      <title>On the damping of spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions subject to a quartic self-interaction. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <title>Does the Electron EDM Preclude Electroweak Baryogenesis ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. We show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints than implied by previous approximation formulations. Consequently, EWBG remains viable even in light of present EDM bounds. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Mass from Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

      <title>A first-order deconfinement phase transition in the early universe and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the conditions of the cosmic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) first-order phase transition in the early universe by carefully distinguishing the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions. While the chiral one with light quarks at zero chemical potential is unlikely to be first order based on the recent lattice QCD calculations, the latter one can be naturally extended with one extra rolling scalar to be first order. The argument is also valid for the dark QCD theory with arbitrary $N_c$ with a wide range of phase transition temperatures, which can be from hundreds of MeV up to beyond TeV. Notably, here we derive the general formula for the deconfinement phase transition potential of SU($N_c$) gauge theory characterized by the Polyakov loop. With the effective potential in hand, the gravitational wave spectrum is then determined via the sound shell model, which then enables us to give for the first time the quantitative analysis of the gravitational wave signals coming from the QCD deconfinement phase transition and awaits the check from future space interferometers.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of Hybrid Stars and Neutron Stars including Delta baryons: The Effect of a Slow Quark Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars composed of hadronic external layers followed by a quark matter core. We employ a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model including hyperons and ${\Delta}$ baryons to describe hadronic matter, and a density-dependent quark model for quark matter. We obtain the ten lowest eigenfrequencies and the corresponding oscillation functions of N, N+${\Delta}$, N+H, and N+H+${\Delta}$ equations-of-state with a phase transition to the quark matter at 1.4 and 1.8 ${M_{\odot}}$, focusing on the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface. We observe that the maximum mass is reached before the fundamental mode's frequency vanishes for slow phase transitions, suggesting that some stellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass remain stable even when they undergo small radial perturbations. Future gravitational wave detectors and multi-messenger astronomy, complemented by robust microscopic models enabling exploration of various neutron star compositions, including hyperon content, are anticipated to impose precise limitations on the equation of state of baryonic matter under high-density conditions.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of hexadecapole collectivity in even-even rare-earth nuclei near $N=90$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of hexadecapole correlations in the rare-earth region near $N=90$ and the effects these correlations have on various nuclear properties, such as the low-energy spectra, as well as quadrupole, hexadecapole, and monopole transition strengths. In order to examine hexadecapole correlations, we employ a mapped $sdg$ interacting boson model, with parameters derived from a self-consistent mean-field calculations with a relativistic energy density functional. We apply this model to even-even isotopes of Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er ($Z=60 - 68$) with neutron numbers $N=84-96$. The obtained results show a good agreement with the experiment. By comparing the results with the ones obtained from a simpler mapped $sd$ interacting boson model, we show that the inclusion of the hexadecapole degree of freedom via $g$ boson is necessary to improve the results of the $J^{\pi} \geq 6^{+}$ yrast energies in the nuclei with $N=84$ and 86, being near the neutron shell closure. The $sdg$ interacting boson model increases the quadrupole transition strengths between yrast states in the $N=90$ and 92 well deformed nuclei, which is in good agreement with the experiment for most of those isotopes. The presence of $g$ bosons does have an important effect on hexadecapole transition strengths, although experimental data for such transitions are limited. The obtained monopole transition strengths do not differ significantly from the ones obtained from the simpler $sd$ model.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors for Nucleons in Short-Range Correlations and the EMC effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between medium modifications of nucleon electromagnetic form factors and nucleon structure functions is examined using a model motivated by Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD). These modifications are closely connected with the influence of short-ranged correlations. The size of the modifications to nucleon form factors is shown to be about the same as the modifications to the structure functions. Thus, small limits on form factors modifications do not rule out an explanation of the EMC effect motivated by the influence of short range correlations, as claimed by a recent paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the set of inequalities that is necessary and sufficient for nonlinear causality and linear stability of first-order relativistic hydrodynamics with either a $U(1)_V$ conserved current or a $U(1)_A$ current with a chiral anomaly or both. Our results apply to generic hydrodynamic frames in which no relations among the transport parameters are imposed. Furthermore, our analysis yields, to the best of our knowledge, the first theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics proven to be causal and stable. We find that causality demands the absence of vorticity-induced heat flux, forcing a departure from the thermodynamic frame in the chiral case. The inequalities for causality and stability define a hypervolume in the space of transport parameters, wherein each point corresponds to a consistent formulation. Notably, causality is determined by just three combinations of transport parameters. We present our results in a form amenable to numerical hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the speed of sound and polytropic index of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter in the full phase diagram based on a 3-flavor Polyakov-looped Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (pNJL) model. The speed of sound and polytropic index in isothermal and adiabatic cases all have a dip structure at the low chemical potential side of the chiral phase transition boundary, and these quantities reach their global minimum values at the critical endpoint (CEP) but are not completely zero, where the values in adiabatic are lightly greater than those in isothermal. Different from the speed of sound, the polytropic index also exists a peak around the chiral phase transition boundary. Along the hypothetical chemical freeze-out lines, the speed of sound rapidly decreases near the CEP, followed by a small spinodal behavior, while the polytropic index, especially in isothermal, exhibits a more pronounced and nearly closed to zero dip structure as it approaches the CEP.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Entropy as a probe of Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of timelike entanglement entropy has sparked a lot of interest. Unlike the traditional spacelike entanglement entropy, timelike entanglement entropy involves tracing over a timelike subsystem. In this work, we propose an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space ("temporal entanglement entropy"), and relate it to the renormalization group (RG) flow. Specifically, we show that tracing over a period of Euclidean time corresponds to coarse-graining the system and can be connected to momentum space entanglement. We employ Holography, a framework naturally embedding RG flow, to illustrate our proposal. Within cutoff holography, we establish a direct link between the UV cutoff and the smallest resolvable time interval within the effective theory through the irrelevant $T\bar T$ deformation. Increasing the UV cutoff results in an enhanced capability to resolve finer time intervals, while reducing it has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that tracing over a larger Euclidean time interval is formally equivalent to integrating out more UV degrees of freedom (or lowering the temperature). As an application, we point out that the temporal entanglement entropy can detect the critical Lifshitz exponent $z$ in non-relativistic theories which is not accessible from spatial entanglement at zero temperature and density.</description>
