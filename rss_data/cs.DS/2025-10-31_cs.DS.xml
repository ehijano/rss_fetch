      <title>Online 3-Taxi on General Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online $k$-taxi problem, introduced in 1990 by Fiat, Rabani and Ravid, is a generalization of the $k$-server problem where $k$ taxis must serve a sequence of requests in a metric space. Each request is a pair of two points, representing the pick-up and drop-off location of a passenger. In the interesting ''hard'' version of the problem, the cost is the total distance that the taxis travel without a passenger. The problem is known to be substantially harder than the $k$-server problem, and prior to this work even for $k=3$ taxis it has been unknown whether a finite competitive ratio is achievable on general metric spaces. We present an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for the $3$-taxi problem.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient k-Mismatch Text Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central task in string processing is text indexing, where the goal is to preprocess a text (a string of length $n$) into an efficient index (a data structure) supporting queries about the text. Cole, Gottlieb, and Lewenstein (STOC 2004) proposed $k$-errata trees, a family of text indexes supporting approximate pattern matching queries of several types. In particular, $k$-errata trees yield an elegant solution to $k$-mismatch queries, where we are to report all substrings of the text with Hamming distance at most $k$ to the query pattern. The resulting $k$-mismatch index uses $O(n\log^k n)$ space and answers a query for a length-$m$ pattern in $O(\log^k n \log \log n + m + occ)$ time, where $occ$ is the number of approximate occurrences.
  In retrospect, $k$-errata trees appear very well optimized: even though a large body of work has adapted $k$-errata trees to various settings throughout the past two decades, the original time-space trade-off for $k$-mismatch indexing has not been improved in the general case. We present the first such improvement, a $k$-mismatch index with $O(n\log^{k-1} n)$ space and the same query time as $k$-errata trees.
  Previously, due to a result of Chan, Lam, Sung, Tam, and Wong (Algorithmica 2010), such an $O(n\log^{k-1} n)$-size index has been known only for texts over alphabets of constant size. In this setting, however, we obtain an even smaller $k$-mismatch index of size only $O(n \log^{k-2+\varepsilon+\frac{2}{k+2-(k \bmod 2)}} n)\subseteq O(n\log^{k-1.5+\varepsilon} n)$ for $2\le k\le O(1)$ and any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Along the way, we also develop improved indexes for short patterns, offering better trade-offs in this practically relevant special case.</description>

      <title>Most Juntas Saturate the Hardcore Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a function that is mildly hard for size-$s$ circuits. For sufficiently large $s$, Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma guarantees a constant-density subset of inputs on which the same function is extremely hard for circuits of size $s'&lt;\!\!&lt;s$. Blanc, Hayderi, Koch, and Tan [FOCS 2024] recently showed that the degradation from $s$ to $s'$ in this lemma is quantitatively tight in certain parameter regimes. We give a simpler and more general proof of this result in almost all parameter regimes of interest by showing that a random junta witnesses the tightness of the hardcore lemma with high probability.</description>

      <title>The Strong Birthday Problem Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Strong Birthday Problem (SBP) introduced in [1]. The problem is stated as follows: what is the minimum number of people we have to choose so that everyone has a shared birthday with probability at least 1/2? We derive recurrence relations to compute the probability, and further show a nice connection to the associated Stirling numbers of the second kind to derive additional recurrences. We implement the recurrences using dynamic programming as well as compute the values using the combinatorial formula, and provide numerical results.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior $p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.</description>

      <title>Tensor decomposition beyond uniqueness, with an application to the minrank problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank).
  As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in certain generic vector spaces of matrices.</description>

      <title>Tight Differentially Private PCA via Matrix Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular, we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Purely Private Covariance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of \cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n&lt; d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$, improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private} and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of \cite{dong2022differentially}.</description>

      <title>Reviving Thorup's Shortcut Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to revive Thorup's conjecture [Thorup, WG'92] on the existence of reachability shortcuts with ideal size-diameter tradeoffs. Thorup originally asked whether, given any graph $G=(V,E)$ with $m$ edges, we can add $m^{1+o(1)}$ ``shortcut'' edges $E_+$ from the transitive closure $E^*$ of $G$ so that $\text{dist}_{G_+}(u,v) \leq m^{o(1)}$ for all $(u,v)\in E^*$, where $G_+=(V,E\cup E_+)$. The conjecture was refuted by Hesse [Hesse, SODA'03], followed by significant efforts in the last few years to optimize the lower bounds.
  In this paper we observe that although Hesse refuted the letter of Thorup's conjecture, his work~[Hesse, SODA'03] -- and all followup work -- does not refute the spirit of the conjecture, which should allow $G_+$ to contain both new (shortcut) edges and new Steiner vertices. Our results are as follows.
  (1) On the positive side, we present explicit attacks that break all known shortcut lower bounds when Steiner vertices are allowed.
  (2) On the negative side, we rule out ideal $m^{1+o(1)}$-size, $m^{o(1)}$-diameter shortcuts whose ``thickness'' is $t=o(\log n/\log \log n)$, meaning no path can contain $t$ consecutive Steiner vertices.
  (3) We propose a candidate hard instance as the next step toward resolving the revised version of Thorup's conjecture.
  Finally, we show promising implications. Almost-optimal parallel algorithms for computing a generalization of the shortcut that approximately preserves distances or flows imply almost-optimal parallel algorithms with $m^{o(1)}$ depth for exact shortcut paths and exact maximum flow. The state-of-the-art algorithms have much worse depth of $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ [Rozho\v{n}, Haeupler, Martinsson, STOC'23] and $m^{1+o(1)}$ [Chen, Kyng, Liu, FOCS'22], respectively.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Fast and Correct Computation of Reeb Spaces for PL Bivariate Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reeb space is a fundamental data structure in computational topology that represents the fiber topology of a multi-field (or multiple scalar fields), extending the level set topology of a scalar field. Efficient algorithms have been designed for computing Reeb graphs, however, computing correct Reeb spaces for PL bivariate fields, is a challenging open problem. There are only a few implementable algorithms in the literature for computing Reeb space or its approximation via range quantization or by computing a Jacobi fiber surface which are computationally expensive or have correctness issues, i.e., the computed Reeb space may not be topologically equivalent or homeomorphic to the actual Reeb space. In the current paper, we propose a novel algorithm for fast and correct computation of the Reeb space corresponding to a generic PL bivariate field defined on a triangulation $\mathbb{M}$ of a $3$-manifold without boundary, leveraging the fast algorithms for computing Reeb graphs in the literature.
  Our algorithm is based on the computation of a Multi-Dimensional Reeb Graph (MDRG) which is first proved to be homeomorphic with the Reeb space. For the correct computation of the MDRG, we compute the Jacobi set of the PL bivariate field and its projection into the Reeb space, called the Jacobi structure. Finally, the correct Reeb space is obtained by computing a net-like structure embedded in the Reeb space and then computing its $2$-sheets in the net-like structure. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n(c_{int})\log (n) + nc_L^2)$, where $n$ is the total number of simplices in $\mathbb{M}$, $c_{int}$ is the number of intersections of the projections of the non-adjacent Jacobi set edges on the range of the bivariate field and $c_L$ is the upper bound on the number of simplices in the link of an edge of $\mathbb{M}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give a simple online algorithm to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal and Energy-Efficient Deterministic Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fault-tolerant consensus in a variant of the synchronous message passing model, where, in each round, every node can choose to be awake or asleep. This is known as the sleeping model (Chatterjee, Gmyr, Pandurangan PODC 2020) and defines the awake complexity (also called \emph{energy complexity}), which measures the maximum number of rounds that any node is awake throughout the execution. Only awake nodes can send and receive messages in a given round and all messages sent to sleeping nodes are lost. We present new deterministic consensus algorithms that tolerate up to $f&lt;n$ crash failures, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Our algorithms match the optimal time complexity lower bound of $f+1$ rounds. For multi-value consensus, where the input values are chosen from some possibly large set, we achieve an energy complexity of ${O}(\lceil f^2 / n \rceil)$ rounds, whereas for binary consensus, we show that ${O}(\lceil f / \sqrt{n} \rceil)$ rounds are possible.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion: When Is the Diameter Bound Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study when the diameter bound s is essential for the tractability of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem. Given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, the goal is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This problem generalizes Cluster Edge Deletion (s = 1) and captures distance-bounded clustering tasks.
  Montecchiani et al. (Information and Computation, 2023) proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by s + tw(G) and asked whether dependence on s is necessary. We answer negatively by showing W[1]-hardness when parameterized by pathwidth (and hence by treewidth), proving that s cannot in general be dropped. On the positive side, we show FPT algorithms parameterized by treedepth, neighborhood diversity, or cluster vertex deletion number, extending results of Italiano et al. (Algorithmica, 2023) and Komusiewicz and Uhlmann (SOFSEM, 2011). We also show that no polynomial kernel exists when parameterized by vertex cover number, even for s = 2.
  Classically, the problem is NP-hard on split graphs for s = 2, complementing the polynomial case s = 1. We give an FPT bicriteria approximation scheme running in f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} that outputs a set of at most k deletions whose components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon)s. Finally, we introduce a directed generalization, s-Club Cluster Arc Deletion, extending the undirected case to reachability distances, and show it is W[1]-hard in parameter k even on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).</description>

Abstract: In 2021, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry presented an efficient quantum algorithm for the average-case $\ell_\infty$-Short Integer Solution ($\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$) problem, in a parameter range outside the normal range of cryptographic interest, but still with no known efficient classical algorithm. This was particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without structure, and their algorithmic techniques were different from those used in prior exponential quantum speedups.
  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ and (more general) Constrained Integer Solution problems studied in their paper, showing there is no exponential quantum speedup anymore.</description>
