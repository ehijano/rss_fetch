      <title>An isoperimetric inequality for the first Robin-Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on doubly connected domains when Robin and Dirichlet conditions are imposed on the outer and the inner part of the boundary, respectively. We provide that the spherical shell reaches the maximum of the first eigenvalue of this problem among the domains with fixed measure, outer perimeter and inner $(n-1)^{th}$ quermassintegral.</description>

      <title>Towards a long-range theory of capillarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the classical theory of capillarity, describing the shape of a liquid droplet in a container, and present a recent approach which aims at accounting for long-range particle interactions.
  This nonlocal setting recovers the classical notion of surface tension in the limit. We provide some regularity results and the determination of the contact angle, supplied with various asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity in nonlinear one-phase Stefan problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the free boundary in one-phase Stefan problem with nonlinear operator. Using the Hodograph transform and a linearization technique, we prove that flat free boundaries are $C^{1, \alpha}$ in space and time. When the operator is concave (or convex) and smooth, the free boundary is smooth.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the nonlinear Hartree equation for infinitely many particles with singular interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hartree equation (NLH) in the Heisenberg picture admits steady states of the form $\gamma_f=f(-\Delta)$ representing quantum states of infinitely many particles. In this article, we consider the time evolution of perturbations from a large class of such steady states via the three-dimensional NLH. We prove that if the interaction potential $w$ has finite measure and initial states have finite relative entropy, then solutions preserve the relative free energy, and they exist globally in time. This result extends the important work of Lewin and Sabin [arXiv:1310.0603] to singular interaction cases.</description>

      <title>Differential Harnack inequalities for Fisher-KPP type equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain almost optimal differential Harnack inequalities for a class of nonlinear parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds with Bakry-\'{E}mery Ricci curvature bounded below, which includes the classical Fisher-KPP equation and Newell-Whitehead equation. Compared to existing research, we do not impose any additional conditions on the positive solutions. As its application, we derive some optimal Liouville properties.</description>

      <title>On the effect of a large cloud of rigid particles on the motion of an incompressible non--Newtonian fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the collective effect of $N$ rigid bodies $(\mathcal{S}_{n,N})_{n=1}^N$ of diameters $(r_{n,N})_{n=1}^N$ immersed in an incompressible non--Newtonian fluid is negligible in the asymptotic limit $N \to \infty$ as long as their total packing volume $\sum_{n=1}^N r_{n,N}^d$, $d=2,3$ tends to zero exponentially -- $\sum_{n=1}^N r_{n,N}^d \approx A^{-N}$ -- for a certain constant $A &gt; 1$. The result is rather surprising and in a sharp contrast with the associated homogenization problem, where the same number of obstacles can completely stop the fluid motion in the case of shear thickening viscosity. A large class of non--Newtonian fluids is included, for which the viscous stress is a subdifferential of a convex potential.</description>

      <title>Future stability of perfect fluids with extreme tilt and linear equation of state $p=c_s^2\rho$ for the Einstein-Euler system with positive cosmological constant: The range $\frac{1}{3}&lt;c_s^2&lt;\frac{3}{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the future stability of cosmological fluids, in spacetimes with an accelerated expansion, which exhibit extreme tilt behavior, ie. their fluid velocity becoming asymptotically null at timelike infinity. It has been predicted in the article \cite{LEUW} that the latter behavior is dominant for sound speeds beyond radiation $c_s=1/\sqrt{3}$, hence, bifurcating off of the stable orthogonal fluid behavior modeled by the classical FLRW family of solutions, for $c_s^2\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$. First, we construct homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-Euler system with the latter behavior, in $\mathbb{S}^3$ spatial topology, for sound speeds $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$. Then, we study their future dynamics and prove a global stability result in the restricted range $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{3}{7})$. In particular, we show that extreme tilt behavior persists to sufficiently small perturbations of the homogeneous backgrounds, without any symmetry assumptions or analyticity. Our method is based on a bootstrap argument, in weighted Sobolev spaces, capturing the exponential decay of suitable renormalized variables. Extreme tilt behavior is associated with a degeneracy in the top order energy estimates that we derive, which allows us to complete our bootstrap argument only in the aforementioned restricted range of sound speeds. Interestingly, this is a degeneracy that does not appear in the study of formal series expansions. Moreover, for the Euler equations on a fixed FLRW background, our estimates can be improved to treat the entire beyond radiation interval $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$, a result already obtained in \cite{MO}. The latter indicates that the former issue is related to the general inhomogeneous geometry of the perturbed metric in the coupled to Einstein case.</description>

      <title>On the Capacities Associated with Local Muckenhoupt Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of capacities associated with local Muckenhoupt weights. Fundamental properties of local Muckenhoupt weights will be revisited. Weak type boundedness of nonlinear potential and capacitary strong type inequalities associated with such weights will be addressed. The boundedness of the local maximal function on the spaces of Choquet integrals associated with such weighted capacities will be justified as an application of the theory. We also address on the thinness of sets with the Kellogg property as another application.</description>

      <title>Strong stabilization of damped nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with saturation on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the damped nonlinear Schr\''{o}dinger equation with saturation: i.e., the complex evolution equation contains in its left hand side, besides the potential term $V(x)u,$ a nonlinear term of the form $\mathrm{i}\mu u(t,x)/|u(t,x)|$ for a given parameter $\mu &gt;0$ (arising in optical applications on non-Kerr-like fibers). In the right hand side we assume a given forcing term $f(t,x).$ The important new difficulty, in contrast to previous results in the literature, comes from the fact that the spatial domain is assumed to be unbounded. We start by proving the existence and uniqueness of weak and strong solutions according the regularity of the data of the problem. The existence of solutions with a lower regularity is also obtained by working with a sequence of spaces verifying the Radon-Nikod\'{y}m property. Concerning the asymptotic behavior for large times we prove a strong stabilization result. For instance, in the one dimensional case we prove that there is extinction in finite time of the solutions under the mere assumption that the $L^\infty$-norm of the forcing term $f(t,x)$ becomes less than $\mu$ after a finite time. This presents some analogies with the so called feedback \textit{bang-bang controls} $v$ (here $v=-\mathrm{i}\mu u/|u|+f).$</description>

      <title>On the Cauchy problem for logarithmic fractional Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fractional Schrodinger equation with a logarithmic  nonlinearity, when the power of the Laplacian is between zero and  one. We prove global existence results in three different functional  spaces: the Sobolev space corresponding to the quadratic form domain  of the fractional Laplacian, the energy space, and a space contained  in the operator domain of the fractional Laplacian. For this last  case, a finite momentum assumption is made, and the key step  consists in estimating the Lie commutator between the fractional  Laplacian and the multiplication by a monomial.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness to inverse acoustic and elastic medium scattering problems with hyper-singular source method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with inverse scattering problems of determining the support of an isotropic and homogeneous penetrable body from knowledge of multi-static far-field patterns in acoustics and in linear elasticity. The normal derivative of the total fields admits no jump on the interface of the scatterer in the trace sense. If the contrast function of the refractive index function or the density function has a positive lower bound near the boundary, we propose a hyper-singular source method to prove uniqueness of inverse scattering with all incoming plane waves at a fixed energy. It is based on subtle analysis on the leading part of the scattered field when hyper-singular sources caused by the first derivative of the fundamental solution approach to a boundary point. As a by-product, we show that this hyper-singular method can be also used to determine the boundary value of a Holder continuous refractive index function in acoustics or a Holder continuous density function in linear elasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem to the linear damped $\sigma$-evolution equation with time-dependent damping in the effective cases \begin{equation*} u_{t t}+(-\Delta)^\sigma u+b(t)(-\Delta)^\delta u_t=0, \end{equation*} and investigate the decay rates of the solution and its derivatives that are expressed in terms of the decay character of the initial data $u_0(x)=u(0, x)$ and $u_1(x)=u_t(0, x)$. We are interested also in the existence and decay rate of the global in time solution with small data for the corresponding semi-linear problem with the nonlinear term of power type $||D|^\gamma u|^p$. The blow-up results for solutions to the semi-linear problem in the case $\gamma=0$ are presented to show the sharpness of the exponent $p$.</description>

      <title>A negative result on regularity estimates on finite radial Morse index solutions to elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the regularity theory of solutions to elliptic partial differential equations often the concept of stability plays the role of a sufficient condition for smoothness. It is a natural question to ask if this holds true for nonstable but finite Morse index solutions. We provide a negative answer showing the existence of sequences of solutions with radial Morse index equal to 1 for which regularity estimates can not be satisfied.</description>

      <title>A priori regularity estimates for equations degenerating on nodal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $\textit{a priori}$ and $\textit{a posteriori}$ H\"older bounds and Schauder $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for continuous solutions to singular/degenerate equations with variable coefficients of type $$ \mathrm{div}\left(|u|^a A\nabla w\right)=0\qquad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n, $$ where the weight $u$ solves an elliptic equation of type $\mathrm{div}\left(A\nabla u\right)=0$ with a Lipschitz-continuous and uniformly elliptic matrix $A$ and has a nontrivial, possibly singular, nodal set. Such estimates are uniform with respect to $u$ in a class of normalized solutions having bounded Almgren's frequency. More precisely, we provide $\textit{a priori}$ H\"{o}lder bounds in any space dimension, and Schauder estimates when $n=2$. When $a=2$, the results apply to the ratios of two solutions to the same PDE sharing their zero sets. Then, one can infer higher order boundary Harnack principles on nodal domains by applying the Schauder estimates for solutions to the auxiliary degenerate equation. The results are based upon a fine blow-up argument, Liouville theorems and quasiconformal maps.</description>

      <title>Four-fifths laws in incompressible and magnetized fluids: Helicity, Energy and Cross-helicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the Kolmogorov's scaling laws of conserved quantities. By means of Eyink's longitudinal structure functions and the analysis of interaction of different physical quantities, we extend celebrated four-fifths laws from energy to helicity in incompressible fluid and, energy and cross-helicity in magnetohydrodynamic flow. In contrast to pervious 4/5 laws of energy and cross-helicity in magnetized fluids obtained by Politano and Pouquet, they are in terms of the mixed three-order structure functions rather than the structure coupling correlation functions.</description>

      <title>POD Suboptimal Control of Evolution Problems: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work is organized as follows. First an introduction is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we introduce the POD method in finite and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and discuss various applications. Chapter 3 is devoted to to POD-based Galerkin schemes for evolution problems. Mainly, we study linear problems taking different discretization methods into account. We provide a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Furthermore, the numerical realizations are explained and illustrated by test examples. Quadratic programming problems governed by liner evolution problems are investigated in Chapter 4. As in Chapter 3 we present a certified a-priori and a-posteriori error analysis. Moreover, we discuss basis update strategies. In Chapter 5 we give an outlook to further directions in reduced-order modeling in optimal control and optimization. More precisely, a nonlinear optimal control problem is studied. Moreover, state-constrained optimization problems are solved by a tailored combination of primal-dual active set methods and POD-aesed reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, POD Galerkin methods for multiobjective optimal control problems are investigated. Finally, some required theoretical foundations are summarized in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact manifold $\mathcal M$ with boundary of dimension $n\geq 3$ and any integers $K$ and $N$, we show that there exists a metric on $\mathcal M$ for which the first $K$ nonconstant eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on $\partial\mathcal M$ have at least $N$ nodal components. This provides a negative answer to the question of whether the number of nodal domains of Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions satisfies a Courant-type bound, which has been featured in recent surveys by Girouard and Polterovich [21, Open problem 9] and by Colbois, Girouard, Gordon and Sher [9, Open question 10.14].</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose in this paper is to prove end point Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation in the exterior domain of a generic non-trapping obstacle in the case $n \geq 3.$ In the case $n=2$ we have the same range of Strichartz estimates as in the free case. In this version we corrected some misprints from the previous one.</description>

      <title>Finite time/Infinite time blow-up behaviors for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.13214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the following focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{align*}
i\partial_t u+\Delta u +|x|^{-b}|u|^p u=0,\quad (t, x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^N \end{align*} with $0&lt;b&lt;\mbox{min}\{2, N\}$ and $\frac{4-2b}{N}&lt;p&lt;\frac{4-2b}{N-2}$. Assume that $u_0 \in H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and beyond the ground state threshold, then we prove the following two statements,
  (1) when $\frac{4-2b}{N}&lt;p&lt; \min\{\frac{4}{N}, \frac{4-2b}{N-2}\}$, or $p =\frac{4}{N}$ when $b \in (0, \frac 4 N)$,
then the corresponding solution blows up in finite time;
  (2) when $\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt;\frac{4-2b}{N-2}$, we prove the finite or infinite time blow-up. Moreover, we can further obtain a precise lower bound of infinite time blow-up rate, that is \begin{equation*}
  \sup_{t\in[0,T]}\|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}\gtrsim T^{\kappa},\quad \mbox{for some} \quad \kappa&gt;0. \end{equation*}
  To our knowledge, the statement (1) establishes the first finite time blow-up result for this equation in the intercritical case when the initial data $u_0$ doesn't have finite variance and is non-radial. The statement (2) gives the first result for the infinite time blow-up rate for this equation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and unenhanced dampings of the Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, Kolmogorov flow represents the stationary sinusoidal solution $(\sin y,0)$ to a two-dimensional spatially periodic Navier-Stokes system, driven by an external force. This system admits the additional non-stationary solution $(\sin y,0)+e^{-\nu t} (\sin y,0)$, which tends exponentially to the Kolmogorov flow at the minimum decay rate determined by the viscosity $\nu$. Enhanced damping or enhanced dissipation of the problem is obtained by presenting higher decay rate for the difference between a solution and the non-stationary basic solution. Moreover, for the understanding of the metastability problem in an explicit manner, a variety of exact solutions are presented to show enhanced and unenhanced dampings.</description>

Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of Green functions for the Cheeger $Q$-Laplacian in metric measure spaces that are Ahlfors $Q$-regular and support a $Q$-Poincar\'e inequality with $Q&gt;1$. We prove uniqueness of Green functions both in the case of relatively compact domains, and in the global (unbounded) case. We also prove existence of global Green functions in unbounded spaces, complementing the existing results in relatively compact domains proved recently in [BBL20].</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limits for kinetic equations preserving mass, momentum and energy: a spectral and unified approach in the presence of a spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triggered by the fact that, in the hydrodynamic limit, several different kinetic equations of physical interest all lead to the same Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, we develop in the paper an abstract framework which allows to explain this phenomenon. The method we develop can be seen as a significant improvement of known approaches for which we fully exploit some structural assumptions on the linear and nonlinear collision operators as well as a good knowledge of the Cauchy theory for the limiting equation. {In particular, we fully exploit the fact that the collision operator is preserving both momentum and kinetic energy.} We adopt a perturbative framework in a Hilbert space setting and first develop a general and fine spectral analysis of the linearized operator and its associated semigroup. Then, we introduce a splitting adapted to the various regimes (kinetic, acoustic, hydrodynamic) present in the kinetic equation which allows, by a fixed point argument, to construct a solution to the kinetic equation and prove the convergence towards suitable solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. Our approach is robust enough to treat, in the same formalism, the case of the Boltzmann equation with hard and moderately soft potentials, with and without cut-off assumptions, as well as the Landau equation for hard and moderately soft potentials in presence of a spectral gap. New well-posedness and strong convergence results are obtained within this framework. In particular, for initial data with algebraic decay with respect to the velocity variable, our approach provides the first result concerning the strong Navier-Stokes limit from Boltzmann equation without Grad cut-off assumption or Landau equation. The method developed in the paper is also robust enough to apply, at least at the linear level, to quantum kinetic equations for Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a smooth time-dependent real potential on the two-dimensional torus, decaying as time tends to infinity in Sobolev norms along with all its time derivative, and we exhibit a smooth solution to the associated Schr\"odinger equation on the two-dimensional torus whose $H^s$ norms nevertheless grow logarithmically as time tends to infinity. We use Fourier decomposition in order to exhibit a discrete resonant system of interactions, which we are further able to reduce to a sequence of finite-dimensional linear systems along which the energy propagates to higher and higher frequencies. The constructions are very explicit and we can thus obtain lower bounds on the growth rate of the solution.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical analysis of an elapsed time model with strongly coupled neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we first deal with the case when transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case when there exists a distributed delay that depends on previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Then we study the well-posedness and the numerical analysis of the elapsed time models. For existence and uniqueness we improve the previous works by relaxing some hypothesis on the nonlinearity, including the strongly excitatory case, while for the numerical analysis we prove that the approximation given by the explicit upwind scheme converges to the solution of the non-linear problem. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of least energy solutions to the fractional Lane-Emden equation in the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of least-energy solutions for a class of semilinear equations driven by the fractional laplacian, under homogeneous Dirichlet exterior conditions, when the underlying domain is a ball $B \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. The nonlinearity is of the form $$ f(u) = \lambda u + u^p,$$ where $p$ is superlinear and subcritical, and $\lambda &lt; \lambda_1(B)$, where $\lambda_1(B)$ is the first eigenvalue of the fractional laplacian in $B$. For $\lambda= 0$, we recover the fractional Lane-Emden equation. The proof makes use of Morse theory, and is inspired by some results obtained by C. S. Lin in the '90s.</description>

      <title>On Runge type theorems for solutions to strongly uniformly parabolic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_1, G_2 $ be domains in ${\mathbb R}^{n+1}$, $n \geq 2$, such that $G_1 \subset G_2$ and the domain $G_1$ have rather regular boundary. We investigate the problem of approximation of solutions to strongly uniformly $2m$-parabolic system $\mathcal L$ in the domain $G_1$ by solutions to the same system in the domain $G_2$. First, we prove that the space $S _{\mathcal L}(G_2)$ of solutions to the system $\mathcal L$ in the domain $G_2$ is dense in the space $S _{\mathcal L}(G_1)$, endowed with the standard Fr\'echet topology of the uniform convergence on compact subsets in $G_1$, if and only if the complements $G_2 (t) \setminus G_1 (t)$ have no non-empty compact components in $G_2 (t)$ for each $t\in \mathbb R$, where $G_j (t) = \{x \in {\mathbb R}^n: (x,t) \in G_j\}$. Next, under additional assumptions on the regularity of the bounded domains $G_1$ and $G_1(t)$, we prove that solutions from the Lebesgue class $L^2(G_1)\cap S _{\mathcal L}(G_1)$ can be approximated by solutions from $S _{\mathcal L}(G_2)$ if and only if the same assumption on the complements $G_2 (t) \setminus G_1 (t)$, $t\in \mathbb R$, is fulfilled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of recovering a connection on a complex vector bundle over a compact smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary from a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map at a high fixed frequency. We construct Gaussian beams using the language of jet bundles and show that their value at the boundary can be recovered from those DN maps. This allows us to show injectivity up to gauge on manifolds whose non-abelian X-ray transform is injective. We also study DN maps with a cubic nonlinearity and show how to recover the broken non-abelian X-ray transform from them. This transform maps a connection to its parallel transport along broken geodesics with endpoints on the boundary. We show that the broken non-abelian X-ray transform is always injective up to gauge equivalence, regardless of the manifold's geometry.</description>

Abstract: We use a version of the Skorokhod integral to give a simple and rigorous formulation of the Wick-ordered (stochastic) heat equation with planar white noise, representing the free energy of an undirected random polymer. The solution for all times is expressed as the L1 limit of a martingale given by the Feyman-Kac formula and defines a randomized shift, or Gaussian multiplicative chaos. The fluctuations far from the centre are shown to be given by the one-dimensional KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Global exterior stability of the Minkowski space: coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>
