      <title>Flow of the zeros of polynomials under iterated differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of polynomials $Q_n$ of degree $n$, we consider the triangular table of derivatives $Q_{n, k}(x)=d^k Q_n(x) /d x^k$. Under the only assumption that the sequence $\{Q_n\}$ has a weak* limiting zero distribution (an empirical distribution of zeros) represented by a unit measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, we show that as $n, k \rightarrow \infty$ such that $k / n \rightarrow t \in(0,1)$, the Cauchy transform of the zero-counting measure of the polynomials $Q_{n, k}$ converges in a neighborhood of infinity to the Cauchy transform of a measure $\mu_t$.
  The family of measures $\mu_t $, $t \in(0,1)$, whose dependence on the parameter $t$ can be interpreted as a flow of the zeros under iterated differentiation, has several interesting connections with the inviscid Burgers equation, the fractional free convolution of $\mu_0$, or a nonlocal diffusion equation governing the density of $\mu_t$ on $\mathbb R$.
  The main goal of this paper is to provide a streamlined and elementary proof of all these facts.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to the convergence problem for periodic dispersive equations with a polynomial symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of Carleson's convergence problem for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation $i\, \partial_t u + (-\Delta)^{a/2}u=0$ with $a &gt; 1$ in $\mathbb R^d$, which has Fourier symbol $P(\xi) = |\xi|^a$, it is known that the Sobolev exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is sufficient, but it is not known whether this condition is necessary. In this article, we show that in the periodic problem in $\mathbb T^d$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is necessary for all non-singular polynomial symbols $P$ regardless of the degree of $P$. Among the differential operators covered, we highlight the natural powers of the Laplacian $\Delta^k$ for $k \in \mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Explicit bounds for Bell numbers and their ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of Bell numbers, enhancing and unifying various results previously dispersed in the literature. We establish several explicit lower and upper bounds. The main results correspond to two asymptotic forms expressed by means of the Lambert $W$ function. As an application, some straightforward elementary bounds are derived. Additionally, an absolute convergence rate of the ratio of the consecutive Bell numbers is derived. The main challenge was to obtain satisfactory constants, as the Bell numbers grow rapidly, while the convergence rates are rather slow.</description>

      <title>Residue class biases in unrestricted partitions, partitions into distinct parts, and overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove specific biases in the number of occurrences of parts belonging to two different residue classes $a$ and $b$, modulo a fixed non-negative integer $m$, for the sets of unrestricted partitions, partitions into distinct parts, and overpartitions. These biases follow from inequalities for residue-weighted partition functions for the respective sets of partitions. We also establish asymptotic formulas for the numbers of partitions of size $n$ that belong to these sets of partitions and have a symmetric residue bias (i.e., for $1\le a&lt;m/2$ and $b=m-a$), as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On Iverson's law of similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iverson (2006) proposed the law of similarity \[ \xi_{s}(\lambda x)= \gamma(\lambda, s)\xi_{\eta(\lambda, s)}(x) \] for the sensitivity functions $\xi_{s}\, (s\in S)$. Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here $\gamma$ and $\eta$ can also depend on the variables $\lambda$ and $s$. In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson's law of similarity on its own. At first we show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then $\xi$ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation.
  Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016), in the second part of the third section we study the above model assuming that the mapping $\eta$ is multiplicatively translational. First, we show how these mappings can be characterized. Later on we turn to the examination of the so-called power law. According to our results, the corresponding function $\xi$ then does not have a Fechnerian representation, but it do have a subtractive representation. As an application of the results of the subsection, we close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property.</description>

      <title>A bilinear approach to the finite field restriction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ denote the $3$-dimensional paraboloid over a finite field of odd characteristic in which $-1$ is not a square. We show that the associated Fourier extension operator maps $L^2$ to $L^{r}$ for $r &gt; \frac{24}{7} \approx 3.428$. Previously this was known (in the case of prime order fields) for $r &gt; \frac{188}{53} \approx 3.547$. In contrast with much of the recent progress on this problem, our argument does not use state-of-the-art incidence estimates but rather proceeds by obtaining estimates on a related bilinear operator. These estimates are based on a geometric result that, roughly speaking, states that a set of points in the finite plane $F^2$ can be decomposed as a union of sets each of which either contains a controlled number of rectangles or a controlled number of trapezoids.</description>

Abstract: In this work, for the range $\frac{n-1}{n} &lt; p \leq 1$, we give a molecular reconstruction theorem for $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^n)$. As an application of this result and the atomic decomposition developed by S. Boza and M. Carro in [Proc. R. Soc. Edinb., 132 A (1) (2002), 25-43], we prove that the discrete Riesz potential $I_{\alpha}$ defined on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a bounded operator $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^n) \to H^q(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for $\frac{n-1}{n} &lt; p &lt; \frac{n}{\alpha}$ and $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{\alpha}{n}$, where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial progressions in topological fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in K[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, no constant terms and coefficients in a general locally compact topological field $K$. We give a quantitative count of the number of polynomial progressions $x, x+P_1(y), \ldots, x + P_m(y)$ lying in a set $S\subseteq K$ of positive density. The proof relies on a general $L^{\infty}$ inverse theorem which is of independent interest. This inverse theorem implies a Sobolev improving estimate for multilinear polynomial averaging operators which in turn implies our quantitative estimate for polynomial progressions. This general Sobolev inequality has the potential to be applied in a number of problems in real, complex and $p$-adic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially-algebraic (D-algebraic) functions are solutions of polynomial equations in the function, its derivatives, and the independent variables. We revisit closure properties of these functions by providing constructive proofs. We present algorithms to compute algebraic differential equations for compositions and arithmetic manipulations of univariate D-algebraic functions and derive bounds for the order of the resulting differential equations. We apply our methods to examples in the sciences.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Blow-up behavior for ODEs with normally hyperbolic nature in dynamics at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe blow-up behavior for ODEs by means of dynamics at infinity with complex asymptotic behavior in autonomous systems, as well as in nonautonomous systems. Based on preceding studies, a variant of closed embeddings of phase spaces and the time-scale transformation determined by the structure of vector fields at infinity reduce our description of blow-ups to unravel the shadowing property of (pre)compact trajectories on the horizon, the geometric object expressing the infinity, with the specific convergence rates. Geometrically, this description is organized by asymptotic phase of invariant sets on the horizon. Blow-up solutions in nonautonomous systems can be described in a similar way. As a corollary, normally, or partially hyperbolic invariant manifolds on the horizon possessing asymptotic phase are shown to induce blow-ups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Escape from a potential well occurs in a wide variety of physical systems from chemical reactions to ship capsize. In these situations escape often occurs by passage over a normally hyperbolic submanifold (NHS). This paper describes the computational implementation of an algorithm to identify the NHS of a two degree of freedom model for ship motion under the influence of damping and aperiodic forcing. Additionally we demonstrate how the stable manifolds of these submanifolds can be used to classify initial ship states as safe or unsafe.</description>

      <title>Sharp density discrepancy for cut and project sets: An approach via lattice point counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cut and project sets are obtained by taking an irrational slice of a lattice and projecting it to a lower dimensional subspace, and are fully characterised by the shape of the slice (window) and the choice of the lattice. In this context we seek to quantify fluctuations from the asymptotics for point counts. We obtain uniform upper bounds on the discrepancy depending on the diophantine properties of the lattice as well as universal lower bounds on the average of the discrepancy. In an appendix, Michael Bj\"orklund and Tobias Hartnick obtain lower bounds on the $L^2$-norm of the discrepancy also depending on the diophantine class; these lower bounds match our uniform upper bounds and both are therefore sharp. Using the sufficient criteria of Burago--Kleiner and Aliste-Prieto--Coronel--Gambaudo we find an explicit full-measure class of cut and project sets that are biLipschitz equivalent to lattices; the lower bounds on the variance indicate that this is the largest class of cut and project sets for which those sufficient criteria can apply.</description>

Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{D_n}{m^n} $$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(-1)^nA_n$ modulo $p^3$, where $p$ is an odd prime representable by some suitable binary quadratic form, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$, $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$, $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}k\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ and $A_n$ is the Ap\'ery number given by $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k^2$.</description>
