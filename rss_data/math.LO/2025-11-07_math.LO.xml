      <title>Topological semantics for a non-self-extensional LFI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have introduced a Logic of Formal Inconsistency (LFI) that we call $\vd$. This logic is non-self-extensional, i.e., the replacement property, or the rule for substitution of equivalents, does not hold. A Hilbert-style presentation for the logic has been provided. Then, a topological semantics for $\vd$ has been described, subsequent to which we have established the Soundness and Completeness results for it with respect to this semantics.</description>

      <title>Computability for tree presentations of continuum-size structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize an existing computability-theoretic method of presenting first-order structures whose domains have the cardinality of the continuum. Work using these methods until now has emphasized their topological properties. We shift the focus to first-order properties, using computable structure theory (on countable structures) as a guide. We present three basic questions to be asked when a structure is presented as the set of paths through a computable tree, as in our definition, and also propose the concept of tree-decidability as an analogue to the notion of decidability for a countable structure. As examples, we prove decidability results for certain additive and multiplicative groups of $p$-adic integers, products of these (such as the profinite completion of $\mathbb Z$), and the field of real numbers.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Goodstein's theorem and Cichon's independence proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Goodstein's theorem (Goodstein 1944) and Cichon's independence proof (Cichon 1983) to $\Pi^1_1-\mathrm{CA}_0$ using results from (Wilken 2026). The method is generalizable to stronger notation systems that provide unique terms for ordinals and enjoy Bachmann property.</description>

      <title>An Automated Theorem Generator with Theoretical Foundation Based on Rectangular Standard Contradiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical system for systematically generating non-trivial and logically valid theorems. Addressing this critical gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy (the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause). Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement $H$, a valid theorem $A \vdash \neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is developed. This research enables machines to transition from "verifiers" to "discoverers", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of logic and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Relation on ${(\omega, &lt;)}$ of Intermediate Degree Spectrum on a Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the degree spectra of relations on ${(\omega, &lt;)}$. Given an additional relation $R$ on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$, such as the successor relation, the degree spectrum of $R$ is the set of Turing degrees of $R$ in computable copies of ${(\omega,&lt;)}$. It is known that all degree spectra of relations on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$ fall into one of four categories: the computable degree, all of the c.e. degrees, all of the $\Delta^0_2$ degrees, or intermediate between the c.e. degrees and the $\Delta^0_2$ degrees. Examples of the first three degree spectra are easy to construct and well-known, but until recently it was open whether there is a relation with intermediate degree spectrum on a cone. Bazhenov, Kaloci\'{n}ski, and Wroclawski constructed an example of an intermediate degree spectrum, but their example is unnatural in the sense that it is constructed by diagonalization and thus not canonical, that is, which relation you obtain from their construction depends on which G\"odel encoding (and hence order of enumeration) of the partial computable functions / programs you choose. In this paper, we use the ''on-a-cone'' paradigm to restrict our attention to "natural" relations $R$. Our main result is a construction of a natural relation on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$ which has intermediate degree spectrum. This relation has intermediate degree spectrum because of structural reasons.</description>

      <title>On the computability of optimal Scott sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a countable mathematical structure, its Scott sentence is a sentence of the infinitary logic $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ that characterizes it among all countable structures. We can measure the complexity of a structure by the least complexity of a Scott sentence for that structure. It is known that there can be a difference between the least complexity of a Scott sentence and the least complexity of a computable Scott sentence; for example, Alvir, Knight, and McCoy showed that there is a computable structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence but no computable $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence. It is well known that a structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence must have a computable $\Pi_4$ Scott sentence. We show that this is best possible: there is a computable structure with a $\Pi_2$ Scott sentence but no computable $\Sigma_4$ Scott sentence. We also show that there is no reasonable characterization of the computable structures with a computable $\Pi_n$ Scott sentence by showing that the index set of such structures is $\Pi^1_1$-$m$-complete.</description>

      <title>Relative to any non-arithmetic set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a countable structure $\mathcal{A}$, the degree spectrum of $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all Turing degrees which can compute an isomorphic copy of $\mathcal{A}$. One of the major programs in computable structure theory is to determine which (upwards closed, Borel) classes of degrees form a degree spectrum. We resolve one of the major open problems in this area by showing that the non-arithmetic degrees are a degree spectrum. Our main new tool is a new form of unfriendly jump inversions where the back-and-forth types are maximally complicated. This new tool has several other applications.</description>

      <title>Uniform first order interpretation of the second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the first order theory of the homeomorphism group of a compact manifold interprets the full second order theory of countable groups of homeomorphisms of the manifold. The interpretation is uniform across manifolds of bounded dimension. As a consequence, many classical problems in group theory and geometry (e.g.~the linearity of mapping classes of compact $2$--manifolds) are encoded as elementary properties of homeomorphism groups of manifolds. Furthermore, the homeomorphism group uniformly interprets the Borel and projective hierarchies of the homeomorphism group, which gives a characterization of definable subsets of the homeomorphism group. Finally, we prove analogues of Rice's Theorem from computability theory for homeomorphism groups of manifolds. As a consequence, it follows that the collection of sentences that isolate the homeomorphism group of a particular manifold, or that isolate the homeomorphism groups of manifolds in general, is not definable in second order arithmetic, and that membership of particular sentences in these collections cannot be proved in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Non-singular and probability measure-preserving actions of infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two theorems in the ergodic theory of infinite permutation groups. First, generalizing a theorem of Nessonov for the infinite symmetric group, we show that every non-singular action of a non-archimedean, Roelcke precompact, Polish group on a measure space $(\Omega, \mu)$ admits an invariant $\sigma$-finite measure equivalent to $\mu$. Second, we prove the following de Finetti type theorem: if $G \curvearrowright M$ is a primitive permutation group with no algebraicity verifying an additional uniformity assumption, which is automatically satisfied if $G$ is Roelcke precompact, then any $G$-invariant, ergodic probability measure on $Z^M$, where $Z$ is a Polish space, is a product measure.</description>
