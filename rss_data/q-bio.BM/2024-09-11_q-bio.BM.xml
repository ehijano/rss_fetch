      <title>Multi-variable control to mitigate loads in CRISPRa networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of CRISPR-mediated gene activation (CRISPRa) has transformed the way in which we perform genetic screening, bioproduction and therapeutics through its ability to scale and multiplex. However, the emergence of loads on the key molecular resources constituting CRISPRa by the orthogonal short RNA that guide such resources to gene targets, couple theoretically independent CRISPRa modules. This coupling negates the ability of CRISPRa systems to concurrently regulate multiple genes independent of one another. In this paper, we propose to reduce this coupling by mitigating the loads on the molecular resources that constitute CRISPRa. In particular, we design a multi-variable controller that makes the concentration of these molecular resources robust to variations in the level of the short RNA loads. This work serves as a foundation to design and implement CRISPRa controllers for practical applications.</description>

      <title>ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on AI-Guided Molecular Simulations in VR: Exploring Strategies for Imitation Learning in Hyperdimensional Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently been developed as a 'human-in-the-loop' strategy, which leverages high-performance computing to accelerate the researcher's ability to solve the hyperdimensional sampling problem. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular motion, iMD-VR enables researchers and students to efficiently and intuitively explore and navigate these complex, high-dimensional systems. iMD-VR platforms offer a unique opportunity to quickly generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the possibility of employing user-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL is an important technique in robotics that enables agents to mimic complex behaviors from expert demonstrations, thus circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. We review the utilization of IL for manipulation tasks in robotics and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models for solving specific molecular 'tasks'. We then investigate how such approaches could be applied to the data captured from iMD-VR recordings. Finally, we outline the future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise to efficiently navigate conformational spaces, highlighting how this approach could provide valuable insight across domains such as materials science, protein engineering, and computer-aided drug design.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Guidance for Discrete Diffusion Models for Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training-free guidance methods for continuous data have seen an explosion of interest due to the fact that they enable foundation diffusion models to be paired with interchangable guidance models. Currently, equivalent guidance methods for discrete diffusion models are unknown. We present a framework for applying training-free guidance to discrete data and demonstrate its utility on molecular graph generation tasks using the discrete diffusion model architecture of DiGress. We pair this model with guidance functions that return the proportion of heavy atoms that are a specific atom type and the molecular weight of the heavy atoms and demonstrate our method's ability to guide the data generation.</description>
