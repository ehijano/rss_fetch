      <title>Glueball mass spectrum at finite temperature revisited: Constant contribution in glueball correlators in the deconfinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the glueball properties at finite temperature from the temporal correlation in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory using anisotropic lattice QCD. Although the existence of a constant contribution to the meson correlation function appearing in the deconfinement phase are known, its effect on the glueball correlation function at finite temperature has not been considered in previous studies. The present study reveals that the constant contribution to the glueball correlation function actually occurs in the three lowest-lying glueball states, corresponding to the $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ glueballs, from near the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition $T_C$ to the high temperature side. If the existence of constant terms is taken into account in the standard pole-mass analysis, it is observed that the pole-mass of the glueball ground state remains unchanged below $T_c$ and then increases with temperature above $T_C$. The result indicates that the true temperature dependence of the glueball mass above $T_C$ is opposite to the results of the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of smoothening flows for the topological charge in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the topological charge for several SU(NC) gauge field ensembles for NC = 4, 5, 6 with a single fermion in the two-index anti-symmetric representation, covering multiple lattice spacings at otherwise approximately constant physical parameters. Comparing the topological charge defined by the Wilson flow and the over-improved DBW2 flow we find that already at small flow times the latter stabilises on discrete values. We provide evidence that as the lattice spacing is lowered the Wilson flow also separates into discrete sectors at earlier flow times. Adopting the DWB2 definition in the remainder of the analysis, we do not see any evidence of fractional topological charges, which could in principle appear at finite lattice spacing.</description>

      <title>Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions and reconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et al., using the Wilson fermion formalism. These operators commute with the Hamiltonian and become the generators of vector and axial $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries in the continuum limit. An interesting feature of the axial charge operator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in momentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted as fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in the continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry. We construct a Hamiltonian using the eigenstates of the axial charge operator, preserving exact axial symmetry on the lattice and vector symmetry in the continuum. As applications, we examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism in the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models. Our formulation supports symmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges, although further numerical studies are required to verify the SMG mechanism in interacting models.</description>

      <title>Extracting Meson Distribution Amplitudes from Nonlocal Euclidean Correlations at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete result for the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) hard matching kernel indispensable for a precision extraction of light meson distribution amplitudes from lattice calculations of equal-time nonlocal Euclidean correlation functions. The results are given in both coordinate and momentum space, with the renormalization and matching accomplished in a state-of-the-art scheme. Our results can be used in both large-momentum effective theory and short-distance factorization approaches. Notably, our coordinate space kernel is directly applicable to nonsinglet quark unpolarized and helicity generalized parton distributions as well. We also illustrate the numerical impact of the NNLO matching, using the pion distribution amplitude as an example.</description>

      <title>Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which is difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflect scaling dimensions of individual field operators. This disentangling is demonstrated explicitly for conformal field theories. The scheme is first tested on the critical point of the 2D Ising model, where the two primary scaling dimensions and their respective two lowest descendant dimensions are extracted. The 3D Ising model is studied next, revealing the two relevant primaries and their lowest descendants to high precision. The 2D tricritical Ising point is studied with the Blume-Capel model. Here the scaling dimensions of all three symmetric primary operators are successfully isolated along with the leading descendants. The eigenvectors are also studied and give useful information on the boundary between the ordered and disordered phases in the neighborhood of the tricritical point. Finally, the crossover from regular to tricritical Ising scaling is investigated on several points on the phase boundary of the Blume-Capel model away from its tricritical point. The scaling of the eigenvalues corresponding to tricritical descendant operators are found to be remarkably stable even far from the tricritical point. The covariance method represents a simple extension of standard analysis of correlation functions and can significantly enhance the utility of Monte Carlo simulations and other computational methods in studies of criticality, in particular conformal critical points.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the magnetic moments of singly charmed baryons from lattice QCD simulations and the experimental decay widths of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Sigma_c^*$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections make significant contributions to the polarizabilities. Additionally, the magnetic dipole transitions $\mathcal{B}_6^* \to \mathcal{B}_6 +\gamma $ also provide large contribution to the magnetic polarizabilities.</description>
