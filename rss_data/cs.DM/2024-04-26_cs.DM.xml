      <title>FO logic on cellular automata orbits equals MSO logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of classical cellular automata (CA) to arbitrary labeled graphs, and show that FO logic on CA orbits is equivalent to MSO logic.  We deduce various results from that equivalence, including a characterization of finitely generated groups on which FO model checking for CA orbits is undecidable, and undecidability of satisfiability of a fixed FO property for CA over finite graphs. We also show concrete examples of FO formulas for CA orbits whose model checking problem is equivalent to the domino problem, or its seeded or recurring variants respectively, on any finitely generated group. For the recurring domino problem, we use an extension of the FO signature by a relation found in the well-known Garden of Eden theorem, but we also show a concrete FO formula without the extension and with one quantifier alternation whose model checking problem does not belong to the arithmetical hierarchy on group Z^2.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>When does a bent concatenation not belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every Boolean bent function $f$ can be written either as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2$ of two complementary semi-bent functions $f_1,f_2$; or as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$ of four Boolean functions $f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4$, all of which are simultaneously bent, semi-bent, or 5-valued spectra-functions. In this context, it is essential to ask: When does a bent concatenation $f$ (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class $\mathcal{M}^\#$? In this article, we answer this question completely by providing a full characterization of the structure of $\mathcal{M}$-subspaces for the concatenation of the form $f=f_1||f_2$ and $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$, which allows us to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions so that $f$ is outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$. Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit design methods of specifying bent functions outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$ in the special case when $f=g||h||g||(h+1)$, where $g$ and $h$ are bent functions.</description>

      <title>Vertex Ranking of Degenerate Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $\ell$-vertex-ranking of a graph $G$ is a colouring of the vertices of $G$ with integer colours so that in any connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ with diameter at most $\ell$, there is a vertex in $H$ whose colour is larger than that of every other vertex in $H$. The $\ell$-vertex-ranking number, $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has an $\ell$-vertex-ranking using $k$ colours. We prove that, for any fixed $d$ and $\ell$, every $d$-degenerate $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)= O(n^{1-2/(\ell+1)}\log n)$ if $\ell$ is even and $\chi_{\ell-\mathrm{vr}}(G)= O(n^{1-2/\ell}\log n)$ if $\ell$ is odd. The case $\ell=2$ resolves (up to the $\log n$ factor) an open problem posed by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} and the cases $\ell\in\{2,3\}$ are asymptotically optimal (up to the $\log n$ factor).</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithm of Minimum All-Ones Problem for Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph and let each vertex of $G$ has a lamp and a button. Each button can be of $\sigma^+$-type or $\sigma$-type.
  Assume that initially some lamps are on and others are off. The button on vertex $x$ is of $\sigma^+$-type ($\sigma$-type, respectively) if pressing the button changes the lamp states on $x$ and on its neighbors in $G$ (the lamp states on the neighbors of $x$ only, respectively). Assume that there is a set $X\subseteq V$ such that pressing buttons on vertices of $X$ lights all lamps on vertices of $G$. In particular, it is known to hold when initially all lamps are off and all buttons are of $\sigma^+$-type.
  Finding such a set $X$ of the smallest size is NP-hard even if initially all lamps are off and all buttons are of $\sigma^+$-type. Using a linear algebraic approach we design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the problem such that for the set $X$ constructed by the algorithm, we have $|X|\le \min\{r,(|V|+{\rm opt})/2\},$ where $r$ is the rank of a (modified) adjacent matrix of $G$ and ${\rm opt}$ is the size of an optimal solution to the problem.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the problem with a nontrivial approximation guarantee.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic spectrum distance, graph limits, and the Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the Shannon capacity of graphs is a long-standing open problem in information theory, graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Over decades, a wide range of upper and lower bound methods have been developed to analyze this problem. However, despite tremendous effort, even small instances of the problem have remained open.
  In recent years, a new dual characterization of the Shannon capacity of graphs, asymptotic spectrum duality, has unified and extended known upper bound methods and structural theorems. In this paper, building on asymptotic spectrum duality, we develop a new theory of graph distance, that we call asymptotic spectrum distance, and corresponding limits (reminiscent of, but different from, the celebrated theory of cut-norm, graphons and flag algebras). We propose a graph limit approach to the Shannon capacity problem: to determine the Shannon capacity of a graph, construct a sequence of easier to analyse graphs converging to it.
  (1) We give a very general construction of non-trivial converging sequences of graphs (in a family of circulant graphs).
  (2) We construct Cauchy sequences of finite graphs that do not converge to any finite graph, but do converge to an infinite graph. We establish strong connections between convergence questions of finite graphs and the asymptotic properties of Borsuk-like infinite graphs on the circle.
  (3) We observe that all best-known lower bound constructions for Shannon capacity of small odd cycles can be obtained from a "finite" version of the graph limit approach. We develop computational and theoretical aspects of this approach and use these to obtain a new Shannon capacity lower bound for the fifteen-cycle.
  The theory of asymptotic spectrum distance applies not only to Shannon capacity of graphs; indeed, we will develop it for a general class of mathematical objects and their asymptotic properties.</description>

      <title>Framework for $\exists \mathbb{R}$-Completeness of Two-Dimensional Packing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim in packing problems is to decide if a given set of pieces can be placed inside a given container. A packing problem is defined by the types of pieces and containers to be handled, and the motions that are allowed to move the pieces. The pieces must be placed so that in the resulting placement, they are pairwise interior-disjoint. We establish a framework which enables us to show that for many combinations of allowed pieces, containers and motions, the resulting problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete. This means that the problem is equivalent (under polynomial time reductions) to deciding whether a given system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a real solution.
  We consider packing problems where only translations are allowed as the motions, and problems where arbitrary rigid motions are allowed, i.e., both translations and rotations. When rotations are allowed, we show that it is an $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete problem to decide if a set of convex polygons, each of which has at most $7$ corners, can be packed into a square. Restricted to translations, we show that the following problems are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete: (i) pieces bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves to be packed in a square, and (ii) convex polygons to be packed in a container bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves.</description>

      <title>Stable Homology-Based Cycle Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network centrality measures play a crucial role in understanding graph structures, assessing the importance of nodes, paths, or cycles based on directed or reciprocal interactions encoded by vertices and edges. Estrada and Ross extended these measures to simplicial complexes to account for higher-order connections. In this work, we introduce novel centrality measures by leveraging algebraically-computable topological signatures of cycles and their homological persistence. We apply tools from algebraic topology to extract multiscale signatures within cycle spaces of weighted graphs, tracking homology generators persisting across a weight-induced filtration of simplicial complexes built over point clouds. This approach incorporates persistent signatures and merge information of homology classes along the filtration, quantifying cycle importance not only by geometric and topological significance but also by homological influence on other cycles. We demonstrate the stability of these measures under small perturbations using an appropriate metric to ensure robustness in practical applications. Finally, we apply these measures to fractal-like point clouds, revealing their capability to detect information consistent with, and possibly overlooked by, common topological summaries.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with High Lift-and-Project Ranks for the Lov\'asz-Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'asz-Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$. In particular, we focus on a search for relatively small graphs with high $\text{LS}_+$-rank (i.e., the least number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We provide families of graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank is asymptotically a linear function of its number of vertices, which is the best possible up to improvements in the constant factor. This improves upon the previous best result in this direction from 1999, which yielded graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank only grew with the square root of the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Benders decomposition algorithms for minimizing the spread of harmful contagions in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a recent example for the spread of a harmful contagion in large populations. Moreover, the spread of harmful contagions is not only restricted to an infectious disease, but is also relevant to computer viruses and malware in computer networks. Furthermore, the spread of fake news and propaganda in online social networks is also of major concern. In this study, we introduce the measure-based spread minimization problem (MBSMP), which can help policy makers in minimizing the spread of harmful contagions in large networks. We develop exact solution methods based on branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms that make use of the application of Benders decomposition method to two different mixed-integer programming formulations of the MBSMP: an arc-based formulation and a path-based formulation. We show that for both formulations the Benders optimality cuts can be generated using a combinatorial procedure rather than solving the dual subproblems using linear programming. Additional improvements such as using scenario-dependent extended seed sets, initial cuts, and a starting heuristic are also incorporated into our branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms. We investigate the contribution of various components of the solution algorithms to the performance on the basis of computational results obtained on a set of instances derived from existing ones in the literature.</description>
