      <title>CAMformer: Associative Memory is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers face scalability challenges due to the quadratic cost of attention, which involves dense similarity computations between queries and keys. We propose CAMformer, a novel accelerator that reinterprets attention as an associative memory operation and computes attention scores using a voltage-domain Binary Attention Content Addressable Memory (BA-CAM). This enables constant-time similarity search through analog charge sharing, replacing digital arithmetic with physical similarity sensing. CAMformer integrates hierarchical two-stage top-k filtering, pipelined execution, and high-precision contextualization to achieve both algorithmic accuracy and architectural efficiency. Evaluated on BERT and Vision Transformer workloads, CAMformer achieves over 10x energy efficiency, up to 4x higher throughput, and 6-8x lower area compared to state-of-the-art accelerators--while maintaining near-lossless accuracy.</description>

      <title>Pickle Prefetcher: Programmable and Scalable Last-Level Cache Prefetcher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern high-performance architectures employ large last-level caches (LLCs). While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers.</description>

      <title>R3A: Reliable RTL Repair Framework with Multi-Agent Fault Localization and Stochastic Tree-of-Thoughts Patch Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20090v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repairing RTL bugs is crucial for hardware design and verification. Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.</description>

      <title>PrefixGPT: Prefix Adder Optimization by a Generative Pre-trained Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19472v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prefix adders are widely used in compute-intensive applications for their high speed. However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.</description>

      <title>Understanding Accelerator Compilers via Performance Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerator design languages (ADLs), high-level languages that compile to hardware units, help domain experts quickly design efficient application-specific hardware. ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.
  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler's decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal's cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs. We show that these insights can also guide developers toward optimizations that the compiler was unable to perform automatically, including a reduction by 46.9\% of total cycles for one application.</description>

      <title>QiMeng-CRUX: Narrowing the Gap between Natural Language and Verilog via Core Refined Understanding eXpression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20099v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Optimizing Multi-Stage AI Inference Pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.
  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Tiny Chiplets Enabled by Packaging Scaling: Opportunities in ESD Protection and Signal Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling of advanced packaging technologies provides abundant interconnection resources for 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integration (HI), thereby enabling the construction of larger-scale VLSI systems with higher energy efficiency in data movement. However, conventional input/output (I/O) circuitry, including electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and signaling, introduces significant area overhead. Prior studies have identified this overhead as a major constraint in reducing chiplet size below 100 mm2. In this study, we revisit reliability requirements from the perspective of chiplet interface design. Through parasitic extraction and simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulations, we demonstrate that ESD protection and inter-chiplet signaling can be substantially simplified in future 2.5D/3D packaging technologies. Such simplification, in turn, paves the road for further chiplet miniaturization and improves the composability and reusability of tiny chiplets.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4x and 3.85x lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications, our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.</description>

      <title>GPU-Initiated Networking for NCCL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.
  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.</description>
