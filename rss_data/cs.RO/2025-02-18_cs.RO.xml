      <title>A standardised platform for translational advances in fluidic soft systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft machines are poised to deliver significant real-world impact, with soft robotics emerging as a key sub-discipline. This field integrates biological inspiration, materials science, and embodied intelligence to create bio-robotic hybrids, blurring the boundary between engineered systems and biology. Over the past 15 years, research in fluidically controlled soft robots has led to commercialised systems that leverage "softness" to improve human-machine interaction or to handle delicate objects. However, translating laboratory advancements into scalable applications remains challenging due to difficulties in prototyping and manufacturing ultra-flexible materials, as well as the absence of standardised design processes. Here we show that the Flex Printer, an open-source, low-cost FDM platform, enables reliable printing of ultra-flexible soft robots with embedded fluidic logic. By employing an innovative upside-down print orientation, the system significantly expands the range of printable geometries. We demonstrate how this approach allows robots to autonomously walk off the print bed immediately after fabrication - a milestone achievement in soft robotics. This work provides a foundation for standardisation and scalable manufacturing, critical for accelerating the field's impact. More broadly, by lowering barriers to entry, this platform has the potential to democratise soft robotics research and facilitate the development of new applications. We invite the community to contribute to the shared development of this technology to drive the next wave of breakthroughs in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Prediction uncertainty-aware planning using deep ensembles and trajectory optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion is stochastic and ensuring safe robot navigation in a pedestrian-rich environment requires proactive decision-making. Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</description>

      <title>Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance in Human-Machine Shared Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-machine shared control in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. Additionally, the lack of guaranteed trajectory feasibility under extreme conditions can compromise safety and reliability. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a reinforcement learning agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</description>

      <title>Motion planning for highly-dynamic unconditioned reflexes based on chained Signed Distance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unconditioned reflex (e.g., protective reflex), which is the innate reaction of the organism and usually performed through the spinal cord rather than the brain, can enable organisms to escape harms from environments. In this paper, we propose an online, highly-dynamic motion planning algorithm to endow manipulators the highly-dynamic unconditioned reflexes to humans and/or environments. Our method is based on a chained version of Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), which can be pre-computed and stored. Our proposed algorithm is divided into two stages. In the offline stage, we create 3 groups of local SDFs to store the geometric information of the manipulator and its working environment. In the online stage, the pre-computed local SDFs are chained together according the configuration of the manipulator, to provide global geometric information about the environment. While the point clouds of the dynamic objects serve as query points to look up these local SDFs for quickly generating escape velocity. Then we propose a modified geometric Jacobian matrix and use the Jacobian-pseudo-inverse method to generate real-time reflex behaviors to avoid the static and dynamic obstacles in the environment. The benefits of our method are validated in both static and dynamic scenarios. In the static scenario, our method identifies the path solutions with lower time consumption and shorter trajectory length compared to existing solutions. In the dynamic scenario, our method can reliably pursue the dynamic target point, avoid dynamic obstacles, and react to these obstacles within 1ms, which surpasses the unconditioned reflex reaction time of humans.</description>

      <title>A Whole-Body Disturbance Rejection Control Framework for Dynamic Motions in Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a control framework for legged robots that enables self-perception and resistance to external disturbances and model uncertainties. First, a novel disturbance estimator is proposed, integrating adaptive control and extended state observers (ESO) to estimate external disturbances and model uncertainties. This estimator is embedded within the whole-body control framework to compensate for disturbances in the legged system. Second, a comprehensive whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (WB-DRC) is introduced, accounting for the robot's full-body dynamics. Compared to previous whole-body control frameworks, WB-DRC effectively handles external disturbances and model uncertainties, with the potential to adapt to complex terrain. Third, simulations of both biped and quadruped robots are conducted in the Gazebo simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on the quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the robot system using WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated co-design of robots through morphological pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-design of robot morphology and neural control typically requires using reinforcement learning to approximate a unique control policy gradient for each body plan, demanding massive amounts of training data to measure the performance of each design. Here we show that a universal, morphology-agnostic controller can be rapidly and directly obtained by gradient-based optimization through differentiable simulation. This process of morphological pretraining allows the designer to explore non-differentiable changes to a robot's physical layout (e.g. adding, removing and recombining discrete body parts) and immediately determine which revisions are beneficial and which are deleterious using the pretrained model. We term this process "zero-shot evolution" and compare it with the simultaneous co-optimization of a universal controller alongside an evolving design population. We find the latter results in diversity collapse, a previously unknown pathology whereby the population -- and thus the controller's training data -- converges to similar designs that are easier to steer with a shared universal controller. We show that zero-shot evolution with a pretrained controller quickly yields a diversity of highly performant designs, and by fine-tuning the pretrained controller on the current population throughout evolution, diversity is not only preserved but significantly increased as superior performance is achieved.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap for Athletic Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving athletic loco-manipulation on robots requires moving beyond traditional tracking rewards - which simply guide the robot along a reference trajectory - to task rewards that drive truly dynamic, goal-oriented behaviors. Commands such as "throw the ball as far as you can" or "lift the weight as quickly as possible" compel the robot to exhibit the agility and power inherent in athletic performance. However, training solely with task rewards introduces two major challenges: these rewards are prone to exploitation (reward hacking), and the exploration process can lack sufficient direction. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage training pipeline. First, we introduce the Unsupervised Actuator Net (UAN), which leverages real-world data to bridge the sim-to-real gap for complex actuation mechanisms without requiring access to torque sensing. UAN mitigates reward hacking by ensuring that the learned behaviors remain robust and transferable. Second, we use a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy that leverages reference trajectories as initial hints to guide exploration. With these innovations, our robot athlete learns to lift, throw, and drag with remarkable fidelity from simulation to reality.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Hard-to-Simulate Objectives for Quadruped Locomotion: A Case Study on Total Power Saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged locomotion is not just about mobility; it also encompasses crucial objectives such as energy efficiency, safety, and user experience, which are vital for real-world applications. However, key factors such as battery power consumption and stepping noise are often inaccurately modeled or missing in common simulators, leaving these aspects poorly optimized or unaddressed by current sim-to-real methods. Hand-designed proxies, such as mechanical power and foot contact forces, have been used to address these challenges but are often problem-specific and inaccurate.
  In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for fine-tuning locomotion policies, targeting these hard-to-simulate objectives. Our framework leverages real-world data to model these objectives and incorporates the learned model into simulation for policy improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on power saving for quadruped locomotion, achieving a significant 24-28\% net reduction in total power consumption from the battery pack at various speeds. In essence, our approach offers a versatile solution for optimizing hard-to-simulate objectives in quadruped locomotion, providing an easy-to-adapt paradigm for continual improving with real-world knowledge.

      <title>GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</description>

      <title>DFM: Deep Fourier Mimic for Expressive Dance Motion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As entertainment robots gain popularity, the demand for natural and expressive motion, particularly in dancing, continues to rise. Traditionally, dancing motions have been manually designed by artists, a process that is both labor-intensive and restricted to simple motion playback, lacking the flexibility to incorporate additional tasks such as locomotion or gaze control during dancing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Deep Fourier Mimic (DFM), a novel method that combines advanced motion representation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable smooth transitions between motions while concurrently managing auxiliary tasks during dance sequences. While previous frequency domain based motion representations have successfully encoded dance motions into latent parameters, they often impose overly rigid periodic assumptions at the local level, resulting in reduced tracking accuracy and motion expressiveness, which is a critical aspect for entertainment robots. By relaxing these locally periodic constraints, our approach not only enhances tracking precision but also facilitates smooth transitions between different motions. Furthermore, the learned RL policy that supports simultaneous base activities, such as locomotion and gaze control, allows entertainment robots to engage more dynamically and interactively with users rather than merely replaying static, pre-designed dance routines.</description>

      <title>Learning Quiet Walking for a Small Home Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As home robotics gains traction, robots are increasingly integrated into households, offering companionship and assistance. Quadruped robots, particularly those resembling dogs, have emerged as popular alternatives for traditional pets. However, user feedback highlights concerns about the noise these robots generate during walking at home, particularly the loud footstep sound. To address this issue, we propose a sim-to-real based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to minimize the foot contact velocity highly related to the footstep sound. Our framework incorporates three key elements: learning varying PD gains to actively dampen and stiffen each joint, utilizing foot contact sensors, and employing curriculum learning to gradually enforce penalties on foot contact velocity. Experiments demonstrate that our learned policy achieves superior quietness compared to a RL baseline and the carefully handcrafted Sony commercial controllers. Furthermore, the trade-off between robustness and quietness is shown. This research contributes to developing quieter and more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>AdaManip: Adaptive Articulated Object Manipulation Environments and Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articulated object manipulation is a critical capability for robots to perform various tasks in real-world scenarios. Composed of multiple parts connected by joints, articulated objects are endowed with diverse functional mechanisms through complex relative motions. For example, a safe consists of a door, a handle, and a lock, where the door can only be opened when the latch is unlocked. The internal structure, such as the state of a lock or joint angle constraints, cannot be directly observed from visual observation. Consequently, successful manipulation of these objects requires adaptive adjustment based on trial and error rather than a one-time visual inference. However, previous datasets and simulation environments for articulated objects have primarily focused on simple manipulation mechanisms where the complete manipulation process can be inferred from the object's appearance. To enhance the diversity and complexity of adaptive manipulation mechanisms, we build a novel articulated object manipulation environment and equip it with 9 categories of objects. Based on the environment and objects, we further propose an adaptive demonstration collection and 3D visual diffusion-based imitation learning pipeline that learns the adaptive manipulation policy. The effectiveness of our designs and proposed method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments. Our project page is available at: https://adamanip.github.io</description>

      <title>BFA: Best-Feature-Aware Fusion for Multi-View Fine-grained Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, multi-view cameras are typically employed for fine-grained manipulation tasks. Existing approaches (e.g., ACT) tend to treat multi-view features equally and directly concatenate them for policy learning. However, it will introduce redundant visual information and bring higher computational costs, leading to ineffective manipulation. For a fine-grained manipulation task, it tends to involve multiple stages while the most contributed view for different stages is varied over time. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play best-feature-aware (BFA) fusion strategy for multi-view manipulation tasks, which is adaptable to various policies. Built upon the visual backbone of the policy network, we design a lightweight network to predict the importance score of each view. Based on the predicted importance scores, the reweighted multi-view features are subsequently fused and input into the end-to-end policy network, enabling seamless integration. Notably, our method demonstrates outstanding performance in fine-grained manipulations. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms multiple baselines by 22-46% success rate on different tasks. Our work provides new insights and inspiration for tackling key challenges in fine-grained manipulations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Retrospective Framework in Multi-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial capabilities in enhancing communication and coordination in multi-robot systems. However, existing methods often struggle to achieve efficient collaboration and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, which are common in real-world multi-robot scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrospective actor-critic framework for multi-robot collaboration. This framework integrates two key components: (1) an actor that performs real-time decision-making based on observations and task directives, and (2) a critic that retrospectively evaluates the outcomes to provide feedback for continuous refinement, such that the proposed framework can adapt effectively to dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in task performance and adaptability. This work offers a robust solution to persistent challenges in robotic collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Learning Scoring Rules in Autonomous Driving Planning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving systems, motion planning is commonly implemented as a two-stage process: first, a trajectory proposer generates multiple candidate trajectories, then a scoring mechanism selects the most suitable trajectory for execution. For this critical selection stage, rule-based scoring mechanisms are particularly appealing as they can explicitly encode driving preferences, safety constraints, and traffic regulations in a formalized, human-understandable format. However, manually crafting these scoring rules presents significant challenges: the rules often contain complex interdependencies, require careful parameter tuning, and may not fully capture the nuances present in real-world driving data. This work introduces FLoRA, a novel framework that bridges this gap by learning interpretable scoring rules represented in temporal logic. Our method features a learnable logic structure that captures nuanced relationships across diverse driving scenarios, optimizing both rules and parameters directly from real-world driving demonstrations collected in NuPlan. Our approach effectively learns to evaluate driving behavior even though the training data only contains positive examples (successful driving demonstrations). Evaluations in closed-loop planning simulations demonstrate that our learned scoring rules outperform existing techniques, including expert-designed rules and neural network scoring models, while maintaining interpretability. This work introduces a data-driven approach to enhance the scoring mechanism in autonomous driving systems, designed as a plug-in module to seamlessly integrate with various trajectory proposers. Our video and code are available on xiong.zikang.me/FLoRA.</description>

      <title>HI-GVF: Shared Control based on Human-Influenced Guiding Vector Fields for Human-multi-robot Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-multi-robot shared control leverages human decision-making and robotic autonomy to enhance human-robot collaboration. While widely studied, existing systems often adopt a leader-follower model, limiting robot autonomy to some extent. Besides, a human is required to directly participate in the motion control of robots through teleoperation, which significantly burdens the operator. To alleviate these two issues, we propose a layered shared control computing framework using human-influenced guiding vector fields (HI-GVF) for human-robot collaboration. HI-GVF guides the multi-robot system along a desired path specified by the human. Then, an intention field is designed to merge the human and robot intentions, accelerating the propagation of the human intention within the multi-robot system. Moreover, we give the stability analysis of the proposed model and use collision avoidance based on safety barrier certificates to fine-tune the velocity. Eventually, considering the firefighting task as an example scenario, we conduct simulations and experiments using multiple human-robot interfaces (brain-computer interface, myoelectric wristband, eye-tracking), and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach boosts the effectiveness and performance of the task.</description>

      <title>Robot Deformable Object Manipulation via NMPC-generated Demonstrations in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conducted research on deformable object manipulation by robots based on demonstration-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL). To improve the learning efficiency of RL, we enhanced the utilization of demonstration data from multiple aspects and proposed the HGCR-DDPG algorithm. It uses a novel high-dimensional fuzzy approach for grasping-point selection, a refined behavior-cloning method to enhance data-driven learning in Rainbow-DDPG, and a sequential policy-learning strategy. Compared to the baseline algorithm (Rainbow-DDPG), our proposed HGCR-DDPG achieved 2.01 times the global average reward and reduced the global average standard deviation to 45% of that of the baseline algorithm. To reduce the human labor cost of demonstration collection, we proposed a low-cost demonstration collection method based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Simulation experiment results show that demonstrations collected through NMPC can be used to train HGCR-DDPG, achieving comparable results to those obtained with human demonstrations. To validate the feasibility of our proposed methods in real-world environments, we conducted physical experiments involving deformable object manipulation. We manipulated fabric to perform three tasks: diagonal folding, central axis folding, and flattening. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved success rates of 83.3%, 80%, and 100% for these three tasks, respectively, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to current large-model approaches for robot manipulation, the proposed algorithm is lightweight, requires fewer computational resources, and offers task-specific customization and efficient adaptability for specific tasks.</description>

      <title>PrivilegedDreamer: Explicit Imagination of Privileged Information for Rapid Adaptation of Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous real-world control problems involve dynamics and objectives affected by unobservable hidden pa- rameters, ranging from autonomous driving to robotic manipu- lation, which cause performance degradation during sim-to-real transfer. To represent these kinds of domains, we adopt hidden- parameter Markov decision processes (HIP-MDPs), which model sequential decision problems where hidden variables parameterize transition and reward functions. Existing ap- proaches, such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, and meta-learning, simply treat the effect of hidden param- eters as additional variance and often struggle to effectively handle HIP-MDP problems, especially when the rewards are parameterized by hidden variables. We introduce Privileged- Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that extends the existing model-based approach by incorporating an explicit parameter estimation module. PrivilegedDreamer features its novel dual recurrent architecture that explicitly estimates hidden parameters from limited historical data and enables us to condition the model, actor, and critic networks on these estimated parameters. Our empirical analysis on five diverse HIP-MDP tasks demonstrates that PrivilegedDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art model-based, model-free, and do- main adaptation learning algorithms. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to justify the inclusion of each component in the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Verti-Bench: A General and Scalable Off-Road Mobility Benchmark for Vertically Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancement in off-road autonomy has shown promises in deploying autonomous mobile robots in outdoor off-road environments. Encouraging results have been reported from both simulated and real-world experiments. However, unlike evaluating off-road perception tasks on static datasets, benchmarking off-road mobility still faces significant challenges due to a variety of factors, including variations in vehicle platforms and terrain properties. Furthermore, different vehicle-terrain interactions need to be unfolded during mobility evaluation, which requires the mobility systems to interact with the environments instead of comparing against a pre-collected dataset. In this paper, we present Verti-Bench, a mobility benchmark that focuses on extremely rugged, vertically challenging off-road environments. 100 unique off-road environments and 1000 distinct navigation tasks with millions of off-road terrain properties, including a variety of geometry and semantics, rigid and deformable surfaces, and large natural obstacles, provide standardized and objective evaluation in high-fidelity multi-physics simulation. Verti-Bench is also scalable to various vehicle platforms with different scales and actuation mechanisms. We also provide datasets from expert demonstration, random exploration, failure cases (rolling over and getting stuck), as well as a gym-like interface for reinforcement learning. We use Verti-Bench to benchmark ten off-road mobility systems, present our findings, and identify future off-road mobility research directions.</description>

      <title>Learning Dexterous Bimanual Catch Skills through Adversarial-Cooperative Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic catching has traditionally focused on single-handed systems, which are limited in their ability to handle larger or more complex objects. In contrast, bimanual catching offers significant potential for improved dexterity and object handling but introduces new challenges in coordination and control. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning dexterous bimanual catching skills using Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL). Our approach introduces an adversarial reward scheme, where a throw agent increases the difficulty of throws-adjusting speed-while a catch agent learns to coordinate both hands to catch objects under these evolving conditions. We evaluate the framework in simulated environments using 15 different objects, demonstrating robustness and versatility in handling diverse objects. Our method achieved approximately a 2x increase in catching reward compared to single-agent baselines across 15 diverse objects.</description>

      <title>Doppler Correspondence: Non-Iterative Scan Matching With Doppler Velocity-Based Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving successful scan matching is essential for LiDAR odometry. However, in challenging environments with adverse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching. Recently, the emergence of frequency-modulated continuous wave 4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies has provided the potential to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper introduces, for the first time, a simple Doppler velocity-based correspondence -- Doppler Correspondence -- that is invariant to translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns.</description>

      <title>Anti-Degeneracy Scheme for Lidar SLAM based on Particle Filter in Geometry Feature-Less Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on particle filtering has been extensively employed in indoor scenarios due to its high efficiency. However, in geometry feature-less scenes, the accuracy is severely reduced due to lack of constraints. In this article, we propose an anti-degeneracy system based on deep learning. Firstly, we design a scale-invariant linear mapping to convert coordinates in continuous space into discrete indexes, in which a data augmentation method based on Gaussian model is proposed to ensure the model performance by effectively mitigating the impact of changes in the number of particles on the feature distribution. Secondly, we develop a degeneracy detection model using residual neural networks (ResNet) and transformer which is able to identify degeneracy by scrutinizing the distribution of the particle population. Thirdly, an adaptive anti-degeneracy strategy is designed, which first performs fusion and perturbation on the resample process to provide rich and accurate initial values for the pose optimization, and use a hierarchical pose optimization combining coarse and fine matching, which is able to adaptively adjust the optimization frequency and the sensor trustworthiness according to the degree of degeneracy, in order to enhance the ability of searching the global optimal pose. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of the model, as well as the improvement of the image matrix method and GPU on the computation time through ablation experiments, and verify the performance of the anti-degeneracy system in different scenarios through simulation experiments and real experiments.

      <title>SurgPose: a Dataset for Articulated Robotic Surgical Tool Pose Estimation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient surgical robotic tool pose estimation is of fundamental significance to downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) in surgical training and learning-based autonomous manipulation. While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and skeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120k surgical instrument instances (80k for training and 40k for validation) of 6 categories. Each instrument instance is labeled with 7 semantic keypoints. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we test a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose.

      <title>Disentangled Iterative Surface Fitting for Contact-stable Grasp Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve Center of Mass (CoM) alignment, and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach through simulations on ten YCB dataset objects, demonstrating an 80% improvement in grasp success over conventional surface fitting methods that disregard contact stability.

      <title>Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</description>

      <title>FUNCTO: Function-Centric One-Shot Imitation Learning for Tool Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning tool use from a single human demonstration video offers a highly intuitive and efficient approach to robot teaching. While humans can effortlessly generalize a demonstrated tool manipulation skill to diverse tools that support the same function (e.g., pouring with a mug versus a teapot), current one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) methods struggle to achieve this. A key challenge lies in establishing functional correspondences between demonstration and test tools, considering significant geometric variations among tools with the same function (i.e., intra-function variations). To address this challenge, we propose FUNCTO (Function-Centric OSIL for Tool Manipulation), an OSIL method that establishes function-centric correspondences with a 3D functional keypoint representation, enabling robots to generalize tool manipulation skills from a single human demonstration video to novel tools with the same function despite significant intra-function variations. With this formulation, we factorize FUNCTO into three stages: (1) functional keypoint extraction, (2) function-centric correspondence establishment, and (3) functional keypoint-based action planning. We evaluate FUNCTO against exiting modular OSIL methods and end-to-end behavioral cloning methods through real-robot experiments on diverse tool manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of FUNCTO when generalizing to novel tools with intra-function geometric variations.

      <title>Early Detection of Human Handover Intentions in Human-Robot Collaboration: Comparing EEG, Gaze, and Hand Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) relies on accurate and timely recognition of human intentions to ensure seamless interactions. Among common HRC tasks, human-to-robot object handovers have been studied extensively for planning the robot's actions during object reception, assuming the human intention for object handover. However, distinguishing handover intentions from other actions has received limited attention. Most research on handovers has focused on visually detecting motion trajectories, which often results in delays or false detections when trajectories overlap. This paper investigates whether human intentions for object handovers are reflected in non-movement-based physiological signals. We conduct a multimodal analysis comparing three data modalities: electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze, and hand-motion signals. Our study aims to distinguish between handover-intended human motions and non-handover motions in an HRC setting, evaluating each modality's performance in predicting and classifying these actions before and after human movement initiation. We develop and evaluate human intention detectors based on these modalities, comparing their accuracy and timing in identifying handover intentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically develop and test intention detectors across multiple modalities within the same experimental context of human-robot handovers. Our analysis reveals that handover intention can be detected from all three modalities. Nevertheless, gaze signals are the earliest as well as the most accurate to classify the motion as intended for handover or non-handover.</description>

      <title>Residual Learning towards High-fidelity Vehicle Dynamics Modeling with Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vehicle dynamics model serves as a vital component of autonomous driving systems, as it describes the temporal changes in vehicle state. In a long period, researchers have made significant endeavors to accurately model vehicle dynamics. Traditional physics-based methods employ mathematical formulae to model vehicle dynamics, but they are unable to adequately describe complex vehicle systems due to the simplifications they entail. Recent advancements in deep learning-based methods have addressed this limitation by directly regressing vehicle dynamics. However, the performance and generalization capabilities still require further enhancement. In this letter, we address these problems by proposing a vehicle dynamics correction system that leverages deep neural networks to correct the state residuals of a physical model instead of directly estimating the states. This system greatly reduces the difficulty of network learning and thus improves the estimation accuracy of vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, we have developed a novel Transformer-based dynamics residual correction network, DyTR. This network implicitly represents state residuals as high-dimensional queries, and iteratively updates the estimated residuals by interacting with dynamics state features. The experiments in simulations demonstrate the proposed system works much better than physics model, and our proposed DyTR model achieves the best performances on dynamics state residual correction task, reducing the state prediction errors of a simple 3 DoF vehicle model by an average of 92.3% and 59.9% in two dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>Stonefish: Supporting Machine Learning Research in Marine Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.</description>

      <title>1 A formal implementation of Behavior Trees to act in robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BT) are becoming quite popular as an Acting component of autonomous robotic systems. We propose to define a formal semantics to BT by translating them to a formal language which enables us to perform verification of programs written with BT, as well as runtime verification while these BT execute. This allows us to formally verify BT correctness without requiring BT programmers to master formal language and without compromising BT most valuable features: modularity, flexibility and reusability. We present the formal framework we use: Fiacre, its langage and the produced TTS model; Tina, its model checking tools and Hippo, its runtime verification engine. We then show how the translation from BT to Fiacre is automatically done, the type of formal LTL and CTL properties we can check offline and how to execute the formal model online in place of a regular BT engine. We illustrate our approach on two robotics applications, and show how BT could benefit of other features available in the Fiacre formal framework (state variables, time, etc).</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Model of the UR10 Robot and its ROS2 Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the full dynamic model of the UR10 industrial robot. A triple-stage identification approach is adopted to estimate the manipulator's dynamic coefficients. First, linear parameters are computed using a standard linear regression algorithm. Subsequently, nonlinear friction parameters are estimated according to a sigmoidal model. Lastly, motor drive gains are devised to map estimated joint currents to torques. The overall identified model can be used for both control and planning purposes, as the accompanied ROS2 software can be easily reconfigured to account for a generic payload. The estimated robot model is experimentally validated against a set of exciting trajectories and compared to the state-of-the-art model for the same manipulator, achieving higher current prediction accuracy (up to a factor of 4.43) and more precise motor gains. The related software is available at https://codeocean.com/capsule/8515919/tree/v2.</description>

      <title>Robotic CBCT Meets Robotic Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-modality imaging system offers optimal fused images for safe and precise interventions in modern clinical practices, such as computed tomography - ultrasound (CT-US) guidance for needle insertion. However, the limited dexterity and mobility of current imaging devices hinder their integration into standardized workflows and the advancement toward fully autonomous intervention systems. In this paper, we present a novel clinical setup where robotic cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and robotic US are pre-calibrated and dynamically co-registered, enabling new clinical applications. This setup allows registration-free rigid registration, facilitating multi-modal guided procedures in the absence of tissue deformation. First, a one-time pre-calibration is performed between the systems. To ensure a safe insertion path by highlighting critical vasculature on the 3D CBCT, SAM2 segments vessels from B-mode images, using the Doppler signal as an autonomously generated prompt. Based on the registration, the Doppler image or segmented vessel masks are then mapped onto the CBCT, creating an optimally fused image with comprehensive detail. To validate the system, we used a specially designed phantom, featuring lesions covered by ribs and multiple vessels with simulated moving flow. The mapping error between US and CBCT resulted in an average deviation of 1.72+-0.62 mm. A user study demonstrated the effectiveness of CBCT-US fusion for needle insertion guidance, showing significant improvements in time efficiency, accuracy, and success rate. Needle intervention performance improved by approximately 50% compared to the conventional US-guided workflow. We present the first robotic dual-modality imaging system designed to guide clinical applications. The results show significant performance improvements compared to traditional manual interventions.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-Adaptive Spatiotemporal Correspondence Identification for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correspondence identification (CoID) is an essential capability in multi-robot collaborative perception, which enables a group of robots to consistently refer to the same objects within their respective fields of view. In real-world applications, such as connected autonomous driving, vehicles face challenges in directly sharing raw observations due to limited communication bandwidth. In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for bandwidth-adaptive spatiotemporal CoID in collaborative perception. This approach allows robots to progressively select partial spatiotemporal observations and share with others, while adapting to communication constraints that dynamically change over time. We evaluate our approach across various scenarios in connected autonomous driving simulations. Experimental results validate that our approach enables CoID and adapts to dynamic communication bandwidth changes. In addition, our approach achieves 8%-56% overall improvements in terms of covisible object retrieval for CoID and data sharing efficiency, which outperforms previous techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>A Monocular Event-Camera Motion Capture System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion capture systems are a widespread tool in research to record ground-truth poses of objects. Commercial systems use reflective markers attached to the object and then triangulate pose of the object from multiple camera views. Consequently, the object must be visible to multiple cameras which makes such multi-view motion capture systems unsuited for deployments in narrow, confined spaces (e.g. ballast tanks of ships). In this technical report we describe a monocular event-camera motion capture system which overcomes this limitation and is ideally suited for narrow spaces. Instead of passive markers it relies on active, blinking LED markers such that each marker can be uniquely identified from the blinking frequency. The markers are placed at known locations on the tracking object. We then solve the PnP (perspective-n-points) problem to obtain the position and orientation of the object. The developed system has millimeter accuracy, millisecond latency and we demonstrate that its state estimate can be used to fly a small, agile quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Learning Getting-Up Policies for Real-World Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic fall recovery is a crucial prerequisite before humanoid robots can be reliably deployed. Hand-designing controllers for getting up is difficult because of the varied configurations a humanoid can end up in after a fall and the challenging terrains humanoid robots are expected to operate on. This paper develops a learning framework to produce controllers that enable humanoid robots to get up from varying configurations on varying terrains. Unlike previous successful applications of humanoid locomotion learning, the getting-up task involves complex contact patterns, which necessitates accurately modeling the collision geometry and sparser rewards. We address these challenges through a two-phase approach that follows a curriculum. The first stage focuses on discovering a good getting-up trajectory under minimal constraints on smoothness or speed / torque limits. The second stage then refines the discovered motions into deployable (i.e. smooth and slow) motions that are robust to variations in initial configuration and terrains. We find these innovations enable a real-world G1 humanoid robot to get up from two main situations that we considered: a) lying face up and b) lying face down, both tested on flat, deformable, slippery surfaces and slopes (e.g., sloppy grass and snowfield). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of learned getting-up policies for human-sized humanoid robots in the real world.

      <title>Real Time Control of Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform Using Concerto Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the CRL2RT algorithm, an advanced reinforcement learning method aimed at improving the real-time control performance of the Direct-Drive Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform (DDTWEP). Inspired by dragonfly flight, DDTWEP's tandem wing structure causes nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic interactions, leading to complex load behaviors during pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers. These complexities challenge stable motion control at high frequencies (2000 Hz). To overcome these issues, we developed the CRL2RT algorithm, which combines classical control elements with reinforcement learning-based controllers using a time-interleaved architecture and a rule-based policy composer. This integration ensures finite-time convergence and single-life adaptability. Experimental results under various conditions, including different flapping frequencies and yaw disturbances, show that CRL2RT achieves a control frequency surpassing 2500 Hz on standard CPUs. Additionally, when integrated with classical controllers like PID, Adaptive PID, and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), CRL2RT enhances tracking performance by 18.3% to 60.7%. These findings demonstrate CRL2RT's broad applicability and superior performance in complex real-time control scenarios, validating its effectiveness in overcoming existing control strategy limitations and advancing robust, efficient real-time control for biomimetic aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based User Scheduling for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stand-alone perception systems in autonomous driving suffer from limited sensing ranges and occlusions at extended distances, potentially resulting in catastrophic outcomes. To address this issue, collaborative perception is envisioned to improve perceptual accuracy by using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to enable collaboration among connected and autonomous vehicles and roadside units. However, due to limited communication resources, it is impractical for all units to transmit sensing data such as point clouds or high-definition video. As a result, it is essential to optimize the scheduling of communication links to ensure efficient spectrum utilization for the exchange of perceptual data. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based V2X user scheduling algorithm for collaborative perception. Given the challenges in acquiring perceptual labels, we reformulate the conventional label-dependent objective into a label-free goal, based on characteristics of 3D object detection. Incorporating both channel state information (CSI) and semantic information, we develop a double deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based user scheduling framework for collaborative perception, named SchedCP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of SchedCP compared with traditional V2X scheduling methods. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate how our proposed algorithm adaptively modifies the scheduling decisions by taking both instantaneous CSI and perceptual semantics into account.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.</description>

Abstract: The use of control barrier functions under uncertain pose information of multiple small servicing agents is analyzed for a satellite servicing application. The application consists of modular servicing agents deployed towards a tumbling space object from a mothership. Relative position and orientation of each agent is obtained via fusion of relative range and inertial measurement sensors. The control barrier functions are utilized to avoid collisions with other agents for the application of simultaneously relocating servicing agents on a tumbling body. A differential collision detection and avoidance framework using the polytopic hull of the tumbling space object is utilized to safely guide the agents away from the tumbling object.</description>

      <title>Learning to be Smooth: An End-to-End Differentiable Particle Smoother</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For challenging state estimation problems arising in domains like vision and robotics, particle-based representations attractively enable temporal reasoning about multiple posterior modes. Particle smoothers offer the potential for more accurate offline data analysis by propagating information both forward and backward in time, but have classically required human-engineered dynamics and observation models. Extending recent advances in discriminative training of particle filters, we develop a framework for low-variance propagation of gradients across long time sequences when training particle smoothers. Our "two-filter'' smoother integrates particle streams that are propagated forward and backward in time, while incorporating stratification and importance weights in the resampling step to provide low-variance gradient estimates for neural network dynamics and observation models. The resulting mixture density particle smoother is substantially more accurate than state-of-the-art particle filters, as well as search-based baselines, for city-scale global vehicle localization from real-world videos and maps.</description>

      <title>Memory, Benchmark &amp; Robots: A Benchmark for Solving Complex Tasks with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base - a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo - a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation. Our contributions establish a unified framework for advancing memory RL research, driving the development of more reliable systems for real-world applications.

      <title>Synthesis of Dynamic Masks for Information-Theoretic Opacity in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synthesis of dynamic information releasing mechanisms, referred to as ''masks'', to minimize information leakage from a stochastic system to an external observer. Specifically, for a stochastic system, an observer aims to infer whether the final state of the system trajectory belongs to a set of secret states. The dynamic mask seeks to regulate sensor information in order to maximize the observer's uncertainty about the final state, a property known as final-state opacity. While existing supervisory control literature on dynamic masks primarily addresses qualitative opacity, we propose quantifying opacity in stochastic systems by conditional entropy, which is a measure of information leakage in information security. We then formulate a constrained optimization problem to synthesize a dynamic mask that maximizes final-state opacity under a total cost constraint on masking. To solve this constrained optimal dynamic mask synthesis problem, we develop a novel primal-dual policy gradient method. Additionally, we present a technique for computing the gradient of conditional entropy with respect to the masking policy parameters, leveraging observable operators in hidden Markov models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our method to an illustrative example and a stochastic grid world scenario, showing how our algorithm optimally enforces final-state opacity under cost constraints.</description>

      <title>HIPPo: Harnessing Image-to-3D Priors for Model-free Zero-shot 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on model-free zero-shot 6D object pose estimation for robotics applications. While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</description>

      <title>USER-VLM 360: Personalized Vision Language Models with User-aware Tuning for Social Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of vision-language models into robotic systems constitutes a significant advancement in enabling machines to interact with their surroundings in a more intuitive manner. While VLMs offer rich multimodal reasoning, existing approaches lack user-specific adaptability, often relying on generic interaction paradigms that fail to account for individual behavioral, contextual, or socio-emotional nuances. When customization is attempted, ethical concerns arise from unmitigated biases in user data, risking exclusion or unfair treatment. To address these dual challenges, we propose User-VLM 360{\deg}, a holistic framework integrating multimodal user modeling with bias-aware optimization. Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that adapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias mitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\deg} socio-emotive interaction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational metadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features understanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation studies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot validates real-time adaptability across diverse users. We open-source parameter-efficient 3B/10B models and an ethical verification framework for responsible adaptation.</description>

      <title>GenComUI: Exploring Generative Visual Aids as Medium to Support Task-Oriented Human-Robot Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the integration of generative visual aids in human-robot task communication. We developed GenComUI, a system powered by large language models that dynamically generates contextual visual aids (such as map annotations, path indicators, and animations) to support verbal task communication and facilitate the generation of customized task programs for the robot. This system was informed by a formative study that examined how humans use external visual tools to assist verbal communication in spatial tasks. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a user experiment (n = 20) comparing GenComUI with a voice-only baseline. The results demonstrate that generative visual aids, through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, enhance verbal task communication by providing continuous visual feedback, thus promoting natural and effective human-robot communication. Additionally, the study offers a set of design implications, emphasizing how dynamically generated visual aids can serve as an effective communication medium in human-robot interaction. These findings underscore the potential of generative visual aids to inform the design of more intuitive and effective human-robot communication, particularly for complex communication scenarios in human-robot interaction and LLM-based end-user development.</description>

      <title>Mobile Robotic Multi-View Photometric Stereo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-View Photometric Stereo (MVPS) is a popular method for fine-detailed 3D acquisition of an object from images. Despite its outstanding results on diverse material objects, a typical MVPS experimental setup requires a well-calibrated light source and a monocular camera installed on an immovable base. This restricts the use of MVPS on a movable platform, limiting us from taking MVPS benefits in 3D acquisition for mobile robotics applications. To this end, we introduce a new mobile robotic system for MVPS. While the proposed system brings advantages, it introduces additional algorithmic challenges. Addressing them, in this paper, we further propose an incremental approach for mobile robotic MVPS. Our approach leverages a supervised learning setup to predict per-view surface normal, object depth, and per-pixel uncertainty in model-predicted results. A refined depth map per view is obtained by solving an MVPS-driven optimization problem proposed in this paper. Later, we fuse the refined depth map while tracking the camera pose w.r.t the reference frame to recover globally consistent object 3D geometry. Experimental results show the advantages of our robotic system and algorithm, featuring the local high-frequency surface detail recovery with globally consistent object shape. Our work is beyond any MVPS system yet presented, providing encouraging results on objects with unknown reflectance properties using fewer frames without a tiring calibration and installation process, enabling computationally efficient robotic automation approach to photogrammetry. The proposed approach is nearly 100 times computationally faster than the state-of-the-art MVPS methods such as [1, 2] while maintaining the similar results when tested on subjects taken from the benchmark DiLiGenT MV dataset [3].</description>

      <title>Can you pass that tool?: Implications of Indirect Speech in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect speech acts (ISAs) are a natural pragmatic feature of human communication, allowing requests to be conveyed implicitly while maintaining subtlety and flexibility. Although advancements in speech recognition have enabled natural language interactions with robots through direct, explicit commands--providing clarity in communication--the rise of large language models presents the potential for robots to interpret ISAs. However, empirical evidence on the effects of ISAs on human-robot collaboration (HRC) remains limited. To address this, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=36), engaging a participant and a robot in collaborative physical tasks. Our findings indicate that robots capable of understanding ISAs significantly improve human's perceived robot anthropomorphism, team performance, and trust. However, the effectiveness of ISAs is task- and context-dependent, thus requiring careful use. These results highlight the importance of appropriately integrating direct and indirect requests in HRC to enhance collaborative experiences and task performance.</description>

      <title>Does Knowledge About Perceptual Uncertainty Help an Agent in Automated Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents in real-world scenarios like automated driving deal with uncertainty in their environment, in particular due to perceptual uncertainty. Although, reinforcement learning is dedicated to autonomous decision-making under uncertainty these algorithms are typically not informed about the uncertainty currently contained in their environment. On the other hand, uncertainty estimation for perception itself is typically directly evaluated in the perception domain, e.g., in terms of false positive detection rates or calibration errors based on camera images. Its use for deciding on goal-oriented actions remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we investigate how an agent's behavior is influenced by an uncertain perception and how this behavior changes if information about this uncertainty is available. Therefore, we consider a proxy task, where the agent is rewarded for driving a route as fast as possible without colliding with other road users. For controlled experiments, we introduce uncertainty in the observation space by perturbing the perception of the given agent while informing the latter. Our experiments show that an unreliable observation space modeled by a perturbed perception leads to a defensive driving behavior of the agent. Furthermore, when adding the information about the current uncertainty directly to the observation space, the agent adapts to the specific situation and in general accomplishes its task faster while, at the same time, accounting for risks.</description>

      <title>VLP: Vision-Language Preference Learning for Embodied Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward engineering is one of the key challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Preference-based RL effectively addresses this issue by learning from human feedback. However, it is both time-consuming and expensive to collect human preference labels. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{P}reference learning framework, named \textbf{VLP}, which learns a vision-language preference model to provide preference feedback for embodied manipulation tasks. To achieve this, we define three types of language-conditioned preferences and construct a vision-language preference dataset, which contains versatile implicit preference orders without human annotations. The preference model learns to extract language-related features, and then serves as a preference annotator in various downstream tasks. The policy can be learned according to the annotated preferences via reward learning or direct policy optimization. Extensive empirical results on simulated embodied manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method provides accurate preferences and generalizes to unseen tasks and unseen language instructions, outperforming the baselines by a large margin.</description>

Abstract: Language-conditioned robot manipulation is an emerging field aimed at enabling seamless communication and cooperation between humans and robotic agents by teaching robots to comprehend and execute instructions conveyed in natural language. This interdisciplinary area integrates scene understanding, language processing, and policy learning to bridge the gap between human instructions and robotic actions. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically explore recent advancements in language-conditioned robotic manipulation. We categorize existing methods into language-conditioned reward shaping, language-conditioned policy learning, neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence, and the utilization of foundational models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we analyze state-of-the-art techniques concerning semantic information extraction, environment and evaluation, auxiliary tasks, and task representation strategies. By conducting a comparative analysis, we highlight the strengths and limitations of current approaches in bridging language instructions with robot actions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions, focusing on potentially enhancing generalization capabilities and addressing safety issues in language-conditioned robot manipulators.</description>

Abstract: The artificial lateral line (ALL), comprising distributed flow sensors, has been successful in sensing motion states of bioinspired underwater robots like robotic fish. However, its application to robots driven by rotating propellers remains unexplored due to the complexity of propeller wake flow. This paper investigates the feasibility of using ALL to sense propeller wake for underwater robot leader-follower formation. To estimate the lateral motion states of a leader propeller, this paper designs a multi-output deep learning network that extracts temporal and spatial features from distributed pressure measurements of propeller wake. Extensive experiments are conducted on a designed testbed, the results of which validate the effectiveness of the proposed propeller wake sensing method.</description>

      <title>Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations with Self-Supervision for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving data utilization, especially for imperfect data from task failures, is crucial for robotic manipulation due to the challenging, time-consuming, and expensive data collection process in the real world. Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential to mimic human motions with high visual fidelity, yet translating these motions into practical, physical execution remains a significant challenge. Existing techniques in the graphics community often prioritize visual fidelity over physics-based feasibility, posing a significant challenge for deploying bipedal systems in practical applications. This paper addresses these issues through bounded residual reinforcement learning to produce physics-based high-quality motion imitation onto legged humanoid robots that enhance motion resemblance while successfully following the reference human trajectory. Our framework, Imitation to Control Humanoid Robots Through Bounded Residual Reinforcement Learning (I-CTRL), reformulates motion imitation as a constrained refinement over non-physics-based retargeted motions. I-CTRL excels in motion imitation with simple and unique rewards that generalize across five robots. Moreover, our framework introduces an automatic priority scheduler to manage large-scale motion datasets when efficiently training a unified RL policy across diverse motions. The proposed approach signifies a crucial step forward in advancing the control of bipedal robots, emphasizing the importance of aligning visual and physical realism for successful motion imitation.</description>

      <title>A Master-Follower Teleoperation System for Robotic Catheterization: Design, Characterization, and Tracking Control</title>

Abstract: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>AirSLAM: An Efficient and Illumination-Robust Point-Line Visual SLAM System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient visual SLAM system designed to tackle both short-term and long-term illumination challenges. Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map. To enhance the applicability of the proposed system to real-world robots, we deploy and accelerate the feature detection and matching networks using C++ and NVIDIA TensorRT. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems in illumination-challenging environments. Efficiency evaluations show that our system can run at a rate of 73Hz on a PC and 40Hz on an embedded platform. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/sair-lab/AirSLAM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-Time Generation of Delay-Compensated Video Feeds for Outdoor Mobile Robot Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleoperation is an important technology to enable supervisors to control agricultural robots remotely. However, environmental factors in dense crop rows and limitations in network infrastructure hinder the reliability of data streamed to teleoperators. These issues result in delayed and variable frame rate video feeds that often deviate significantly from the robot's actual viewpoint. We propose a modular learning-based vision pipeline to generate delay-compensated images in real-time for supervisors. Our extensive offline evaluations demonstrate that our method generates more accurate images compared to state-of-the-art approaches in our setting. Additionally, ours is one of the few works to evaluate a delay-compensation method in outdoor field environments with complex terrain on data from a real robot in real-time. Resulting videos and code are provided at https://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/comp-teleop.</description>

      <title>VertiSelector: Automatic Curriculum Learning for Wheeled Mobility on Vertically Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable extreme off-road mobility by circumventing complex kinodynamic modeling, planning, and control by simulated end-to-end trial-and-error learning experiences. However, most RL methods are sample-inefficient when training in a large amount of manually designed simulation environments and struggle at generalizing to the real world. To address these issues, we introduce VertiSelector (VS), an automatic curriculum learning framework designed to enhance learning efficiency and generalization by selectively sampling training terrain. VS prioritizes vertically challenging terrain with higher Temporal Difference (TD) errors when revisited, thereby allowing robots to learn at the edge of their evolving capabilities. By dynamically adjusting the sampling focus, VS significantly boosts sample efficiency and generalization within the VW-Chrono simulator built on the Chrono multi-physics engine. Furthermore, we provide simulation and physical results using VS on a Verti-4-Wheeler platform. These results demonstrate that VS can achieve 23.08% improvement in terms of success rate by efficiently sampling during training and robustly generalizing to the real world.</description>

      <title>Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose \textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5\%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Sensor Placement: A Large-Scale Computational Study and Novel Hybrid Accelerated-Refinement Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the omnidirectional sensor-placement problem (OSPP), which involves placing static sensors in a continuous 2D environment to achieve a user-defined coverage requirement while minimizing sensor count. The problem is motivated by applications in mobile robotics, particularly for optimizing visibility-based route planning tasks such as environment inspection, target search, and region patrolling. We focus on omnidirectional visibility models, which eliminate sensor orientation constraints while remaining relevant to real-world sensing technologies like LiDAR, 360-degree cameras, and multi-sensor arrays. Three key models are considered: unlimited visibility, limited-range visibility to reflect physical or application-specific constraints, and localization-uncertainty visibility to account for sensor placement uncertainty in robotics. Our first contribution is a large-scale computational study comparing classical convex-partitioning and sampling-based heuristics for the OSPP, analyzing their trade-off between runtime efficiency and solution quality. Our second contribution is a new class of hybrid accelerated-refinement (HAR) heuristics, which combine and refine outputs from multiple sensor-placement methods while incorporating preprocessing techniques to accelerate refinement. Results demonstrate that HAR heuristics significantly outperform traditional methods, achieving the lowest sensor counts and improving the runtime of sampling-based approaches. Additionally, we adapt a specific HAR heuristic to the localization-uncertainty visibility model, showing that it achieves the required coverage for small to moderate localization uncertainty. Future work may apply HAR to visibility-based route planning tasks or explore novel sensor-placement approaches to achieve formal coverage guarantees under uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: With the broader usage and highly successful development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a growth of interest and demand for applying LLMs to autonomous driving technology. Driven by their natural language understanding and reasoning ability, LLMs have the potential to enhance various aspects of autonomous driving systems, from perception and scene understanding to language interaction and decision-making. In this paper, we first introduce the novel concept of designing LLMs for autonomous driving (LLM4AD). Then, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following abilities of LLM4AD in simulation. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments on real-world vehicle platforms, thoroughly evaluating the performance and potential of our LLM4AD systems. Finally, we envision the main challenges of LLM4AD, including latency, deployment, security and privacy, safety, trust and transparency, and personalization. Our research highlights the significant potential of LLMs to enhance various aspects of autonomous vehicle technology, from perception and scene understanding to language interaction and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>EMOS: Embodiment-aware Heterogeneous Multi-robot Operating System with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems (HMRS) have emerged as a powerful approach for tackling complex tasks that single robots cannot manage alone. Current large-language-model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-based MAS) have shown success in areas like software development and operating systems, but applying these systems to robot control presents unique challenges. In particular, the capabilities of each agent in a multi-robot system are inherently tied to the physical composition of the robots, rather than predefined roles. To address this issue, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to enable effective collaboration among heterogeneous robots with varying embodiments and capabilities, along with a new benchmark named Habitat-MAS. One of our key designs is $\textit{Robot Resume}$: Instead of adopting human-designed role play, we propose a self-prompted approach, where agents comprehend robot URDF files and call robot kinematics tools to generate descriptions of their physics capabilities to guide their behavior in task planning and action execution. The Habitat-MAS benchmark is designed to assess how a multi-agent framework handles tasks that require embodiment-aware reasoning, which includes 1) manipulation, 2) perception, 3) navigation, and 4) comprehensive multi-floor object rearrangement. The experimental results indicate that the robot's resume and the hierarchical design of our multi-agent system are essential for the effective operation of the heterogeneous multi-robot system within this intricate problem context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human walkers traverse diverse environments and demonstrate different gait locomotion and energy cost on granular terrains compared to solid ground. We present a stiffness-based model predictive control approach of knee exoskeleton assistance on sand. The gait and locomotion comparison is first discussed for human walkers on sand and solid ground. A machine learning-based estimation scheme is then presented to predict the ground reaction forces (GRFs) for human walkers on different terrains in real time. Built on the estimated GRFs and human joint torques, a knee exoskeleton controller is designed to provide assistive torque through a model predictive stiffness control scheme. We conduct indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the modeling and control design and their performance. The experiments demonstrate the major muscle activation and metabolic reductions by respectively 15% and 3.7% under the assistive exoskeleton control of human walking on sand.</description>

      <title>Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy Learning for Generalizable Contact-Rich Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact-rich bimanual manipulation involves precise coordination of two arms to change object states through strategically selected contacts and motions. Due to the inherent complexity of these tasks, acquiring sufficient demonstration data and training policies that generalize to unseen scenarios remain a largely unresolved challenge. Building on recent advances in planning through contacts, we introduce Generalizable Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy Learning (GLIDE), an approach that effectively learns to solve contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks by leveraging model-based motion planners to generate demonstration data in high-fidelity physics simulation. Through efficient planning in randomized environments, our approach generates large-scale and high-quality synthetic motion trajectories for tasks involving diverse objects and transformations. We then train a task-conditioned diffusion policy via behavior cloning using these demonstrations. To tackle the sim-to-real gap, we propose a set of essential design options in feature extraction, task representation, action prediction, and data augmentation that enable learning robust prediction of smooth action sequences and generalization to unseen scenarios. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that our approach can enable a bimanual robotic system to effectively manipulate objects of diverse geometries, dimensions, and physical properties.

      <title>NaVILA: Legged Robot Vision-Language-Action Model for Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show more results at https://navila-bot.github.io/</description>

      <title>FLIP: Flow-Centric Generative Planning as General-Purpose Manipulation World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to develop a model-based planning framework for world models that can be scaled with increasing model and data budgets for general-purpose manipulation tasks with only language and vision inputs. To this end, we present FLow-centric generative Planning (FLIP), a model-based planning algorithm on visual space that features three key modules: 1. a multi-modal flow generation model as the general-purpose action proposal module; 2. a flow-conditioned video generation model as the dynamics module; and 3. a vision-language representation learning model as the value module. Given an initial image and language instruction as the goal, FLIP can progressively search for long-horizon flow and video plans that maximize the discounted return to accomplish the task. FLIP is able to synthesize long-horizon plans across objects, robots, and tasks with image flows as the general action representation, and the dense flow information also provides rich guidance for long-horizon video generation. In addition, the synthesized flow and video plans can guide the training of low-level control policies for robot execution. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FLIP can improve both the success rates and quality of long-horizon video plan synthesis and has the interactive world model property, opening up wider applications for future works.Video demos are on our website: https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/flipweb/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current mobile manipulators and high-fidelity simulators lack the ability to seamlessly operate and simulate across integrated environments spanning sea, air, and land. To address this gap, we introduce Aerial-Aquatic Manipulators (AAMs) in SEa, Air, and Land Simulator (SEALS), a comprehensive and photorealistic simulator designed for AAMs to operate and learn in these diverse environments. The development of AAM-SEALS tackles several significant challenges, including the creation of integrated controllers for flying, swimming, and manipulation, and the high-fidelity simulation of aerial dynamics and hydrodynamics leveraging particle-based hydrodynamics. Our evaluation demonstrates smooth operation and photorealistic transitions across air, water, and their interfaces. We quantitatively validate the fidelity of particle-based hydrodynamics by comparing position-tracking errors across real-world and simulated systems. AAM-SEALS benefits a broad range of robotics communities, including robot learning, aerial robotics, underwater robotics, mobile manipulation, and robotic simulators. We will open-source our code and data to foster the advancement of research in these fields. The overview video is available at https://youtu.be/MbqIIrYvR78.

Abstract: This paper presents AI Guide Dog (AIGD), a lightweight egocentric (first-person) navigation system for visually impaired users, designed for real-time deployment on smartphones. AIGD employs a vision-only multi-label classification approach to predict directional commands, ensuring safe navigation across diverse environments. We introduce a novel technique for goal-based outdoor navigation by integrating GPS signals and high-level directions, while also handling uncertain multi-path predictions for destination-free indoor navigation.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. In particular, world models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: 1) Generation of Future Physical World, covering image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; 2) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; 3) Interaction Between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, long-tail scenario generation, and multimodal fusion to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, our comprehensive analysis provides a theoretical framework and technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Latent Representations in Behavior Cloning: An Information Bottleneck Approach for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

      <title>IRIS: An Immersive Robot Interaction System</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces IRIS, an immersive Robot Interaction System leveraging Extended Reality (XR), designed for robot data collection and interaction across multiple simulators, benchmarks, and real-world scenarios. While existing XR-based data collection systems provide efficient and intuitive solutions for large-scale data collection, they are often challenging to reproduce and reuse. This limitation arises because current systems are highly tailored to simulator-specific use cases and environments. IRIS is a novel, easily extendable framework that already supports multiple simulators, benchmarks, and even headsets. Furthermore, IRIS is able to include additional information from real-world sensors, such as point clouds captured through depth cameras. A unified scene specification is generated directly from simulators or real-world sensors and transmitted to XR headsets, creating identical scenes in XR. This specification allows IRIS to support any of the objects, assets, and robots provided by the simulators. In addition, IRIS introduces shared spatial anchors and a robust communication protocol that links simulations between multiple XR headsets. This feature enables multiple XR headsets to share a synchronized scene, facilitating collaborative and multi-user data collection. IRIS can be deployed on any device that supports the Unity Framework, encompassing the vast majority of commercially available headsets. In this work, IRIS was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 3 and the HoloLens 2. IRIS showcased its versatility across a wide range of real-world and simulated scenarios, using current popular robot simulators such as MuJoCo, IsaacSim, CoppeliaSim, and Genesis. In addition, a user study evaluates IRIS on a data collection task for the LIBERO benchmark. The study shows that IRIS significantly outperforms the baseline in both objective and subjective metrics.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

      <title>Continual Adaptation for Autonomous Driving with the Mixture of Progressive Experts Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving requires continuous integration of diverse knowledge in complex traffic , yet existing methods exhibit significant limitations in adaptive capabilities. Addressing this gap demands autonomous driving systems that enable continual adaptation through dynamic adjustments to evolving environmental interactions. This underscores the necessity for enhanced continual learning capabilities to improve system adaptability. To address these challenges, the paper introduces a dynamic progressive optimization framework that facilitates adaptation to variations in dynamic environments, achieved by integrating reinforcement learning and supervised learning for data aggregation. Building on this framework, we propose the Mixture of Progressive Experts (MoPE) network. The proposed method selectively activates multiple expert models based on the distinct characteristics of each task and progressively refines the network architecture to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. Simulation results show that the MoPE model outperforms behavior cloning methods, achieving up to a 7.8% performance improvement in intricate urban road environments.</description>

      <title>Re$^3$Sim: Generating High-Fidelity Simulation Data via 3D-Photorealistic Real-to-Sim for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world data collection for robotics is costly and resource-intensive, requiring skilled operators and expensive hardware. Simulations offer a scalable alternative but often fail to achieve sim-to-real generalization due to geometric and visual gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D-photorealistic real-to-sim system, namely, RE$^3$SIM, addressing geometric and visual sim-to-real gaps. RE$^3$SIM employs advanced 3D reconstruction and neural rendering techniques to faithfully recreate real-world scenarios, enabling real-time rendering of simulated cross-view cameras within a physics-based simulator. By utilizing privileged information to collect expert demonstrations efficiently in simulation, and train robot policies with imitation learning, we validate the effectiveness of the real-to-sim-to-real pipeline across various manipulation task scenarios. Notably, with only simulated data, we can achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with an average success rate exceeding 58%. To push the limit of real-to-sim, we further generate a large-scale simulation dataset, demonstrating how a robust policy can be built from simulation data that generalizes across various objects. Codes and demos are available at: http://xshenhan.github.io/Re3Sim/.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Learning for Bilevel Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A robot that learns from demonstrations should not just imitate what it sees -- it should understand the high-level concepts that are being demonstrated and generalize them to new tasks. Bilevel planning is a hierarchical model-based approach where predicates (relational state abstractions) can be leveraged to achieve compositional generalization. However, previous bilevel planning approaches depend on predicates that are either hand-engineered or restricted to very simple forms, limiting their scalability to sophisticated, high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we present IVNTR, the first bilevel planning approach capable of learning neural predicates directly from demonstrations. Our key innovation is a neuro-symbolic bilevel learning framework that mirrors the structure of bilevel planning. In IVNTR, symbolic learning of the predicate "effects" and neural learning of the predicate "functions" alternate, with each providing guidance for the other. We evaluate IVNTR in six diverse robot planning domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in abstracting various continuous and high-dimensional states. While most existing approaches struggle to generalize (with &lt;35% success rate), our IVNTR achieves an average of 77% success rate on unseen tasks. Additionally, we showcase IVNTR on a mobile manipulator, where it learns to perform real-world mobile manipulation tasks and generalizes to unseen test scenarios that feature new objects, new states, and longer task horizons. Our findings underscore the promise of learning and planning with abstractions as a path towards high-level generalization.</description>

      <title>S$^2$-Diffusion: Generalizing from Instance-level to Category-level Skills in Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in skill learning has propelled robot manipulation to new heights by enabling it to learn complex manipulation tasks from a practical number of demonstrations. However, these skills are often limited to the particular action, object, and environment \textit{instances} that are shown in the training data, and have trouble transferring to other instances of the same category. In this work we present an open-vocabulary Spatial-Semantic Diffusion policy (S$^2$-Diffusion) which enables generalization from instance-level training data to category-level, enabling skills to be transferable between instances of the same category. We show that functional aspects of skills can be captured via a promptable semantic module combined with a spatial representation. We further propose leveraging depth estimation networks to allow the use of only a single RGB camera. Our approach is evaluated and compared on a diverse number of robot manipulation tasks, both in simulation and in the real world. Our results show that S$^2$-Diffusion is invariant to changes in category-irrelevant factors as well as enables satisfying performance on other instances within the same category, even if it was not trained on that specific instance. Full videos of all real-world experiments are available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Participant Perceptions of a Robotic Coach Conducting Positive Psychology Exercises: A Qualitative Analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a qualitative analysis of participants' perceptions of a robotic coach conducting Positive Psychology exercises, providing insights for the future design of robotic coaches. Participants (n = 20) took part in a single-session (avg. 31 +- 10 minutes) Human-Robot Interaction study in a laboratory setting. We created the design of the robotic coach, and its affective adaptation, based on user-centred design research and collaboration with a professional coach. We transcribed post-study participant interviews and conducted a Thematic Analysis. We discuss the results of that analysis, presenting aspects participants found particularly helpful (e.g., the robot asked the correct questions and helped them think of new positive things in their life), and what should be improved (e.g., the robot's utterance content should be more responsive). We found that participants had no clear preference for affective adaptation or no affective adaptation, which may be due to both positive and negative user perceptions being heightened in the case of adaptation. Based on our qualitative analysis, we highlight insights for the future design of robotic coaches, and areas for future investigation (e.g., examining how participants with different personality traits, or participants experiencing isolation, could benefit from an interaction with a robotic coach).</description>

      <title>High-quality Unknown Object Instance Segmentation via Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient segmentation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is essential for robotic manipulation. Unknown Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), which aims to identify all objects in unknown categories and backgrounds, has become a key capability for various robotic tasks. However, existing methods struggle with over-segmentation and under-segmentation, leading to failures in manipulation tasks such as grasping. To address these challenges, we propose QuBER (Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement), a novel error-informed refinement approach for high-quality UOIS. QuBER first estimates quadruple boundary errors-true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels-at the instance boundaries of the initial segmentation. It then refines the segmentation using an error-guided fusion mechanism, effectively correcting both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that QuBER outperforms state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves various UOIS methods while maintaining a fast inference time of less than 0.1 seconds. Furthermore, we show that QuBER improves the success rate of grasping target objects in cluttered environments.

      <title>CMRNext: Camera to LiDAR Matching in the Wild for Localization and Extrinsic Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDARs are widely used for mapping and localization in dynamic environments. However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available at http://cmrnext.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study of Child Wellbeing Assessment via Online Interactions with a Social Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Socially Assistive Robots are studied in different Child-Robot Interaction settings. However, logistical constraints limit accessibility, particularly affecting timely support for mental wellbeing. In this work, we have investigated whether online interactions with a robot can be used for the assessment of mental wellbeing in children. The children (N=40, 20 girls and 20 boys; 8-13 years) interacted with the Nao robot (30-45 mins) over three sessions, at least a week apart. Audio-visual recordings were collected throughout the sessions that concluded with the children answering user perception questionnaires pertaining to their anxiety towards the robot, and the robot's abilities. We divided the participants into three wellbeing clusters (low, med and high tertiles) using their responses to the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and further analysed how their wellbeing and their perceptions of the robot changed over the wellbeing tertiles, across sessions and across participants' gender. Our primary findings suggest that (I) online mediated-interactions with robots can be effective in assessing children's mental wellbeing over time, and (II) children's overall perception of the robot either improved or remained consistent across time. Supplementary exploratory analyses have also revealed that the gender of the children affected their wellbeing assessments with interactions effectively distinguishing between varying levels of wellbeing for both boys and girls for the first session and only for boys during the second session. The analyses have also revealed that girls have a higher opinion of the robot as a confidante as compared with boys. Findings from this work affirm the potential of using online mediated interactions with robots for the assessment of the mental wellbeing of children.</description>

      <title>3D Whole-body Grasp Synthesis with Directional Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing 3D whole bodies that realistically grasp objects is useful for animation, mixed reality, and robotics. This is challenging, because the hands and body need to look natural w.r.t. each other, the grasped object, as well as the local scene (i.e., a receptacle supporting the object). Moreover, training data for this task is really scarce, while capturing new data is expensive. Recent work goes beyond finite datasets via a divide-and-conquer approach; it first generates a "guiding" right-hand grasp, and then searches for bodies that match this. However, the guiding-hand synthesis lacks controllability and receptacle awareness, so it likely has an implausible direction (i.e., a body can't match this without penetrating the receptacle) and needs corrections through major post-processing. Moreover, the body search needs exhaustive sampling and is expensive. These are strong limitations. We tackle these with a novel method called CWGrasp. Our key idea is that performing geometry-based reasoning "early on," instead of "too late," provides rich "control" signals for inference. To this end, CWGrasp first samples a plausible reaching-direction vector (used later for both the arm and hand) from a probabilistic model built via ray-casting from the object and collision checking. Moreover, CWGrasp uniquely tackles both right and left-hand grasps. We evaluate on the GRAB and ReplicaGrasp datasets. CWGrasp outperforms baselines, at lower runtime and budget, while all components help performance. Code and models are available at https://gpaschalidis.github.io/cwgrasp.</description>

      <title>OccRWKV: Rethinking Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction with Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction networks have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reconstructing the geometric and semantic structure of 3D scenes, providing crucial information for robot navigation and autonomous driving systems. However, due to their large overhead from dense network structure designs, existing networks face challenges balancing accuracy and latency. In this paper, we introduce OccRWKV, an efficient semantic occupancy network inspired by Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV). OccRWKV separates semantics, occupancy prediction, and feature fusion into distinct branches, each incorporating Sem-RWKV and Geo-RWKV blocks. These blocks are designed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the network to learn domain-specific representation (i.e., semantics and geometry), which enhances prediction accuracy. Leveraging the sparse nature of real-world 3D occupancy, we reduce computational overhead by projecting features into the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and propose a BEV-RWKV block for efficient feature enhancement and fusion. This enables real-time inference at 22.2 FPS without compromising performance. Experiments demonstrate that OccRWKV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving a mIoU of 25.1 while being 20 times faster than the best baseline, Co-Occ, making it suitable for real-time deployment on robots to enhance autonomous navigation efficiency. Code and video are available on our project page: https://jmwang0117.github.io/OccRWKV/.</description>

      <title>OpenEMMA: Open-Source Multimodal Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made a significant impact across a wide range of real-world applications, particularly in Autonomous Driving (AD). Their ability to process complex visual data and reason about intricate driving scenarios has paved the way for a new paradigm in end-to-end AD systems. However, the progress of developing end-to-end models for AD has been slow, as existing fine-tuning methods demand substantial resources, including extensive computational power, large-scale datasets, and significant funding. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in inference computing, we propose OpenEMMA, an open-source end-to-end framework based on MLLMs. By incorporating the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, OpenEMMA achieves significant improvements compared to the baseline when leveraging a diverse range of MLLMs. Furthermore, OpenEMMA demonstrates effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness across a variety of challenging driving scenarios, offering a more efficient and effective approach to autonomous driving. We release all the codes in https://github.com/taco-group/OpenEMMA.</description>

      <title>EC-Diffuser: Multi-Object Manipulation via Entity-Centric Behavior Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to manipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant challenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to the combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired behaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to train models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through scaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen object configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that leverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with diffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image data. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric representation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that computes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object dynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models to capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial performance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables compositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including larger numbers of objects than seen during training. We provide video rollouts on our webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/ec-diffuser.</description>

      <title>Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.</description>

      <title>The Induced Matching Distance: A Novel Topological Metric with Applications in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the induced matching distance, a novel topological metric designed to compare discrete structures represented by a symmetric non-negative function. We apply this notion to analyze agent trajectories over time. We use dynamic time warping to measure trajectory similarity and compute the 0-dimensional persistent homology to identify relevant connected components, which, in our context, correspond to groups of similar trajectories. To track the evolution of these components across time, we compute induced matching distances, which preserve the coherence of their dynamic behavior. We then obtain a 1-dimensional signal that quantifies the consistency of trajectory groups over time. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively differentiates between various agent behaviors, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for topological analysis in robotics and related fields.</description>
