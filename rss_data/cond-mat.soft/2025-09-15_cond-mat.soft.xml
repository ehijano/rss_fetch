      <title>Inverse design of drying-induced assembly of multicomponent colloidal-particle films using surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of films assembled by drying colloidal-particle suspensions depend sensitively on both the particles and the processing conditions, making them challenging to engineer. In this work, we develop and test an inverse-design strategy based on surrogate modeling to identify conditions that yield a target film structure. We consider a two-component hard-sphere colloidal suspension whose designable parameters are the particle sizes, the initial composition of particles, and the drying rate. Film drying is simulated approximately using Brownian dynamics. Surrogate models based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Chebyshev polynomial interpolation are trained on a loss function, computed from the simulated film structures, that guides the design process. We find the surrogate models to be effective for both approximation and optimization using only a small number of samples of the loss function. The GPR models are typically slightly more accurate than polynomial interpolants trained using comparable amounts of data, but the polynomial interpolants are more computationally convenient. This work has important implications not only for designing colloidal materials but also more broadly as a strategy for engineering nonequilibrium assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Fine Particle Percolation Dynamics in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influences of restitution coefficient, $e_n$, inter-particle friction, $\mu$, and size ratio, $R$, on gravity-driven percolation of fine particles through static beds of larger particles in the free-sifting regime ($R \gtrsim 6.5$) remain largely unexplored. Here we use discrete element method simulations to study the fine particle percolation velocity, $v_p$, and velocity fluctuations, $v_{rms}$, for $7 \le R \le 50$ and a range of $e_n$ and $\mu$. Increasing $e_n$ increases velocity fluctuations and reduces percolation velocity. Increasing $\mu$ decreases $v_{rms}$ but its influence on $v_p$ varies with $v_{rms}$, decreasing $v_p$ for low $v_{rms}$ and increasing $v_p$ for high $v_{rms}$. Although the influence of size ratio is weaker, larger values of $R$ increase both $v_p$ and $v_{rms}$. We also assess the influence of different excitation mechanisms, specifically using static, randomly excited, and sheared beds, finding that an inverse correlation between $v_p$ and $v_{rms}$ persists across all cases and is well-described by the Drude model, where increased scattering reduces mobility, when $v_{rms}$ is large. However, for weakly excited particles with low $v_{rms}$, the Drude analogy breaks down. In this regime, we introduce a staircase-inspired model that accounts for the gravitationally dominated percolation behavior. These findings provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms governing percolation dynamics in porous media and granular systems.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Closure for Polymer Integral Equation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory, a descendent of Ornstein-Zernike liquid state theory, is a powerful tool to predict the structure and thermodynamics of equilibrium polymer systems, but its accuracy and applicability can be limited in some important cases. Typically, these shortcomings are traced to the analytical closure relationships used to solve the integral equations. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based closure relation trained on a dataset of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymer melts and solutions. PRISM theory with the ML closure outperforms traditional atomic closures (e.g., Percus-Yevick) in predicting the structure of typical coarse-grained model systems. We also use the ML closure to accurately model the results of small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This ML-enhanced PRISM theory can therefore enable rapid soft materials discovery and design efforts.</description>

      <title>Entropic active particle transport in pulsating 3D geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in three-dimensional (3D) oscillatory geometries, which are spatially periodic. We establish a generalized Fick-Jacobs approach, which reduces a 3D system to an effective 1D system based on the assumption that a fast equilibration of particles along the transversal directions of the geometry. The transport characteristics of ABPs are computed semi-analytically and corroborated by numerical simulations. At the optimal frequency of the geometry oscillation, particles exhibit higher average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ and effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$, resembling the phenomena of stochastic resonance. This effect is further enhanced by the self-propelled velocity of ABPs and the amplitude of geometry oscillations. These findings have significant implications for the development of micro- and nanofluidic devices with enhanced control over particle transport and precise manipulation of small-scale biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Viscous flow in glass-forming liquids: The twice-activation analysis and the bond wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twice-activation method for analysis of experimental viscosity-temperature data reveals a set of interconnected parameters describing the state of the flowing glass-forming liquid in terms of convergation point which describes an infinite set of viscosity-temperature relations for the liquid considered. The observed uncertainty in the viscosity-temperature behavior permits to consider glass-forming liquid as the self-organizing system realizing by the bonds wave as dissipative pattern. The acoustic bond wave and the switching bond wave are considered generally and in different groups of glass-formers: inorganic, organic and polymers. The demonstrated correlation between two coordinates of convergation point and kinetic and thermodynamic measures of fragility permits to resolve the problem of the measures discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal constitutive laws for oriented active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overdamped continuum description of oriented active solids in which interactions respect the symmetries of space but do not obey the principle of action and reaction. Taking position and orientation as kinematic variables, we examine the conservation of the linear and angular momentum variables in an elementary volume. We find that nonreciprocal interactions yield, in addition to the areal stresses and moment stresses of classical elasticity, volumetric forces and torques that act as local sources of momentum and angular momentum. Since, by symmetry, these can only depend on the strains, nonreciprocity requires the extension of constitutive modeling to strain-dependent volumetric forces and torques. Using Cartan's method of moving frames and Curie's principle, we derive the materially linear constitutive law that underpins the nonreciprocal, geometrically nonlinear elasticity of the continuum. We study this constitutive law exhaustively for a one-dimensional active solid and identify striking nonreciprocal effects - traveling waves, linear instabilities, spontaneous motion of and about the center of mass - that are absent in a passive, reciprocally interacting solid. Numerical simulations of a particulate active solid model, consisting of a linear assembly of hydrodynamically interacting active particles, yields long-wavelength behavior that is in excellent agreement with theory. Our study provides the foundation for a principled macroscopic mechanics of oriented active solids with symmetry-invariant, nonreciprocal microscopic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Fluids for Nonlinear Photonics: Evaluation of Temperature Dependence of Second-Order Susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic fluids are promising materials for tunable nonlinear photonics, with applications ranging from second harmonic generation to sources of entangled photons. However, the few reported values of second-order susceptibilities vary widely depending on the molecular architecture. Here, we systematically measure second-order NLO susceptibilities of five different materials that exhibit the ferroelectric nematic phase, as well as the more recently discovered layered smectic A ferroelectric phase. The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids.</description>

      <title>Predicting Structural Relaxation in Supercooled Small Molecules via Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Microscopic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Calibrating a Finite-strain Phase-field Model of Fracture for Bonded Granular Materials with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.</description>

      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>

      <title>Sinusoidal Displacement Describes Disorder in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder is an intrinsic feature of all solids, from crystals of atoms to superlattices of colloidal nanoparticles. Unlike atomic crystals, in nanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions of neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive form of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in diffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates throughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation of disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using synchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by preparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of oleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns showed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction characteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial directions and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the superlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle diffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer diffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections. To rationalize these anisotropies in structural coherence and their dependence on superlattice softness, we propose a sinusoidal displacement model where longitudinal and transverse displacements modulate nanocrystal positions. The model explains experimental observations and advances the understanding of disorder in mesocrystalline systems as they approach the limits of structural perfection.</description>

      <title>Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</description>

      <title>Resetting Induces Memory Loss in Non-Markovian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a powerful strategy known to accelerate the first-passage time statistics of stochastic processes. While its effects on Markovian systems are well understood, a general framework for non-Markovian dynamics is still lacking, mostly due to its mathematical complexity. Here, we present an analytical and numerical framework to study non-Markovian processes under resetting, focusing on the first-passage properties of escape kinetics from metastable states. We show that resetting disrupts the inherent time correlation, inducing Markovianity, thereby leading to an efficient escape mechanism. This work, therefore, provides a much needed theoretical approach for incorporating resetting into complex chemical and biological processes, which follow non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging reveals electromechanical ionic memory in 2D nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofluidic memristors promise brain-inspired information processing with ions, yet their microscopic origin remains debated. So far, ionic memory has been attributed to ion-specific interactions, dynamic wetting, chemical reactions or mechanical deformations, yet typically without direct evidence. Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional, driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves.</description>

      <title>Granular rheology: a tale of three time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.05931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt statistical models of the physics of complex fluids to study the rheology of granular liquids. This allows us to provide laws of granular rheology based on first principles, which compare well with previously established phenomenological laws. In particular, the very successful law of mu(I) rheology can be understood within our model as the lowest order non trivial Pade approximant of the macroscopic laws of rheology. Our model's ability to describe granular physics outside of the Bagnold scaling regime allows for a natural extension to the rheology of granular suspensions.</description>

      <title>Ion Selectivity in Uncharged Tapered Nanoslits through Heterogeneous Water Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ion and water transport driven by an electric field through quasi-two-dimensional nanoslits with a tapered geometry. Despite the absence of surface charge on the channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe a robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. Additionally, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. However, in uncharged tapered nanoslits, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</description>

      <title>DNA Unzipping Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic driving enables independent control of material bits for targeted memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials with bistable elements can store vast amounts of information, but writing these memories requires impractical local control or lengthy multi-cycle protocols. We overcome this limitation with a dynamic control strategy that accesses any configuration in a single global drive cycle by leveraging the system's sensitivity to the drive and its time derivatives. We realize this strategy with bistable beams on a rotating platform, where drive cycles become orbits in a control space of angular velocity and acceleration. State changes occur when these orbits cross switching thresholds, which we rationally design so that each state can be accessed by a single drive orbit. We construct a five-bit system and demonstrate its full addressability by selecting drive orbits that write all 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet in ASCII representation. This dynamic control paradigm offers a general route towards smart, remotely operated devices across various physical domains.</description>
