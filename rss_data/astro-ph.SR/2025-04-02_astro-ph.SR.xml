Abstract: Stellar Magnetism affects all spectral types and exists and varies throughout the evolution of stars. Magnetic fields can affect not only the interior of stars, but also their circumstellar environments. In this chapter, we concentrate on the magnetic fields that can be measured at the surface of stars through the influence of the Zeeman effect on their spectra. We provide a brief introduction to the Zeeman effect and its associated light polarization. We discuss the state-of-the-art spectropolarimetric techniques that are used to detect, measure, and characterize surface stellar magnetic fields. We then present one of the most outstanding problem in stellar physics, mainly the origins of magnetic fields in massive OBA stars. We describe our current knowledge of the properties of known magnetic massive stars, such as their incidence, field distribution, topology, etc., and offer an outlook on the impact of stellar evolution on stellar magnetism.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning method for variable star classification using the TESS Sectors 1-57 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a wide-field all-sky survey mission designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets. After over four years photometric surveys, data from sectors 1-57, including approximately 1,050,000 light curves with a 2-minute cadence, were collected. By cross-matching the data with Gaia's variable star catalogue, we obtained labeled datasets for further analysis. Using a random forest classifier, we performed classification of variable stars and designed distinct classification processes for each subclass, 6770 EA, 2971 EW, 980 CEP, 8347 DSCT, 457 RRab, 404 RRc and 12348 ROT were identified. Each variable star was visually inspected to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the compiled catalog. Subsequently, we ultimately obtained 6046 EA, 3859 EW, 2058 CEP, 8434 DSCT, 482 RRab, 416 RRc, and 9694 ROT, and a total of 14092 new variable stars were discovered.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Modeling of Eclipsing Binary Systems with Delta Scuti Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astroseismology in eclipsing binaries with Delta ($\delta$) Scuti components offers a powerful means to derive stellar parameters and probe internal structures. To enable accurate frequency analysis, binary characteristics must be disentangled from the observed light curves. This study utilizes the LC2015 light curve modeling method, followed by the DC2015 differential correction process, integrated into the Wilson-Devinney (WD) eclipsing binary modeling code. The analysis focuses on two $\delta$ Scuti binary systems, KIC 8504570 and SX DRACONIS (Dra), using Kepler and TESS photometric data, supplemented by literature-derived initial stellar parameters. The DC2015 process employs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the difference between observed and modeled light curves. The refined models provide highly accurate stellar parameters, including primary and secondary star temperatures ($T_{eff},1$ and $T_{eff},2$), mass ratio (q), and primary star luminosity (L1) with associated errors. For KIC 8504570: $T_{eff},1$ (7400.9 $\pm$ 1.6) K, $T_{eff},2$ (5450.0 $\pm$ 1.0) K, q (0.5208 $\pm$ 0.0002), and L1 (11.8043 $\pm$ 0.0006)$L_\odot$. For SX Dra: $T_{eff},1$ (7729.7 $\pm$ 1.1) K , $T_{eff},2$ (4927.5 $\pm$ 0.5) K, q (0.4772 $\pm$ 0.0006), and L1 (7.0474 $\pm$ 0.0015)$L_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXI: Limited role of streamers in mass supply to the disk in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16544-1604</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric and narrow infalling structures, often called streamers, have been observed in several Class 0/I protostars, which is not expected in the classical star formation picture. Their origin and impact on the disk formation remain observationally unclear. By combining data from the James Cleark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we investigate the physical properties of the streamers and parental dense core in the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 16544$-$1604. Three prominent streamers associated to the disk with lengths between 2800 to 5800 au, are identified on the northern side of the protostar in the C$^{18}$O emission. Their mass and mass infalling rates are estimated to be in the range of (1-4)$\times$10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ and (1-5)$\times$10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Infall signatures are also observed in the more diffuse extended protostellar envelope observed with the ALMA from the comparison to the infalling and rotating envelope model. The parental dense core detected by the JCMT observation has a mass of $\sim$0.5 $M_\odot$, sub to transonic turbulence of $\mathcal{M}$ $=$ 0.8-1.1, and a mass-to-flux ratio of 2-6. Our results show that the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 only possess 2% of the entire dense core mass and contribute less than 10% of the mass infalling rate of the protostellar envelope. Therefore, the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 play a minor role in the mass accretion process onto the disk, in contrast to those streamers observed in other sources and those formed in numerical simulations of collapsing dense cores with similar turbulence and magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>ATOMIUM: Dust and tracers of binarity in the continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.24 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative bipolar features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are dynamical systems formed by two stars that are physically bound by the gravitational force. Binary stars are privileged laboratories, allowing one to measure the fundamental properties of stars but also potentially changing the way stars live and die. Because of this, binary stars have continuously played a central role in astrophysics. In this chapter, we focus on the observational properties of binary stars. What are the fundamental quantities that describe binaries? How do we detect and classify them? Which parameters can we constrain for different type of objects?</description>

      <title>Determination of Speed and Source Height of Coronal Shock Waves Using Type II Solar Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the shock speed and source height of coronal shock waves using Type II solar radio bursts. The solar radio burst data from January 2022 to October 2023 were obtained from eCALLISTO archive. The type II radio bursts were isolated from the spectra through a rigorous noise reduction process by taking the maximum intensity of each time channel. Using plasma oscillations and electron density models for the solar corona, explicit expressions for shock speed and source height were obtained. From the dynamic spectra, the starting frequency of a burst was obtained and using these parameters shock speed and source height were calculated. Results confirmed shock speeds ranging from 343 to 1032 kms$^{-1}$ with average speed of 650$\pm$226 kms$^{-1}$ and source heights 1.317-1.724 R$_\odot$, with high precision in formula predictions. The study highlights the need for broader burst type inclusion in future research and underscores the efficacy of the developed methodologies to improve space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Modeling hot, anisotropic ion beams in the solar wind motivated by the Parker Solar Probe observations near perihelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the solar wind ions by the SPAN-I instruments on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft at solar perihelia (Encounters) 4 and closer find ample evidence of complex anisotropic non-Maxwellian velocity distributions that consist of core, beam, and `hammerhead' (i.e., anisotropic beam) populations. The proton core populations are anisotropic, with T_perp/T||&gt;1, and the beams have super-Alfvenic speed relative to the core (we provide an example from Encounter 17). The alpha-particle population show similar features as the protons. These unstable VDFs are associated with enhanced, right-hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) polarized ion-scale kinetic wave activity, detected by the FIELDS instrument. Motivated by PSP observations, we employ nonlinear hybrid models to investigate the evolution of the anisotropic hot-beam VDFs and model the growth and the nonlinear stage of ion kinetic instabilities in several linearly unstable cases. The models are initialized with ion VDFs motivated by the observational parameters. We find rapidly growing (in terms of proton gyroperiods) combined ion-cyclotron (IC) and magnetosonic (MS) instabilities, which produce LH and RH ion-scale wave spectra, respectively. The modeled ion VDFs in the nonlinear stage of the evolution are qualitatively in agreement with PSP observations of the anisotropic core and `hammerhead' velocity distributions, quantifying the effect of the ion kinetic instabilities on wind plasma heating close to the Sun. We conclude that the wave-particle interactions play an important role in the energy transfer between the magnetic energy (waves) and random particle motion leading to anisotropic solar wind plasma heating.</description>

      <title>Simulations of entropy rain-driven convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The paradigm of convection in solar-like stars is questioned based on recent solar observations. Aims: The primary aim is to study the effects of surface-driven entropy rain on convection zone structure and flows. Methods: Simulations of compressible convection in Cartesian geometry with non-uniform surface cooling are used. The cooling profile includes localized cool patches that drive deeply penetrating plumes. Results are compared with cases with uniform cooling. Results: Sufficiently strong surface driving leads to strong non-locality and a largely subadiabatic convectively mixed layer. In such cases the net convective energy transport is done almost solely by the downflows. The spatial scale of flows decreases with increasing number of cooling patches for the vertical flows whereas the horizontal flows still peak at large scales. Conclusions: To reach the plume-dominated regime with a predominantly subadiabatic bulk of the convection zone requires significantly more efficient entropy rain than what is realized in simulations with uniform cooling. It is plausible that this regime is realized in the Sun but that it occurs on scales smaller than those resolved currently. Current results show that entropy rain can lead to largely mildly subadiabatic convection zone, whereas its effects for the scale of convection are more subtle.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Harmonic Emissions Excited by Energetic Electrons in Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a key process that drives the energy release in solar flares. This process can occur at multiple locations along the coronal loop. The reconnection generates energetic electrons capable of exciting wave modes and emissions as they propagate through the loop. In this follow-up study, we investigate the influence of the injection site location of these energetic electrons - either at the looptop (LT) or at the leg of the loop around a footpoint (FP) - on the excitation of wave modes especially the second harmonic emissions (X2) in coronal loops. Our simulations reveal that the injection location significantly impacts the spatial distribution and intensity of excited wave modes. When electrons are injected at the LT, electromagnetic X2, and Z modes dominate along the loop, with minimal excitation of Langmuir waves (Yousefzadeh et al. 2021; 2022). Conversely, the present study reveals that injection close to FP leads to a strong Langmuir wave excitation throughout the loop, particularly as electrons ascend toward the LT. We find that X2 and Z modes are consistently excited at the injection site with different intensities, regardless of the injection location. However, electron injection near the FP scenario creates favorable conditions for significant Langmuir wave generation, potentially leading to plasma emission under specific circumstances. These findings emphasize the importance of electron injection location in determining the properties of the excited and emitted waves in solar coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.</description>

      <title>An on-the-fly line-driven-wind iterative mass-loss estimator (LIME) for hot, massive stars of arbitrary chemical compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-loss rates from hot, massive stars are important for a range of astrophysical applications. We present a fast, efficient, and trivial-to-use real-time mass-loss calculator for line-driven winds from hot, massive stars with given stellar parameters and arbitrary chemical compositions, and make it available for public use via the world wide web (https://lime.ster.kuleuven.be/). The line-force is computed on-the-fly from excitation and ionisation balance calculations using a large atomic data base consisting of more than 4 million spectral lines. Mass-loss rates are then derived from line-driven wind theory including effects of a finite stellar disk and gas sound speed. For a given set of stellar parameters and chemical composition, we obtain predictions for the mass-loss rate and the three line-force parameters Qbar, Q0, and alpha at the wind critical point. Comparison of our predictions to a large sample of recent state-of-the-art, homogeneously derived empirical mass-loss rates obtained from the XshootU collaboration project (Vink et al. 2023) demonstrates that the super-simple calculator provided in this paper on average performs even better than the mass-loss recipes by Vink et al. (2001), Bjorklund et al. (2023), and Krticka et al. (2024) (which are all fits to restricted model grids based on more sophisticated, but also more intricate and much less flexible, methods). In addition to its speed and simplicity, a strength of our mass-loss calculator is that it avoids uncertainties related to applying fit-formulae to underlying model-grids calculated for more restricted parameter ranges. In particular, individual chemical abundances can here be trivially modified and their effects upon predicted mass-loss rates readily explored. This thus allows also for direct applications toward stars that are significantly chemically modified at the surface.</description>

      <title>The International Axion Observatory (IAXO): case, status and plans. Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a next-generation axion helioscope designed to search for solar axions with unprecedented sensitivity. IAXO holds a unique position in the global landscape of axion searches, as it will probe a region of the axion parameter space inaccessible to any other experiment. In particular, it will explore QCD axion models in the mass range from meV to eV, covering scenarios motivated by astrophysical observations and potentially extending to axion dark matter models. Several studies in recent years have demonstrated that IAXO has the potential to probe a wide range of new physics beyond solar axions, including dark photons, chameleons, gravitational waves, and axions from nearby supernovae. IAXO will build upon the two-decade experience gained with CAST, the detailed studies for BabyIAXO, which is currently under construction, as well as new technologies. If, in contrast to expectations, solar axion searches with IAXO ``only'' result in limits on new physics in presently uncharted parameter territory, these exclusions would be very robust and provide significant constraints on models, as they would not depend on untestable cosmological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Searching for exotic object companions in the dense core of NGC 362: a multi-wavelength and multi-epoch photometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense cores of globular clusters (GCs) are efficient environments for the production of exotic stellar populations, including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Most of these objects likely form through two- and three-body interactions and are useful tracers of the cluster's dynamical evolution. In this work we explore the exotic object population in the galactic GC NGC 362, searching for the optical counterpart of 33 X-ray sources identified within 1 arcmin from the cluster center. To this aim, we exploit a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data-set, obtained in eight different epochs and covering a wavelength range from near UV to the optical I band. To identify the most promising counterparts we follow a multi-step analysis, which is based on four main ingredients, namely positional coincidence, position in the colour-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs), H$\alpha$ excess and photometric variability. In addition, we complement the photometric analysis with spectroscopic information coming from the analysis of MUSE radial velocity (RV) curves. Thanks to this multi-diagnostic approach, we are able to identify 28 high-confidence optical counterparts, including several candidate MSPs, active binaries (ABs) and CVs. The most intriguing counterparts include a candidate black widow (BW) system, an eclipsing binary blue straggler, and a system in outburst, potentially representing either a LMXB or a nova eruption from a CV. The candidate MSPs proposed in this work will contribute to ongoing radio analyses with MeerKAT for the identification and detailed study of MSPs in NGC 362.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray measurements from GeV to PeV energies have provided us with a wealth of information on diffuse emission and sources in the Universe lately. With improved spatial and temporal resolutions together with real-time multimessenger astronomy, the modeling of 3D cosmic-ray transport becomes more and more important to explain the data. Here, we will give a compact summary of how cosmic-ray propagation in very different astrophysical environments like the Sun, Milky Way, and active galaxies can be constrained by combining 3D modeling with the propagation software CRPropa with gamma-ray measurements.</description>

      <title>Review and prospects of hot exozodiacal dust research for future exo-Earth direct imaging missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot exozodiacal dust is dust in the innermost regions of planetary systems, at temperatures around 1000K to 2000K, and commonly detected by near-infrared interferometry. The phenomenon is poorly understood and has received renewed attention as a potential risk to a planned future space mission to image potentially habitable exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres (exo-Earth imaging) such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this article, we review the current understanding of hot exozodiacal dust and its implications for HWO. We argue that the observational evidence suggests that the phenomenon is most likely real and indeed caused by hot dust, although conclusive proof in particular of the latter statement is still missing. Furthermore, we find that there exists as of yet no single model that is able to successfully explain the presence of the dust. We find that it is plausible and not unlikely that large amounts of hot exozodiacal dust in a system will critically limit the sensitivity of exo-Earth imaging observations around that star. It is thus crucial to better understood the phenomenon in order to be able to evaluate the actual impact on such a mission, and current and near-future observational opportunities for acquiring the required data exist. At the same time, hot exozodiacal dust (and warm exozodiacal dust closer to a system's habitable zone) has the potential to provide important context for HWO observations of rocky, HZ planets, constraining the environment in which these planets exist and hence to determine why a detected planet may be capable to sustain life or not.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry and Dynamical Constraints in 2-Limbs Retrieval of WASP-39 b Inferring from JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.</description>

      <title>Effects of chemically homogeneous evolution of the first stars on the 21-cm signal and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE are comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>XUE. Thermochemical Modeling Suggests a Compact and Gas-Depleted Structure for a Distant, Irradiated Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling the physical structure of protoplanetary disk is crucial for interpreting the diversity of the exoplanet population. Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking. We use the thermochemical code ProDiMo to model JWST/MIRI spectroscopy and archival visual/near-infrared photometry aiming to constrain the physical structure of the irradiated disk around the solar-mass star XUE 1 in NGC 6357 ($d \approx 1690$ pc). Our findings are: (1) Mid-infrared dust emission features are explained by amorphous and crystalline silicates with compositions similar to nearby disks. (2) The molecular features detected with MIRI originate within the first $\sim 1$ au, consistent with slab models' results. (3) Our model favors a disk truncated at $10$ au with a gas-to-dust ratio of unity in the outskirts. (4) Comparing models of the same disk structure under different irradiation levels, we find that strong external irradiation raises gas temperature tenfold and boosts water abundance beyond $10$ au by a factor of $100$. Our findings suggest the inner disk resists external irradiation, retaining the elements necessary for planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetic Fields in the Formation of High-Mass Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho &gt; 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.</description>

      <title>UVIT Data Release version 7: Regenerated high-level UVIT data products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat is an active telescope capable of high-resolution far-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5'') and low resolution (${\lambda}/{\delta}{\lambda}$ $\approx$ 100) slitless spectroscopy with a field of view as large as ~0.5 degrees. Now almost a decade old, UVIT continues to be operational and generates valuable data for the scientific community. UVIT is also capable of near-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5''); however, the near-ultraviolet channel stopped working in August 2018 after providing data for nearly three years. This article gives an overview of the latest version (7.0.1) of the UVIT pipeline and UVIT Data Release version 7. The high-level products generated using pipeline versions having a major version number of seven will be called "UVIT Data Release version 7". The latest pipeline version overcomes the two limitations of the previous version (6.3), namely (a) the inability to combine all episode-wise images and (b) the failure of the astrometry module in a large fraction of the observations. The procedures adopted to overcome these two limitations, as well as a comparison of the performance of this new version over the previous one, are presented in this paper. The UVIT Data Release version 7 products are available at the Indian Space Science Data Center of the Indian Space Research Organisation for archival and dissemination from 01 June 2024. The new pipeline version is open source and made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>

Abstract: ADITYA L1, India's first dedicated mission to study Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on September 2, 2023 with seven payloads. Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on ADITYA-L1. VELC has provision to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in continuum at 5000{\AA}, with the field of view (FoV) from 1.05$R_\odot$ to 3$R_\odot$ can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303{\AA} [Fe XIV], 7892{\AA} [Fe XI], and 10747{\AA} [Fe XIII] are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50${\mu}$m, separated by 3.75mm helps to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to ${\pm}$1.5$R_\odot$ with variable step size. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747{\AA} also in the FoV range 1.05-1.5$R_\odot$. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

      <title>Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch -- A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features</title>

Abstract: In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova \sn, exploded in NGC~3206 at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model for the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than radioactive decays and H recombination. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN~2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5$\msun~surrounded by an extended envelope of only 0.2\msun~with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of 0.048\msun. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of \ion{He}{II} Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we confirmed that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Realistic predictions for Gaia black hole discoveries: comparison of isolated binary and dynamical formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.</description>
