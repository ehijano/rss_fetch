      <title>Spatiotemporal organization of chemical oscillators via phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chemical oscillators in the presence of phase separation. By imposing timescale separation between slow reactions and fast diffusion, we define a dynamics at phase equilibrium for the relevant degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that phase separation affects reaction kinetics by localizing reactants within phases, allowing for control of oscillator frequency and amplitude. The analysis is validated with a spatial model. Finally, relaxing the timescale separation between reactions and diffusion leads to waves of phase equilibria at mesoscopic scales.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and competition of basepairing and electrostatic interactions in mixtures of DNA nanostars and polylysine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in biomolecular mixtures can result from multiple physical interactions, which may act either complementarily or antagonistically. In the case of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have contrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing the driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions between nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by added salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay, we combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model solution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a function of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition. Despite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base pairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and temperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various conditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase separation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of nonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long timescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and base pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition various NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate how the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the complexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of interaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations in a polar fluid: confronting stochastic density functional theory to simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a Stochastic Density Functional Theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory's validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.</description>

      <title>Exact model of aerotactic band: From Fokker-Planck equation to band structure and fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of bacterial species spontaneously assemble in aerotactic band, local accumulation at a fixed distance from the air-water interface. Although the phenomenon is long known, its modelling is so far limited to mesoscopic, one-dimensional or numerical descriptions. We investigate band properties at the microscopic scale using exact solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we show that the interplay between oxygen consumption and tumbling modulation is governed by a third-order nonlinear differential equation relating the oxygen concentration to the aerotactic response. For two model aerotactic behaviors, we present analytical solutions and discuss the resulting band structure. Second, we investigate how an aerotactic band of magnetotactic bacteria in a magnetic field induces a spontaneous fluid flow, as observed in experiments [Marmol et al, arXiv 2025]. In the low field limit, we determine the bacterial distribution and the active stress tensor. Using the Green function of the hydrodynamic problem, we obtain a prediction for the fluid flow that is both simple and consistent with observations. Altogether, our results provide a model system of aerotactic band and solid ground to analyze aerotaxis-driven self-organization.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the \textit{cage state}, a structural quantity that captures the most likely positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations alone. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</description>

      <title>A general model for frictional contacts in colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In simulations of colloidal matter, frictional contacts between particles are often neglected. For spherical colloids, such an approximation can be problematic, since frictional contacts couple translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which may affect the collective behavior of, e.g., colloids under shear and chiral active matter. Deterministic models for frictional contacts have been proposed in the granular matter community. On the colloidal scale, however, thermal fluctuations are important and should be included in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Here, we derive the correct fluctuation-dissipation relation for linear and nonlinear instantaneous frictional contact interactions. Among other, this generates a new generalized class of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with rotation-translation coupling. We demonstrate effects of frictional contact interactions using the examples of Poiseuille flow and motility induced phase separation in active Langevin particles.</description>

      <title>Defect-Mediated Melting of Square-Lattice Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory successfully explains the melting mechanism of two-dimensional isotropic lattices as a two-step process driven by the unbinding of topological defects. By considering the elastic theory of the square lattice, we extend the KTHNY theory to melting of square lattice solids. In addition to the familiar elastic constants that govern the theory -- the Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio -- a third constant controlling the anisotropy of the medium emerges. This modifies both the logarithmic and angular interactions between the topological defects. Despite this modification, the extended theory retains the qualitative features of the isotropic case, predicting a two-step melting with an intermediate tetratic phase. However, some subtle differences arise, including a modified bound on the translational correlation exponent and the absence of universal values for the Young's modulus at the solid-to-tetratic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Graph-Coarsening for Machine Learning Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can simulate large molecular complexes over extended timescales by reducing degrees of freedom. A critical step in CG modeling is the selection of the CG mapping algorithm, which directly influences both accuracy and interpretability of the model. Despite progress, the optimal strategy for coarse-graining remains a challenging task, highlighting the necessity for a comprehensive theoretical framework. In this work, we present a graph-based coarsening approach to develop CG models. Coarse-grained sites are obtained through edge contractions, where nodes are merged based on a local variational cost metric while preserving key spectral properties of the original graph. Furthermore, we illustrate how Message Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE) can be applied to generate ML-CG potentials that are not only highly efficient but also accurate. Our approach provides a bottom-up, theoretically grounded computational method for the development of systematically improvable CG potentials.</description>

      <title>Generalized non-reciprocal phase transitions in multipopulation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading to phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical physics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two populations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems with a general number of populations is not well explored despite the potential relevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and phase transitions that emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with multiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models such as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems where each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the possible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent phases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral phases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via a phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as limit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we find a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry occurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken orbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to homoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\geq4$ populations. The results contribute to the understanding of the novel collective behavior and provide formalism for classifying dynamic phases and their transitions in systems driven by non-reciprocal interactions.</description>

      <title>Collective synchrony in confluent, pulsatile epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cell migration lies at the intersection of developmental biology and non-equilibrium physics, where active processes give rise to emergent patterns that are biologically relevant. Here, we investigate dilatational modes--cycles of expansion and contraction--in epithelial monolayers, and show that the divergence of the velocity field exhibits robust, large-scale temporal oscillations. These oscillatory patterns, reminiscent of excitable media and their biological analogs, emerge spontaneously from the coupled dynamics of actively pulsing cells. We find that the temporal persistence of these oscillations varies non-monotonically with cell density: synchrony initially increases with density, reaches a maximum at intermediate densities and is lost at higher values. This trend mirrors changes in the spatial correlation length of cell-cell interactions, and the density of topological defects in the system, suggesting a shared physical origin. We develop a continuum model in which a complex-valued Ginzburg-Landau-type field that governs the amplitude and phase of oscillations is coupled to local cell density. Simulations reproduce the observed behavior, revealing that local density adapts to phase patterns, reinforcing temporal coherence up to a critical density, and variations in the density of topological defects as a function of cell density. Extending our analysis to breast cancer cell lines with increasing invasiveness, we find that malignant cells exhibit longer phase persistence and fewer topological defects, suggesting a mechanistic link between temporal coherence and metastatic potential. Together, these results highlight the role of density-dependent synchrony dynamics as a fundamental, quantifiable mode of collective behavior in active epithelial matter, with implications for morphogenesis, cancer progression, and tissue diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Taylor swimming sheet under a finite Brinkman layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An asymptotic approach is employed to study the swimming speed of a two-dimensional Taylor swimming sheet beneath a Brinkman layer of finite thickness. This configuration is representative of a swimmer confined within a porous non-Newtonian boundary and could model microscopic filter feeders like choanoflagellates and sponges or the mucociliary escalator in the lungs. When ignoring the effects of jump stress and porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet decreases as the thickness and lower boundary of the Brinkman layer increase. The same is true as the permeability of the layer decreases. Including porosity effects with a zero jump stress enhances the swimming velocity of the sheet for porosity values near unity and decreases the swimming velocity for smaller porosity values. In the absence of porosity, the swimming speed of the sheet increases for positive-valued jump stresses and decreases for negative ones. Coupling nonzero jump stress with a variable porosity establishes complex behavior, with the sheet's swimming speed attaining a maximum, surpassing that found for the Newtonian case, particularly in thin or low-permeability Brinkman layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining a fundamental understanding of turbulent flows of dilute polymer solutions has been a challenging and outstanding problem for a long time. In this letter, we examine homogeneous, isotropic polymeric turbulence at large Reynolds and Deborah numbers through direct numerical simulations. While at the largest scales of the flow inertial turbulence exists, we find that the flow is fundamentally altered from Newtonian turbulence below the Kolmogorov scale. We demonstrate that `Elastic Turbulence' exists at the smallest scales of polymeric turbulence by quantifying multiple statistical properties of the flow - energy spectrum and flux in Fourier space as well as the spatial statistics of the velocity field - the structure functions and kurtosis, and energy dissipation. Our results show the coexistence of two fundamentally distinct types of turbulence in polymeric fluids and point to the ubiquity of elastic turbulence, which was hitherto only known to exist for negligible inertia.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>The effect of stereochemical constraints on the structural properties of folded proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. Several key features, such as the radius of gyration, fraction of core amino acids $f_{\rm core}$, packing fraction $\langle \phi\rangle$ of core amino acids, and structure factor $S(q)$ define the structure of folded proteins. It is well-known that folded proteins are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ and $\nu \sim 1/3$, $f_{\rm core} \approx 0.09$, and $\langle \phi \rangle \approx 0.55$. We also investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for subchains of length $n$ and show that it does not obey simple power-law scaling with $\nu \sim 1/3$. Instead, $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 &gt; 1/3$ for small $n$ and smaller exponent $\nu_{2} &lt; 1/3$ for large $n$. To develop a minimal model for proteins that recapitulates these defining structural features, we carry out collapse simulations for a series of coarse-grained models with increasing complexity. We show that a model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone bead and several variable-sized side-chain beads and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints for the backbone, recapitulates $R_g(n)$, $f_{\rm core}$, $\langle \phi \rangle$, and $S(q)$ for more than $2500$ x-ray crystal structures of proteins.</description>

Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, for example, in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study theoretically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their analysis. Here, we characterize glassy dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition, a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum. We show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation, and thus, we propose a model-agnostic signature for robustly detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of a one-dimensional ODE and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>
