      <title>Learning optimal treatment strategies for intraoperative hypotension using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods of surgical decision making heavily rely on human experience and prompt actions, which are variable. A data-driven system generating treatment recommendations based on patient states can be a substantial asset in perioperative decision-making, as in cases of intraoperative hypotension, for which suboptimal management is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and morbid postoperative complication. We developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to recommend optimum dose of intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors during surgery to avoid intraoperative hypotension and postoperative AKI. We retrospectively analyzed 50,021 surgeries from 42,547 adult patients who underwent major surgery at a quaternary care hospital between June 2014 and September 2020. Of these, 34,186 surgeries were used for model training and 15,835 surgeries were reserved for testing. We developed a Deep Q-Networks based RL model using 16 variables including intraoperative physiologic time series, total dose of IV fluid and vasopressors extracted for every 15-minute epoch. The model replicated 69% of physician's decisions for the dosage of vasopressors and proposed higher or lower dosage of vasopressors than received in 10% and 21% of the treatments, respectively. In terms of IV fluids, the model's recommendations were within 0.05 ml/kg/15 min of the actual dose in 41% of the cases, with higher or lower doses recommended for 27% and 32% of the treatments, respectively. The model resulted in a higher estimated policy value compared to the physicians' actual treatments, as well as random and zero-drug policies. AKI prevalence was the lowest in patients receiving medication dosages that aligned with model's decisions. Our findings suggest that implementation of the model's policy has the potential to reduce postoperative AKI and improve other outcomes driven by intraoperative hypotension.</description>

      <title>A Graph Completion Method that Jointly Predicts Geometry and Topology Enables Effective Molecule Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common starting point for drug design is to find small chemical groups or "fragments" that form interactions with distinct subregions in a protein binding pocket. The subsequent challenge is to assemble these fragments into a molecule that has high affinity to the protein, by adding chemical bonds between atoms in different fragments. This "molecule assembly" task is particularly challenging because, initially, fragment positions are known only approximately. Prior methods for spatial graph completion-adding missing edges to a graph whose nodes have associated spatial coordinates-either treat node positions as fixed or adjust node positions before predicting edges. The fact that these methods treat geometry and topology prediction separately limits their ability to reconcile noisy geometries and plausible connectivities. To address this limitation, we introduce EdGr, a spatial graph diffusion model that reasons jointly over geometry and topology of molecules to simultaneously predict fragment positions and inter-fragment bonds. Importantly, predicted edge likelihoods directly influence node position updates during the diffusion denoising process, allowing connectivity cues to guide spatial movements, and vice versa. EdGr substantially outperforms previous methods on the molecule assembly task and maintains robust performance as noise levels increase. Beyond drug discovery, our approach of explicitly coupling geometry and topology prediction is broadly applicable to spatial graph completion problems, such as neural circuit reconstruction, 3D scene understanding, and sensor network design.</description>

      <title>HelixDesign-Binder: A Scalable Production-Grade Platform for Binder Design Built on HelixFold3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein binder design is central to therapeutics, diagnostics, and synthetic biology, yet practical deployment remains challenging due to fragmented workflows, high computational costs, and complex tool integration. We present HelixDesign-Binder, a production-grade, high-throughput platform built on HelixFold3 that automates the full binder design pipeline, from backbone generation and sequence design to structural evaluation and multi-dimensional scoring. By unifying these stages into a scalable and user-friendly system, HelixDesign-Binder enables efficient exploration of binder candidates with favorable structural, energetic, and physicochemical properties. The platform leverages Baidu Cloud's high-performance infrastructure to support large-scale design and incorporates advanced scoring metrics, including ipTM, predicted binding free energy, and interface hydrophobicity. Benchmarking across six protein targets demonstrates that HelixDesign-Binder reliably produces diverse and high-quality binders, some of which match or exceed validated designs in predicted binding affinity. HelixDesign-Binder is accessible via an interactive web interface in PaddleHelix platform, supporting both academic research and industrial applications in antibody and protein binder development.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a molecular species remains entirely invariant to changes in total molecular supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate -- but not exact -- robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor side reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of the network itself. In this work, we highlight a previously underappreciated phenomenon, which we term {\em asymptotic ACR} (or {\em aACR}): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the architecture of the reaction network, without requiring parameters being negligible or the presence of an exact ACR motif. We find that aACR is far more common than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the \textit{Escherichia coli} EnvZ-OmpR system and MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structures. Finally, we reveal a counterintuitive feature of aACR in systems with multiple conserved quantities, revealing subtle distinctions in how robustness manifests in complex biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>YH-MINER: Multimodal Intelligent System for Natural Ecological Reef Metric Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs, crucial for sustaining marine biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, habitat provision), face escalating threats, underscoring the need for efficient monitoring. Coral reef ecological monitoring faces dual challenges of low efficiency in manual analysis and insufficient segmentation accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. This study develops the YH-MINER system, establishing an intelligent framework centered on the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM) for "object detection-semantic segmentation-prior input". The system uses the object detection module (mAP@0.5=0.78) to generate spatial prior boxes for coral instances, driving the segment module to complete pixel-level segmentation in low-light and densely occluded scenarios. The segmentation masks and finetuned classification instructions are fed into the Qwen2-VL-based multimodal model as prior inputs, achieving a genus-level classification accuracy of 88% and simultaneously extracting core ecological metrics. Meanwhile, the system retains the scalability of the multimodal model through standardized interfaces, laying a foundation for future integration into multimodal agent-based underwater robots and supporting the full-process automation of "image acquisition-prior generation-real-time analysis".</description>

      <title>Automating tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte assessment in breast cancer histopathology images using QuPath: a transparent and accessible machine learning pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we built an end-to-end tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) assessment pipeline within QuPath, demonstrating the potential of easily accessible tools to perform complex tasks in a fully automatic fashion. First, we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&amp;E-stained whole-slide images (WSI) to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores, achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&amp;E-stained WSIs of breast cancer.</description>

      <title>DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</description>
