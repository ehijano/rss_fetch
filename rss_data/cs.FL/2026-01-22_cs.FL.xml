      <title>A Myhill-Nerode Characterization and Active Learning for One-Clock Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Myhill-Nerode style characterization for languages recognized by one-clock deterministic timed automata (1-DTA). Although there is only one clock, distinct automata may reset it differently along the same word. This adds a significant challenge in the search for a canonical automaton. Our characterization is based on a new perspective of 1-DTAs in terms of "half-integral" words that they accept, along with the reset information encoded by them. We apply our results to develop L* style algorithms that learn the canonical 1-DTA.</description>

      <title>A Complete Propositional Dynamic Logic for Regular Expressions with Lookahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (logical) reasoning for regular expressions with lookahead (REwLA). In this paper, we give an axiomatic characterization for both the (match-)language equivalence and the largest substitution-closed equivalence that is sound for the (match-)language equivalence. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on finite linear orders, extended with two operators: the restriction to the identity relation and the restriction to its complement. Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA.</description>

      <title>Co-Buchi Barrier Certificates for Discrete-time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrier certificates provide functional overapproximations for the reachable set of dynamical systems and provide inductive guarantees on the safe evolution of the system. In automata-theoretic verification, a key query is to determine whether the system visits a given predicate over the states finitely often, typically resulting from the complement of the traditional Buchi acceptance condition. This paper proposes a barrier certificate approach to answer such queries by developing a notion of co-Buchi barrier certificates (CBBCs) that generalize classic barrier certificates to ensure that the traces of a system visit a given predicate a fixed number of times. Our notion of CBBC is inspired from bounded synthesis paradigm to LTL realizability, where the LTL specifications are converted to safety automata via universal co-Buchi automata with a bound on final state visitations provided as a hyperparameter. Our application of CBBCs in verification is analogous: we fix a bound and search for a suitable barrier certificate, increasing the bound if no suitable function can be found. We then use these CBBCs to verify our system against properties specified by co-Buchi automata and demonstrate their effectiveness via some case studies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Anytime Algorithms for Learning Fragments of Linear Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a specification language for finite sequences (called traces) widely used in program verification, motion planning in robotics, process mining, and many other areas. We consider the problem of learning LTL formulas for classifying traces; despite a growing interest of the research community, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: they do not scale beyond small formulas, and they may exhaust computational resources without returning any result. We introduce a new algorithm addressing both issues: our algorithm is able to construct formulas an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, and it is anytime, meaning that it in most cases successfully outputs a formula, albeit possibly not of minimal size. We evaluate the performances of our algorithm using an open source implementation against publicly available benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Monadic Context Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.</description>
