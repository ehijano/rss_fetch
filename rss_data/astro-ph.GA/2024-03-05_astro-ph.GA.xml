      <title>Dynamical modelling and origin of gas turbulence in z $\sim$ 4.5 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a growing number of regularly rotating galaxy discs have been found at z $\geq$ 4. Such systems provide us with the unique opportunity to study the properties of dark matter halos at these early epochs, the turbulence within the interstellar medium and the evolution of scaling relations. Here, we investigate the dynamics of four gas discs in galaxies at \textit{z} $\sim$ 4.5 observed with ALMA in the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line. We aim to derive the structural properties of the gas, stars and dark matter halos of the galaxies and to study the mechanisms driving the turbulence in high-\textit{z} discs. We decompose the rotation curves into baryonic and dark matter components within the extent of the [CII] discs, i.e. 3 to 5 kpc. Furthermore, we use the gas velocity dispersion profiles as a diagnostic tool for the mechanisms driving the turbulence in the discs. We obtain total stellar, gas and dark matter masses in the ranges of $\log{(M/M_{\odot})} = 10.3 - 11.0$, $9.8 - 11.3$, and $11.2 - 13.3$, respectively. We find dynamical evidence in all four galaxies for the presence of compact stellar components, conceivably stellar bulges. The turbulence present in the galaxies appears to be primarily driven by stellar feedback, negating the necessity for large-scale gravitational instabilities. Finally, we investigate the position of our galaxies in the context of local scaling relations, in particular the stellar-to-halo mass and Tully-Fisher analogue relations.</description>

      <title>An early dark matter-dominated phase in the assembly history of Milky Way-mass galaxies suggested by the TNG50 simulation and JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas well-studied galaxies at cosmic noon are found to be baryon-dominated within the effective radius, recent JWST observations of $z\sim6-7$ galaxies with stellar masses of only $M_*\sim10^{8-9}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ surprisingly indicate that they are dark matter-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\approx 1\,$kpc. Here, we place these high-redshift measurements in the context of the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation, by measuring the central (within $1\,$kpc) stellar, gas, and dark matter masses of galaxies in the simulation. The central baryon fraction varies strongly with galaxy stellar mass in TNG50, and this $M_*$-dependence is remarkably constant across $0&lt;z&lt;6$: galaxies of low stellar mass ($M_*\sim10^{8-9}\,{\rm M_\odot}$) are dark matter-dominated, as $f_{\rm baryon}(&lt;1\,{\rm kpc})\sim0.25$. At $z=6$, the baryonic mass in the centers of low-mass galaxies is largely comprised of gas, exceeding the stellar mass component by a factor $\sim4$. We use the simulation to track the typical evolution of such low-mass dark matter-dominated galaxies at $z=6$, and show that these systems become baryon-dominated in their centers at cosmic noon, with high stellar-to-gas mass ratios, and grow to galaxies of $M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ at $z=0$. Comparing to the dynamical and stellar mass measurements from observations at high redshifts, these findings suggest that the inferred star formation efficiency in the early Universe is broadly in line with the established assumptions for the cosmological simulations. Moreover, our results imply that the JWST observations may indeed have reached the early, low-mass regime where the central parts of galaxies transition from being dark matter-dominated to being baryon-dominated.</description>

      <title>Faint millimeter NIKA2 dusty star-forming galaxies: finding the high-redshift population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to constrain the source redshift. The method jointly accounts for the detection/non-detection of spectral lines and the prior information from the photometric redshift and total infrared luminosity from spectral energy distribution analysis. The method uses the estimated total infrared luminosity to predict the line fluxes at given redshifts and generates model spectra. The redshift-dependent spectral models are then compared with the observed spectra to find the redshift. Results. We apply the aforementioned joint redshift analysis method to four high-z dusty star-forming galaxy candidates selected from the NIKA2 observations of the HLSJ091828.6+514223 (HLS) field, and further observed by NOEMA with blind spectral scans. These sources only have SPIRE/Herschel photometry as ancillary data. They were selected because of very faint or no SPIRE counterparts, as to bias the sample towards the highest redshift candidates. The method finds the spectroscopic redshift of 4 in the 5 NOEMA-counterpart detected sources, with z&gt;3. Based on these measurements, we derive the CO/[CI] lines and millimeter continuum fluxes from the NOEMA data and study their ISM and star-formation properties. We find cold dust temperatures in some of the HLS sources compared to the general population of sub-millimeter galaxies, which might be related to the bias introduced by the SPIRE-dropout selection. Our sources, but one, have short gas depletion time of a few hundred Myrs, which is typical among high-z sub-millimeter galaxies. The only exception shows a longer gas depletion time, up to a few Gyrs, comparable to that of main-sequence galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, we identify a possible over-density of dusty star-forming galaxies at z=5.2, traced by two sources in our sample, as well as the lensed galaxy HLSJ091828.6+514223.

      <title>Entrainment of Hot Gas into Cold Streams: The Origin of Excessive Star-formation Rates at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of cold streams from the cosmic web that feed galaxies through their shock-heated circumgalactic medium (CGM) at cosmic noon, $z\simeq 1-5$. In addition to the hydrodynamical instabilities and radiative cooling that we have incorporated in earlier works, we embed the stream and the hot CGM in the gravitational potential of the host dark-matter halo, deriving equilibrium profiles for both. Self-gravity within the stream is tentatively ignored. We find that the cold streams gradually entrain a large mass of initially hot CGM gas that cools in the mixing layer and condenses onto the stream. This entrainment, combined with the acceleration down the gravitational potential well, typically triples the inward cold inflow rate into the central galaxy, compared to the original rate at the virial radius, which makes the entrained gas the dominant source of gas supply to the galaxy. The potential sources for the hot gas to be entrained are recycled enriched gas that has been previously ejected from the galaxy, and fresh virial-shock-heated gas that has accumulated in the CGM. This can naturally elevate the star formation rate in the galaxy by a factor of $\sim 3$ compared to the gas accretion rate onto the halo, thus explaining the otherwise puzzling observed excess of star formation at cosmic noon. When accounting for self-shielding of dense gas from the UV background, we find that the energy radiated from the streams, originating predominantly from the cooling of the entrained gas, is consistent with observed Lyman-$\alpha$ blobs around galaxies.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we learn more about the multi-scale interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, we develop a greater understanding for the complex relationships between the large-scale diffuse gas and dust in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), how it moves, how it is affected by the nearby massive stars, and which portions of those GMCs eventually collapse into star forming regions. The complex interactions of those gas, dust and stellar populations form what has come to be known as the ecology of our Galaxy. Because we are deeply embedded in the plane of our Galaxy, it takes up a significant fraction of the sky, with complex dust lanes scattered throughout the optically recognisable bands of the Milky Way. These bands become bright at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths, where we can study dust thermal emission and the chemical and kinematic signatures of the gas. To properly study such large-scale environments, requires deep, large area surveys that are not possible with current facilities. Moreover, where stars form, so too do planetary systems, growing from the dust and gas in circumstellar discs, to planets and planetesimal belts. Understanding the evolution of these belts requires deep imaging capable of studying belts around young stellar objects to Kuiper belt analogues around the nearest stars. Here we present a plan for observing the Galactic Plane and circumstellar environments to quantify the physical structure, the magnetic fields, the dynamics, chemistry, star formation, and planetary system evolution of the galaxy in which we live with AtLAST; a concept for a new, 50m single-dish sub-mm telescope with a large field of view which is the only type of facility that will allow us to observe our Galaxy deeply and widely enough to make a leap forward in our understanding of our local ecology.</description>

      <title>Signatures of tidal disruption of the Hercules ultra-faint dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hercules ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) has long been hypothesized to be tidally disrupting, yet no conclusive evidence has been found for tidal disruption owing partly to difficulties in identifying Hercules member stars. In this work, we present a homogeneous re-analysis of new and existing observations of Hercules, including the detection of a new potential member star located $\sim$1 $^{\circ}$ ($\sim1.7$ kpc) west of the center of the system. In addition to measuring the line-of-sight velocity gradient, we compare predictions from dynamical models of stream formation to these observations. We report an updated velocity dispersion measurement based on 28 stars, $1.9^{+0.6}_{-0.6}$ km s$^{\rm -1}$, which is significantly lower than previous measurements. We find that the line-of-sight velocity gradient is $1.8^{+1.8}_{-1.8}$ km s$^{\rm -1}$ kpc$^{\rm -1}$ along the major axis of Hercules, consistent with zero within 1 $\sigma$. Our dynamical models of stream formation, on the other hand, can reproduce the morphology of the Hercules UFD, specifically the misalignment between the elongation and the orbital motion direction. Additionally, these dynamical models indicate that any radial velocity gradient from tidal disruption would be too small, $0.00^{+0.97}_{-0.91}$ km s$^{\rm -1}$ kpc$^{\rm -1}$, to be detectable with current sample sizes. Combined with our analysis of the tidal radius evolution of the system as a function of its orbital phase, we argue that it is likely that Hercules is indeed currently undergoing tidal disruption in its extended stellar halo with a line-of-sight velocity gradient too small to be detected with current observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: The hidden circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution has incredibly progressed through multi-wavelength observational constraints of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at all cosmic epochs. However, little is known about the physical properties of the more diffuse and lower surface brightness reservoir of gas and dust that extends beyond ISM scales and fills dark matter haloes of galaxies up to their virial radii, the circumgalactic medium (CGM). New theoretical studies increasingly stress the relevance of the latter for understanding the feedback and feeding mechanisms that shape galaxies across cosmic times, whose cumulative effects leave clear imprints into the CGM. Recent studies are showing that a -- so far unconstrained -- fraction of the CGM mass may reside in the cold (T &lt; 1e4 K) molecular and atomic phase, especially in high-redshift dense environments. These gas phases, together with the warmer ionised phase, can be studied in galaxies from z ~ 0 to z ~ 10 through bright far-infrared and sub-millimeter emission lines such as [C II] 158${\mu}$m, [O III] 88 ${\mu}$m, [C I] 609${\mu}$m, [C I] 370${\mu}$m, and the rotational transitions of CO. Imaging such hidden cold CGM can lead to a breakthrough in galaxy evolution studies but requires a new facility with the specifications of the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). In this paper, we use theoretical and empirical arguments to motivate future ambitious CGM observations with AtLAST and describe the technical requirements needed for the telescope and its instrumentation to perform such science.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission Strength and Stellar Properties of Faint Galaxies from $5 &lt; z &lt; 8.2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on stellar properties of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emitters at 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2. We use 247 photometrically-selected, lensed, high-redshift, low luminosity galaxy candidates with spectroscopic follow-up. Of these, 38 are confirmed spectroscopically to be between 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2 via detection of Ly$\alpha$. For each galaxy and candidate, we estimate stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and mass-weighted age with spectral energy distribution fitting. We also measure the UV $\beta$ slope and luminosity using values from photometry. We find no strong correlation between Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and any of these properties, as well as no significant difference between the physical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emitters and candidates without Ly$\alpha$ detected. This lack of expected trends may be explained by a combination of the evolving opacity of the IGM at these redshifts as well as the unique phase space probed by our lensed sample. Via tests on other galaxy samples which show varying strengths of correlations, we conclude that if there exist any relationships between Ly$\alpha$ EW and physical properties in the underlying population of faint galaxies, they are weak correlations. We also present the results of a spectroscopic search for CIII] emission in confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 7$, finding no CIII] detections, but putting constraints on strong AGN activity and extreme nebular emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on determining the characteristics of the young open cluster NGC 6383. To achieve this, the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm is utilized to identify potential cluster members based on proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 3. Various parameters of NGC 6383, such as tidal radius, core radius, distance through parallax and isochrone-fitting, proper motion, age, metallicity, and relevant others, are assessed. To perform this analysis, we utilize an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler. The results of this analysis point out that NGC 6383 is a very young open cluster $(\sim 1 - 4~\mathrm{Myr})$, with a distance of $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{kpc}$.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) science: Gas and dust in nearby galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical processes that regulate star formation and galaxy evolution are major areas of activity in modern astrophysics. Nearby galaxies offer unique opportunities to inspect interstellar medium (ISM), star formation (SF), radiative, dynamic and magnetic physics in great detail from sub-galactic (kpc) scales to sub-cloud (sub-pc) scales, from quiescent galaxies to starbursts, and from field galaxies to overdensities. In this case study, we discuss the major breakthroughs in this area of research that will be enabled by the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m single-dish submillimeter telescope. The new discovery space of AtLAST comes from its exceptional sensitivity, in particular to extended low surface brightness emission, a very large 2 degree field of view, and correspondingly high mapping efficiency. This paper focuses on four themes which will particularly benefit from AtLAST: 1) the LMC and SMC, 2) extragalactic magnetic fields, 3) the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium, and 4) star formation and galaxy evolution. With ~1000-2000h surveys each, AtLAST could deliver deep dust continuum maps of the entire LMC and SMC fields at parsec-scale resolution, high-resolution maps of the magnetic field structure, gas density, temperature and composition of the dense and diffuse ISM in ~100 nearby galaxies, as well as the first large-scale blind CO survey in the nearby Universe, delivering molecular gas masses for up to 10^6 galaxies (3 orders of magnitude more than current samples). Through such observing campaigns, AtLAST will have a profound impact on our understanding of the baryon cycle and star formation across a wide range of environments.</description>

      <title>Feedback and ionized gas outflows in four low-radio power AGN at z $\sim$0.15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of observations and simulations suggests that low-power (&lt;10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) jets may be a significant channel of feedback produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN), but little is known about their actual effect on their host galaxies from the observational point of view. We targeted four luminous type 2 AGN hosting moderately powerful radio emission ($\sim$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), two of which and possibly a third are associated with jets, with optical integral field spectroscopy observations from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to analyze the properties of their ionized gas as well as the properties and effects of ionized outflows. We combined these observations with Very Large Array (VLA) and e-MERLIN data to investigate the relations and interactions between the radio jets and host galaxies. We detected ionized outflows as traced by the fast bulk motion of the gas. The outflows extended over kiloparsec scales in the direction of the jet, when present. In the two sources with resolved radio jets, we detected a strong enhancement in the emission-line velocity dispersion (up to 1000 km s$^{-1}$) perpendicular to the direction of the radio jets. We also found a correlation between the mass and the energetics of this high-velocity dispersion gas and the radio power, which supports the idea that the radio emission may cause the enhanced turbulence. This phenomenon, which is now being observed in an increasing number of objects, might represent an important channel for AGN feedback on galaxies.</description>

      <title>Star-forming and Quiescent Central Galaxies Cluster Similarly: Implications for the Galaxy-Halo Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the clustering of low-redshift SDSS galaxies as a function of stellar mass ($10.0&lt;\log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.5$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) and compare the results to models of the galaxy--halo connection. We find that the auto-correlation functions of central galaxies exhibit little dependence on sSFR, with the well-known stronger clustering of quiescent galaxies mainly attributable to satellites. Because halo assembly history is known to affect distinct halo clustering, this result implies that there is little net correlation between halo assembly history and central galaxy sSFR. However, cross-correlations with satellites are stronger for quiescent centrals than star-forming centrals, consistent with quiescent centrals having more satellites in their haloes at fixed $M_*$, as found in SDSS group catalogues. We model the galaxy--halo connection in an $N$-body simulation by assigning sSFRs to central galaxies in three different ways. Two of the models depend on halo assembly history (being based on halo accretion rate or concentration), while the third is independent of halo assembly history (being based on peak halo circular velocity, $V_\text{peak}$, a proxy for halo mass). All three models replicate the observed auto-correlations of central galaxies, while only the $V_\text{peak}$ model reproduces the observed cross-correlations with satellites. This further suggests that the effects of halo assembly history may not be easily seen in auto-correlations of centrals and implies that a more complete understanding of central galaxy clustering may require more than auto-correlations of centrals alone. Additionally, the good agreement with the $V_\text{peak}$ model supports the idea that quiescent galaxies reside in more massive haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed $M_*$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic star formation in the Milky Way inferred from the unity index of KS law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a correlation analysis between the brightness temperature of the CO line and number density of HII regions in the longitude--velocity diagram (LVD) of the Milky Way in order to investigate the volumetric star-formation law. We determined the index $\alpha$ of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for the molecular gas defined by $\rho_{\rm SFR} \propto \rho_{\rm H_2}^\alpha$, where $\rho_{\rm SFR}$ is the SFR (star-formation rate) density and $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ is the molecular-gas density. We obtained $\alpha= 1.053 \pm 0.075$ and $1.031 \pm 0.067$ for the CO-line data from the Nobeyama 45-m and Columbia 1.2-m telescope Galactic plane surveys, respectively. This result is consistent with the KS indices currently determined for the molecular gas in the Milky Way as well as in spiral and starburst galaxies. We argue that an index close to 1 is universal in favour of stochastic (spontaneous) star formation, but is inconsistent with cloud-collision model, which predicts a steeper index of $\alpha=2$. We also suggest that the efficiency of star formation in the Galactic Centre is an order of magnitude lower than that in the disc.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Constraints on the Mid-Infrared Attenuation Curve: I - Attenuation Model using PAH Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model to spectroscopically constrain the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction/attenuation curve from 3--17 um, using Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission drawn from an AKARI-Spitzer extragalactic cross-archival dataset. Currently proposed MIR extinction curves vary significantly in their slopes toward the near-infrared, and the variation of the strengths and shapes of the 9.7 um and 18 um silicate absorption features make MIR spectral modeling and interpretation challenging, particularly for heavily obscured galaxies. By adopting the basic premise that PAH bands have relatively consistent intrinsic ratios within dusty starbursting galaxies, we can, for the first time, empirically determine the overall shape of the MIR attenuation curve by measuring the differential attenuation at specific PAH wavelengths. Our attenuation model shows PAH emission in most (U)LIRGs is unambiguously subjected to attenuation, and we find strong evidence that PAH bands undergo differential attenuation as obscuration increases. Compared to pre-existing results, the MIR attenuation curve derived from the model favors relatively gray continuum absorption from 3 -- 8 um and silicate features with intermediate strength at 9.7 um but with stronger than typical 18 um opacity.</description>

      <title>A study of the merging dwarf galaxy VCC322</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interactions and mergers can enhance or reduce star formation, but a complete understanding of the involved processes is still lacking. The effect of dwarf galaxy mergers is even less clear than their massive counterpart. We present a study on a dwarf merger remnant in the Virgo cluster, VCC322, which might form a triple system with VCC334 and VCC319. We identify a prominent long and straight tail-like substructure that has a size comparable to its host galaxy VCC322. By comparing the color-color ($g-r$ vs. $r-H$) distribution with simple stellar population models, we infer that the metallicity and stellar age of this tail are $Z_\star \sim 0.02~Z_\odot$ and $t_\star \sim 10$~Gyr, respectively. In VCC319, we find a sign of isophotal twisting. This suggests that VCC319 may be subject to tidal interaction. An analysis of the SDSS optical spectra of VCC322 indicates mass- and light-weighted ages of about 10$^{9.8}$ yr and 10$^{7.5}$ yr, respectively, indicating an ongoing star formation activity. However, the star formation in VCC322 seems suppressed when compared to other star-forming dwarfs of comparable stellar masses. Our finding of shock excitation of optical emission lines indicates that interaction-induced shock may contribute to the heating of cold gas and suppression of star formation.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Chemo-dynamics of the Galactic disk using the LAMOST and APOGEE red clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed measurement is made of the metallicity distributions, kinematics and dynamics of the thin and thick disks, across a large disk volume (5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars. The metallicity distributions results show that the radial metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R of the thin disk weakens with $|Z|$ from $-$0.06 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&lt;$ 0.25 kpc to $-$0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&gt;$ 2.75 kpc, while the thick disk displays a global weak positive $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R, generally weaker than 0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$. The vertical metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ weakened steadily from $-$0.36 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $R$ $\sim$ 5.5 kpc to $-$0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around R $&gt;$ 11.5 kpc for the thin disk, while the thick disk presents an almost constant value (nearly $-$0.06 $\sim$ $-$0.08 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for all the $R$ bins. These results indicate the contribution of the radial migration to the disk evolution, and the obvious north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may be linked to the disk warp and/or the disk perturbation events. The oscillations of the corrected $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ with $R$ are likely because of the resonances with the Galactic Bar. Our detailed measurements of $\Delta$V$_{\phi}$/$\Delta$[Fe/H] indicate an "inside-out" and "upside-down" star formation scenario for the thick disk. The results of eccentricity distributions and [$\alpha$/Fe]--velocity dispersion relations are likely to suggest that the thick disk stars require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dust torus size - luminosity relation based on a uniform reverberation mapping analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the torus size -- luminosity relation of Type 1 AGNs based on the reverberation-mapping analysis using the light curves of the optical continuum and the IR continuum obtained with the W1 and W2- bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey. The final sample consists of 446 and 416 AGNs, respectively, for W1 and W2- band light curves, covering a large dynamic range of bolometric luminosity from $10^{43.4}$ to $10^{47.6}$ $erg \, s^{-1}$, which show reliable lag measurements based on our quality assessment analysis. After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size ($R_{dust}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1- (W2) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K- band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as $R_{dust,K}:R_{dust,W1}:R_{dust,W2}$ = 1.0:1.5:1.8 ($R_{dust} \, \propto \, \lambda^{0.80}$) at $L_{bol}$ = $10^{46} \, erg \, s^{-1}$, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size -- luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the $R_{dust}$--$L_{bol}$ relationship.</description>

      <title>Grain growth and its chemical impact in the first hydrostatic core phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first hydrostatic core (FHSC) phase is a brief stage in the protostellar evolution that is difficult to detect. Our goal is to characterize the chemical evolution of gas and dust during the formation of the FHSC. Moreover, we are interested in analyzing, for the first time with 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the role of grain growth in its chemistry. We postprocessed $2\times10^{5}$ tracer particles from a $\texttt{RAMSES}$ non-ideal MHD simulation using the codes $\texttt{NAUTILUS}$ and $\texttt{SHARK}$ to follow the chemistry and grain growth throughout the simulation. A great chemical inheritance is seen, as gas-phase abundances of most of the C, O, N, and S reservoirs in the hot corino at the end of the simulation match the ice-phase abundances from the prestellar phase. Additionally, interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) such as methyl formate, acetaldehyde, and formamide are formed during the warm-up process. The typical grain size in the hot corino $(n_{\rm H}&gt;10^{11}\ {\rm cm^{-3}})$ increases forty-fold during the last 30 kyr, with negligible effects on its chemical composition. At moderate densities $(10^{10}&lt;n_{\rm H}&lt;10^{11}\ {\rm cm^{-3}})$ and cool temperatures $15&lt;T&lt;50$ K, increasing grain sizes delay molecular depletion. Finally, at low densities $(n_{\rm H}\sim10^{7}\ {\rm cm^{-3}})$, grains do not grow significantly. We also compared our results with a two-step model that reproduces well the abundances of C and O reservoirs, but not the N and S reservoirs. We conclude that the chemical composition of the FHSC is heavily determined by that of the parent prestellar core, chemo-MHD computations are needed for an accurate prediction of the abundances of the main N and S elemental reservoirs, and that the impact of grain growth in moderately dense areas delaying depletion permits the use of abundance ratios as grain growth proxies.</description>

      <title>Mass density profiles at kiloparsec scales using the sub-millimetre galaxies magnification bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for studying the distribution of mass in the Universe. Understanding the magnification bias effect in gravitational lensing and its impact on the flux of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) is crucial for accurate interpretations of observational data. This study aims to investigate the magnification bias effect and analyse the mass density profiles of different types of foreground lenses, including quasi-stellar objects, galaxies, and clusters. The specific goals are to compare the lens types, assess the impact of angular resolution on the analysis, and determine the adequacy of theoretical mass density profiles in explaining the observed data, using four different theoretical mass density profiles. The magnification bias was estimated using the cross-correlation function between the positions of background SMGs and foreground lens samples. Stacking techniques were employed to enhance the signal at smaller angular separations, and the more precise positions from the WISE catalogue were utilised to improve positional accuracy. The cross-correlation measurements revealed distinctive central excess and outer power-law profiles, with a lack of signal in the intermediate region. The analysis of mass density profiles indicated limitations in the selected profiles' ability to explain the observed data, highlighting the need for additional considerations. The results suggest the presence of isolated galactic halos and the importance of considering environmental factors and close satellites in future investigations. The derived masses and best-fit parameters contribute to our understanding of lensing systems and provide constraints on the nature of central galaxies. Notably, the intriguing lack of signal around 10 arcsec challenges current understanding and calls for further quantitative analysis and confirmation of the observed feature.</description>

      <title>Emission Line Velocity, Metallicity and Extinction Maps of the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the properties of optical emission lines in multiple locations across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the Australian National University 2.3-metre telescope and the WiFeS integral field spectrograph. From these measurements we interpolate maps of the gas phase metallicity, extinction, Halpha radial velocity, and Halpha velocity dispersion across the LMC. The LMC metallicity maps show a complex structure that cannot be explained by a simple radial gradient. The bright HII region 30 Doradus stands out as a region of high extinction. The Halpha and HI gas radial velocities are mostly consistent except for a region to the south and east of the LMC centre. The Halpha velocity dispersion is almost always higher than the HI velocity dispersion, except in the region that shows the divergence in radial velocity, where the HI velocity dispersion is greater than the Halpha velocity dispersion. This suggests that the HI gas is diverging from the stellar radial velocity, perhaps as a result of inflow or outflow of HI gas. The study of dwarf galaxies like the LMC is important as they are the building blocks of larger galaxies like our own Milky Way. The maps provided in this work show details not accessible in the study of more distant dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The PSF Smoothing Effect on Concentration-Related Parameters of High Redshift Galaxies in HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive investigation of the PSF smoothing effect on the measurement of concentration-related parameters ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) of high redshift galaxies in the HST and JWST surveys. Our sample contains massive galaxies from the CANDELS/EGS survey (0 &lt; z &lt; 2), and the CEERS survey (1 &lt; z &lt; 3). The non-parametric concentration-related parameters ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) and the model-dependent parameters (n, Re) of these galaxies are derived from Statmorph and GALFIT, respectively. We try to evaluate the PSF smoothing effect by comparing the concentration-related parameters to the S\'{e}rsic index in both observations and mock images. We find that the concentration index is generally underestimated, especially for smaller galaxies with higher S\'{e}rsic index (eventually converging to the concentration index of the PSF). However, galaxies with lower S\'{e}rsic index ($n \leq 1$) or larger relative size are less affected by the PSF smoothing effect. The Gini coefficient and the absolute $M_{20}$ statistic also show similar behaviour as the concentration index. Caution should be taken for the possible correction of the concentration-related parameters, where both the relative size and the S\'{e}rsic index of the galaxy are important. Compared to the HST images, the PSF smoothing is much less severe for images in the CEERS survey due to the much higher spatial resolution. In fact, it is better to use the S\'{e}rsic index rather than the non-parametric morphology indicators to trace the light concentration for galaxies at high redshifts. From the single S\'{e}rsic modelling of the HST and JWST images, we also confirm that galaxies at higher redshift are more compact with smaller $R_e$. The lower mass galaxies are more disc-like ($n\sim1$) compared to the higher mass galaxies that are more spheroid dominated ($n\sim3$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing, a compelling physical phenomenon, offers a unique avenue to investigate the morphology and physical properties of distant and faint celestial objects. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of observations concerning strongly lensed Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies. Emphasis is placed on the pivotal role played by cutting-edge facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array Observatory. These advanced instruments, operating at disparate ends of the electromagnetic spectrum, in conjunction with the amplifying effect of gravitational lensing, promise significant steps in our understanding of these sources. The synergy between these observatories operating at two opposite ends of the spectrum, is poised to unlock crucial insights into the evolutionary path of high-redshift, dust-obscured systems and unravel the intricate interplay between Active Galactic Nuclei and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE view of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used VLT/SPHERE to observe 20 systems in the Cha I cloud in polarized scattered light in the near-infrared. We combined the scattered light observations with existing literature data on stellar properties and with archival ALMA continuum data to study trends with system age and dust mass. We also connected resolved near-infrared observations with the spectral energy distributions of the systems. In 13 of the 20 systems included in this study we detected resolved scattered light signals from circumstellar dust. For the CR Cha, CT Cha, CV Cha, SY Cha, SZ Cha, and VZ Cha systems we present the first detailed descriptions of the disks in scattered light. The observations found typically smooth or faint disks, often with little substructure, with the notable exceptions of SZ Cha, which shows an extended multiple-ringed disk, and WW Cha, which shows interaction with the cloud environment. New high S/N K- band observations of the HD 97048 system in our survey reveal a significant brightness asymmetry that may point to disk misalignment and subsequent shadowing of outer disk regions, possibly related to the suggested planet candidate in the disk. We resolve for the first time the stellar binary in the CS Cha system. Multiple wavelength observations of the disk around CS Cha have revealed that the system contains small, compact dust grains that may be strongly settled, consistent with numerical studies of circumbinary disks. We find in our sample that there is a strong anti-correlation between the presence of a (close) stellar companion and the detection of circumstellar material with five of our seven nondetections located in binary systems.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE view of the Taurus star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sample of planet-forming disks observed by high-contrast imaging campaigns over the last decade is mature enough to enable the demographical analysis of individual star-forming regions. We present the full census of Taurus sources with VLT/SPHERE polarimetric images available. The whole sample sums up to 43 targets (of which 31 have not been previously published) corresponding to one-fifth of the Class II population in Taurus and about half of such objects that are observable. A large fraction of the sample is apparently made up of isolated faint disks (equally divided between small and large self-shadowed disks). Ambient signal is visible in about one-third of the sample. This probes the interaction with the environment and with companions or the outflow activity of the system. The central portion of the Taurus region almost exclusively hosts faint disks, while the periphery also hosts bright disks interacting with their surroundings. The few bright disks are found around apparently older stars. The overall picture is that the Taurus region is in an early evolutionary stage of planet formation. Yet, some objects are discussed individually, as in an intermediate or exceptional stage of the disk evolution. This census provides a first benchmark for the comparison of the disk populations in different star forming regions.</description>

      <title>The GUAPOS project. V: The chemical ingredients of a massive stellar protocluster in the making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars, including the Sun, are born in rich stellar clusters containing massive stars. Therefore, the study of the chemical reservoir of massive star-forming regions is crucial to understand the basic chemical ingredients available at the dawn of planetary systems. We present a detailed study of the molecular inventory of the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 from the project GUAPOS (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We analyze 34 species for the first time plus 20 species analyzed in previous GUAPOS works, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine species. We compare the abundances derived in G31.41+0.31 with those observed in other chemically-rich sources that represent the initial and last stages of the formation of stars and planets: the hot corino in the Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B, and the comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 46P/Wirtanen. The comparative analysis reveals that the chemical feedstock of the two star-forming regions are similar. The abundances of oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules exhibit a good correlation for all pair of sources, including the two comets, suggesting a chemical heritage of these species during the process of star formation, and hence an early phase formation of the molecules. However, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing species present worse correlations, being more abundant in comets. This suggests that while sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing species are predominantly trapped on the surface of icy grains in the hot close surroundings of protostars, they could be more easily released into gas phase in comets, allowing their cosmic abundances to be almost recovered.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of an Infrared-luminous, Broad-line Little Red Dot with an Ionized Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing the Circum-Galactic Medium with Fast Radio Bursts: Insights from the CAMELS Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem, and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics in Machine Learning (CAMEL) Simulations, using three suites: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying 6 parameters (2 cosmological &amp; 4 astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites, owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons, reducing the sightline-to-sightline variance in DMs between z=0-1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive AGN feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of renormalization group improved gravity from the kinematics of SPARC galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR) proposes a logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling $\left(G\right)$, resulting in a modified description of gravity. This has the potential to explain the observed kinematics of the galaxies, including the missing-mass problem. We, for the first time, based on the galaxy morphological types, investigate the dynamics of a diverse collection of galaxies present in the Spitzer Photometry for Accurate Rotation Curve (SPARC) catalog. We phenomenologically constrain the RGGR model parameter $\left(\bar\nu\right)$ along with the mass-to-light ratio for a sample of 100 SPARC galaxies, selected from four different morphological types, viz. early, spiral, late, and starburst. Our statistical analysis finds RGGR to fit the observed galaxy kinematics consistently. The constrained RGGR model parameter also supports the claim that it has a near-linear dependence on the galactic baryonic mass. From our morphology study, we find that the parameter $\bar\nu$ decreases from the early-type to the starburst galaxies. Finally, the renormalization group improved gravity is tested against the two established empirical relations for the SPARC catalog, viz., the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR), both are found to be satisfied consistently.</description>

      <title>VisRec: A Semi-Supervised Approach to Radio Interferometric Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio telescopes produce visibility data about celestial objects, but these data are sparse and noisy. As a result, images created on raw visibility data are of low quality. Recent studies have used deep learning models to reconstruct visibility data to get cleaner images. However, these methods rely on a substantial amount of labeled training data, which requires significant labeling effort from radio astronomers. Addressing this challenge, we propose VisRec, a model-agnostic semi-supervised learning approach to the reconstruction of visibility data. Specifically, VisRec consists of both a supervised learning module and an unsupervised learning module. In the supervised learning module, we introduce a set of data augmentation functions to produce diverse training examples. In comparison, the unsupervised learning module in VisRec augments unlabeled data and uses reconstructions from non-augmented visibility data as pseudo-labels for training. This hybrid approach allows VisRec to effectively leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. This way, VisRec performs well even when labeled data is scarce. Our evaluation results show that VisRec outperforms all baseline methods in reconstruction quality, robustness against common observation perturbation, and generalizability to different telescope configurations.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Resolving the Hot and Ionized Universe through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An omnipresent feature of the multi-phase ``cosmic web'' is that warm/hot (&gt;$10^5$ K) ionized gas pervades it. This gas constitutes a relevant contribution to the overall universal matter budget across multiple scales, from the several tens of Mpc-scale IGM filaments, to the Mpc ICM, all the way down to the CGM surrounding individual galaxies, on scales from ~1 kpc up to their respective virial radii (~100 kpc). The study of the hot baryonic component of cosmic matter density represents a powerful means for constraining the intertwined evolution of galactic populations and large-scale cosmological structures, for tracing the matter assembly in the Universe and its thermal history. To this end, the SZ effect provides the ideal observational tool for measurements out to the beginnings of structure formation. The SZ effect is caused by the scattering of the photons from the cosmic microwave background off the hot electrons embedded within cosmic structures, and provides a redshift-independent perspective on the thermal and kinematic properties of the warm/hot gas. Still, current and future (sub)mm facilities have been providing only a partial view of the SZ Universe due to any combination of: limited angular resolution, spectral coverage, field of view, spatial dynamic range, sensitivity. In this paper, we motivate the development of a wide-field, broad-band, multi-chroic continuum instrument for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) by identifying the scientific drivers that will deepen our understanding of the complex thermal evolution of cosmic structures. On a technical side, this will necessarily require efficient multi-wavelength mapping of the SZ signal with an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (from arcsecond to degree scales) and we employ theoretical forecasts to determine the key instrumental constraints for achieving our goals.

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim$ 20 such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Advancing parabolic operators in thermodynamic MHD models II: Evaluating a Practical Time Step Limit for Unconditionally Stable Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconditionally stable time stepping schemes are useful and often practically necessary for advancing parabolic operators in multi-scale systems. However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the phase space structure along pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations in a 3D galactic bar potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the phase space structure of a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system evolves across a series of successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations, as the transition of the parent families of periodic orbits (POs) from stability to simple instability leads to the creation of new stable POs. Our research illustrates the consecutive alterations in the phase space structure near POs as the stability of the main family of POs changes. This process gives rise to new families of POs within the system, either maintaining the same or exhibiting higher multiplicity compared to their parent families. Tracking such a phase space transformation is challenging in a 3D system. By utilizing the color and rotation technique to visualize the 4D Poincar'e surfaces of section of the system, i.e. projecting them onto a 3D subspace and employing color to represent the fourth dimension, we can identify distinct structural patterns. Perturbations of parent and bifurcating stable POs result in the creation of tori characterized by a smooth color variation on their surface. Furthermore, perturbations of simple unstable parent POs beyond the bifurcation point which lead to the birth of new stable families of POs, result in the formation of figure-8 structures of smooth color variations. These figure-8 formations surround well-shaped tori around the bifurcated stable POs, losing their well-defined forms for energies further away from the bifurcation point. We also observe that even slight perturbations of highly unstable POs create a cloud of mixed color points, which rapidly move away from the location of the PO. Our study introduces, for the first time, a systematic visualization of 4D surfaces of section within the vicinity of higher multiplicity POs. It elucidates how, in these cases, the coexistence of regular and chaotic orbits contributes to shaping the phase space landscape.</description>

      <title>The origin of lopsided satellite galaxy distribution around isolated systems in MillenniumTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf satellites in galaxy groups are distributed in an anisotropic and asymmetric manner, which is called the ``lopsided satellite distribution''. This lopsided signal has been observed not only in galaxy pairs but also in isolated systems. However, the physical origin of the lopsided signal in isolated systems is still unknown. In this work, we investigate this in the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation of the MillenniumTNG Project by tracing each system back to high redshift. We find that the lopsided signal is dominated by satellites located in the outer regions of the halo and is also dominated by recently accreted satellites. The lopsided signal originates from the anisotropic accretion of galaxies from the surrounding large-scale structure and that, after accretion, the nonlinear evolution of satellites inside the dark-matter halo weakens the lopsidedness. The signal decreases as cosmic time passes because of a competition between anisotropic accretion and internal evolution within dark matter halos. Our findings provide a useful perspective for the study of galaxy evolution, especially for the origin of the spatial satellite galaxy distributions.</description>

      <title>PI-AstroDeconv: A Physics-Informed Unsupervised Learning Method for Astronomical Image Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the imaging process of an astronomical telescope, the deconvolution of its beam or Point Spread Function (PSF) is a crucial task. However, deconvolution presents a classical and challenging inverse computation problem. In scenarios where the beam or PSF is complex or inaccurately measured, such as in interferometric arrays and certain radio telescopes, the resultant blurry images are often challenging to interpret visually or analyze using traditional physical detection methods. We argue that traditional methods frequently lack specific prior knowledge, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue and achieve image deconvolution and reconstruction, we propose an unsupervised network architecture that incorporates prior physical information. The network adopts an encoder-decoder structure while leveraging the telescope's PSF as prior knowledge. During network training, we introduced accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) convolution to enable efficient processing of high-resolution input images and PSFs. We explored various classic regression networks, including autoencoder (AE) and U-Net, and conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation through comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>Radio AGN jet alignment: Radio and Optical Position Angle of Radio Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that AGNs play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. These AGNs can be linked to the accretion processes onto massive black holes and past merger events in their host galaxies, which may lead to different alignments of the jets with respect to the host galaxies. This paper presents a study of the PA differences between radio and optical images of radio AGNs based on the LoTSS DR2, the FIRST, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and the SDSS. We assessed PA measurement biases in the data and classified the radio AGNs based on the radio luminosity and infrared colour from the WISE. This resulted in the largest yet published sample of 3682 radio AGNs with reliable radio and optical PA measurements. The PA difference (dPA) distributions for the radio AGN sample show a prominent minor-axis alignment tendency. Based on some simple assumptions, we simulated the projection effect to estimate the intrinsic jet-galaxy alignment. The observed dPA distribution can be well described by a two-component jet-alignment model in which one component is more aligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy than the other. The fitting results indicate that the jet alignment is dependent on radio luminosity and the shape of the host galaxies, with the jets being more likely to be aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy for lower radio luminosity and for optically more elongated radio AGNs. The minor-axis alignment of the entire sample may suggest a coherent accretion model present in most AGN host galaxies, while a considerable number of luminous radio-AGN with massive host galaxies might have undergone an accretion according to the chaotic model or past merger events.</description>

Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from \citet{suz16} with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. %This result suggests that planets are uniformly distributed in the Galaxy and more massive stars are more likely to possess planets. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

      <title>Lithium Abundances from the LAMOST Med-Resolution Survey Data Release 9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium is a fragile but crucial chemical element in the universe, exhibits interesting and complex behaviors. Thanks to the massive spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey (MRS), we can investigate the lithium abundances in a large and diverse sample of stars, which could bring vital help to study the origin and evolution of lithium. In this work, we use the Li 6,707.8 {\AA} line to derive the lithium abundance through a template-matching method. A catalog of precise lithium abundance is presented for 795,384 spectra corresponding to 455,752 stars from the LAMOST MRS Data Release (DR) 9. Comparing our results with those of external high-resolution references we find a good consistency with a typical deviation of {\sigma} A(Li) ~ 0.2 dex. We also analyze the internal errors using stars that have multiple LAMOST MRS observations, which will reach as low as 0.1 dex when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra &gt; 20. Besides, our result indicates that a small fraction of giant stars still exhibit surprisingly high amount of lithium contents, and 967 stars are identified as Li-rich giants with A(Li) &gt; 1.5 dex, accounting for ~ 2.6% of our samples. If one takes into account the fact that nearly all stars deplete lithium during the main sequence, then the fraction of Li-rich stars may exceed 2.6% much. This new catalog covers a wide range of stellar evolutionary stages from pre-main sequence to giants, and will provide help to the further study of the chemical evolution of lithium.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T Tauri stars with UVIT/AstroSat: probing accretion process in young stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;8500$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTS show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTS show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.21$\pm$0.17 and intercept of 2.18$\pm$0.56.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization measurement of the gold standard of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei : NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to measure, for the first time, the 2-8 keV polarization of NGC 1068. We pointed IXPE for a net exposure time of 1.15 Ms on the target, in addition to two ~ 10 ks each Chandra snapshots in order to account for the potential impact of several ultraluminous X-ray source (ULXs) within IXPE's field-of-view. We measured a 2 - 8 keV polarization degree of 12.4% +/- 3.6% and an electric vector polarization angle of 101{\deg} +/- 8{\deg} at 68% confidence level. If we exclude the spectral region containing the bright Fe K lines and other soft X-ray lines where depolarization occurs, the polarization fraction rises up to 21.3% +/- 6.7% in the 3.5 - 6.0 keV band, with a similar polarization angle. The observed polarization angle is found to be perpendicular to the parsec scale radio jet. Using a combined Chandra and IXPE analysis plus multi-wavelength constraints, we estimated that the circumnuclear "torus" may sustain a half-opening angle of 50{\deg} - 55{\deg} (from the vertical axis of the system). Thanks to IXPE, we have measured the X-ray polarization of NGC 1068 and found comparable results, both in terms of polarization angle orientation with respect to the radio-jet and torus half-opening angle, to the X-ray polarimetric measurement achieved for the other archetypal Compton-thick AGN : the Circinus galaxy. Probing the geometric arrangement of parsec-scale matter in extragalactic object is now feasible thanks to X-ray polarimetry.</description>

      <title>The radial orbits of ram-pressure-stripped galaxies in clusters from the GASP survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a sample of 244 ram-pressure-stripped candidate galaxy members within the virial radius of 62 nearby clusters, to determine their velocity anisotropy profile $\beta(r)$. We use previously determined mass profiles for the 62 clusters to build an ensemble cluster by stacking the 62 cluster samples in projected phase-space. We solve the Jeans equation for dynamical equilibrium by two methods, MAMPOSSt and the Jeans inversion technique, and determine $\beta(r)$ both in parametric form and non-parametrically. The two methods consistently indicate that the orbits of the ram-pressure-stripped candidates are increasingly radial with distance from the cluster center, from almost isotropic ($\beta \simeq 0$) at the center, to very radial at the virial radius ($\beta \simeq 0.7$). The orbits of cluster galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping are similar to those of spiral cluster galaxies, but more radially elongated at large radii.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE view of the Orion star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SPHERE/IRDIS H-band data for a sample of 23 stars in the Orion Star forming region observed within the DESTINYS (Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars) program. We use polarization differential imaging in order to detect scattered light from circumstellar dust. From the scattered light observations we characterize the disk orientation, radius and contrast. We analyse the disks in context of the stellar parameters and the environment of the Orion star-forming region. We use ancillary X-shooter spectroscopic observations to characterize the central stars in the systems. We furthermore use a combination of new and archival ALMA mm-continuum observations to characterize the dust masses present in the circumstellar disks. Within our sample we detect extended circumstellar disks in 10 of 23 systems. Of these, three are exceptionally extended (V351 Ori, V599 Ori and V1012 Ori) and show scattered light asymmetries which may indicate perturbations by embedded planets or (in the case of V599 Ori) by an outer stellar companion. Our high resolution imaging observations are also sensitive to close (sub)stellar companions and we detect 9 such objects in our sample of which 5 were previously unknown. We find in particular a possible sub-stellar companion (either a very low mass star or a high mass brown dwarf) 137 au from the star RY Ori. We find a strong anti-correlation between disk detection and multiplicity, with only 2 of our 10 disk detections located in stellar multiple systems. We also find a correlation between scattered light contrast and the millimetre flux suggesting that disks that have a high dust content are typically bright in near-infrared scattered light. Conversely we do not find significant correlations between scattered light contrast of the disks and the stellar mass or age.</description>

      <title>Morphological Parameters and Associated Uncertainties for 8 Million Galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Wide Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters and associated uncertainties for $\sim 8$ million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide survey with $z \leq 0.75$ and $m \leq 23$. GaMPEN is a machine learning framework that estimates Bayesian posteriors for a galaxy's bulge-to-total light ratio ($L_B/L_T$), effective radius ($R_e$), and flux ($F$). By first training on simulations of galaxies and then applying transfer learning using real data, we trained GaMPEN with $&lt;1\%$ of our dataset. This two-step process will be critical for applying machine learning algorithms to future large imaging surveys, such as the Rubin-Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), and Euclid. By comparing our results to those obtained using light-profile fitting, we demonstrate that GaMPEN's predicted posterior distributions are well-calibrated ($\lesssim 5\%$ deviation) and accurate. This represents a significant improvement over light profile fitting algorithms which underestimate uncertainties by as much as $\sim60\%$. For an overlapping sub-sample, we also compare the derived morphological parameters with values in two external catalogs and find that the results agree within the limits of uncertainties predicted by GaMPEN. This step also permits us to define an empirical relationship between the S\'ersic index and $L_B/L_T$ that can be used to convert between these two parameters. The catalog presented here represents a significant improvement in size ($\sim10 \times $), depth ($\sim4$ magnitudes), and uncertainty quantification over previous state-of-the-art bulge+disk decomposition catalogs. With this work, we also release GaMPEN's source code and trained models, which can be adapted to other datasets.</description>

      <title>TRINITY III: Quasar Luminosity Functions Decomposed by Halo, Galaxy, and Black Hole Masses and Eddington Ratios from z=0-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the redshift evolution of quasar luminosity functions decomposed by halo mass, galaxy mass, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, and Eddington ratio, as well as SMBH kinetic/radiative energy output ratios from TRINITY, a flexible empirical model that self-consistently infers the halo--galaxy--SMBH connection that match observational data. Key findings include: 1) The normalization of QLF increases by ~3-4 dex from z~10 to z~4, due to the fast mass build-up of different SMBH populations; 2) From z~4 to z~1, less massive galaxies and SMBHs make up bigger and bigger fractions of QLFs, due to the AGN downsizing effect; 3) At z~0, massive haloes/galaxies/SMBHs are responsible for most bright quasars due to low Eddington ratios among all SMBHs; 4) The bright ends of quasar luminosity functions (QLFs) are dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex over-massive relative to the median SMBH mass-galaxy mass relation; 5) QLFs at z~6-7 are dominated by SMBHs accreting at Eddington ratios 0.1 &lt; $\eta_\mathrm{rad}$ &lt; 1, but super-Eddington AGNs contribute more significantly to QLFs towards z~9-10.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Sands II: Challenges in Predicting and Measuring High-z Dust Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current era of high-z galaxy discovery with JWST and ALMA, our ability to study the stellar populations and ISM conditions in a diverse range of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn has rapidly improved. At the same time, the need to understand the current limitations in modeling galaxy formation processes and physical properties in order to interpret these observations is critical. Here, we study the challenges in modeling galaxy dust temperatures, both in the context of forward modeling galaxy spectral properties from a hydrodynamical simulation and via backwards modeling galaxy physical properties from mock observations of far-infrared dust emission. Using the Simba model for galaxy formation combined with Powderday radiative transfer, we can accurately predict the evolution of dust at high redshift, though several aspects of the model are essentially free parameters (dust composition, sub-resolution dust in star-forming regions) that dull the predictive power of the model dust temperature distributions. We also highlight the uncertainties in the backwards modeling methods, where we find the commonly used models and assumptions to fit FIR SEDs and infer dust temperatures (e.g., single temperature, optically thin modified blackbody) largely fail to capture the complexity of high-z dusty galaxies. We caution that conclusions inferred from both simulations -- limited by resolution and post-processing techniques -- and observations -- limited by sparse data and simplistic model parameterizations -- are susceptible to unique and nuanced uncertainties that can limit the usefulness of current high-z dust measurements.</description>

      <title>ReveaLLAGN 0: First Look at JWST MIRI data of Sombrero and NGC 1052</title>

Abstract: We present the first results from the Revealing Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (ReveaLLAGN) survey, a JWST survey of seven nearby LLAGN. We focus on two observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the nuclei of NGC 1052 and Sombrero (NGC 4594 / M104). We also compare these data to public JWST data of a higher-luminosity AGN, NGC 7319 and NGC 7469. JWST clearly separates the AGN spectrum from the galaxy light even in Sombrero, the faintest target in our survey; the AGN components have very red spectra. We find that the emission-line widths in both NGC 1052 and Sombrero increase with increasing ionization potential, with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s for lines with ionization potential &gt; 50 eV. These lines are also significantly blue-shifted in both LLAGN. The high ionization potential lines in NGC 7319 show neither broad widths or significant blue shifts. Many of the lower ionization potential emission lines in Sombrero show significant blue wings extending &gt; 1000 km/s. These features and the emission-line maps in both galaxies are consistent with outflows along the jet direction. Sombrero has the lowest luminosity high-ionization potential lines ([Ne V] and [O IV]) ever measured in the mid-IR, but the relative strengths of these lines are consistent with higher luminosity AGN. On the other hand, the [Ne V] emission is much weaker relative to the [Ne III] and [Ne II] lines of higher-luminosity AGN. These initial results show the great promise that JWST holds for identifying and studying the physical nature of LLAGN.</description>

      <title>[CII] Emission in a Self-Regulated Interstellar Medium</title>

Abstract: The [CII] 157.74 $\mu$m fine structure transition is one of the brightest and most well-studied emission lines in the far-infrared (FIR), produced in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. We study its properties in sub-pc resolution hydrodynamical simulations for an ISM patch with gas surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm{g}}=10\;M_{\odot}\;\rm{pc}^{-2}$, coupled with time-dependent chemistry, far-ultraviolet (FUV) dust and gas shielding, star formation, photoionization and supernova (SN) feedback, and full line-radiative transfer. We find a [CII]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor that scales weakly with metallicity $X_{\rm{[CII]}}=6.31\times 10^{19} \;Z^{\prime\;0.17}\; \rm{cm}^{-2}\;(\rm{K}\;\rm{km}\;\rm{s}^{-1})^{-1}$, where $Z^{\prime}$ is the normalized metallicity relative to solar. {The majority of [CII] originates from atomic gas with hydrogen number density $n\sim 10~{\rm cm^{-3}}$.} The [CII] line intensity positively correlates with the star formation rate (SFR), with a normalization factor that scales linearly with metallicity. We find that this is broadly consistent with $z\sim0$ observations. As such, [CII] is a good SFR tracer even in metal-poor environments where molecular lines might be undetectable. Resolving the clumpy structure of the dense ($n=10-10^3\;\rm{cm}^{-3}$) interstellar medium (ISM) is important as it dominates [CII] 157.74 $\mu$m emission. We compare our full radiative transfer computation with the optically-thin limit and find that the [CII] line becomes marginally optically thick only at super-solar metallicity for our assumed gas surface density.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Galactic disk with the LAMOST and Gaia Red clump sample: VIII: Mapping the kinematics of the Galactic disk using mono-age and mono-abundance stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 $\leq$ R $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions, such as the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north-south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial-dependences of those bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and, a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as the disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., $R \ge 12$ kpc) mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[$\alpha$/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/$\alpha$-poor populations are likely originated from dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/$\alpha$-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Comparing emission- and absorption-based gas-phase metallicities in GRB host galaxies at $z=2-4$ using JWST</title>

Abstract: Much of what is known of the chemical composition of the universe is based on emission line spectra from star forming galaxies. Emission-based inferences are, nevertheless, model-dependent and they are dominated by light from luminous star forming regions. An alternative and sensitive probe of the metallicity of galaxies is through absorption lines imprinted on the luminous afterglow spectra of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) from neutral material within their host galaxy. We present results from a JWST/NIRSpec programme to investigate for the first time the relation between the metallicity of neutral gas probed in absorption by GRB afterglows and the metallicity of the star forming regions for the same host galaxy sample. Using an initial sample of eight GRB host galaxies at z=2.1-4.7, we find a tight relation between absorption and emission line metallicities when using the recently proposed $\hat{R}$ metallicity diagnostic (+/-0.2dex). This agreement implies a relatively chemically-homogeneous multi-phase interstellar medium, and indicates that absorption and emission line probes can be directly compared. However, the relation is less clear when using other diagnostics, such as R23 and R3. We also find possible evidence of an elevated N/O ratio in the host galaxy of GRB090323 at z=4.7, consistent with what has been seen in other $z&gt;4$ galaxies. Ultimate confirmation of an enhanced N/O ratio and of the relation between absorption and emission line metallicities will require a more direct determination of the emission line metallicity via the detection of temperature-sensitive auroral lines in our GRB host galaxy sample.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe remains a topic of profound interest and debate. In this paper, we investigate the formation and growth of the first SMBHs within the framework of Modified Gravity (MOG), where gravity exhibits increased strength. We explore how MOG, as an alternative to the standard model, may offer novel insights into the emergence of SMBHs and potentially reconcile the discrepancies observed in the accretion and growth processes. We examine the dynamics of gas and matter in this modified gravitational framework, shedding light on the unique interplay between gravity and the formation of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: a new constraint on galaxy formation models using the observed colour redshift relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model implemented in the Planck Millennium N-body simulation to build a mock galaxy catalogue on an observer's past lightcone. The mass resolution of this N-body simulation is almost an order of magnitude better than in previous simulations used for this purpose, allowing us to probe fainter galaxies and hence build a more complete mock catalogue at low redshifts. The high time cadence of the simulation outputs allows us to make improved calculations of galaxy properties and positions in the mock. We test the predictions of the mock against the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey, a narrow band imaging survey with highly accurate and precise photometric redshifts, which probes the galaxy population over a lookback time of 8 billion years. We compare the model against the observed number counts, redshift distribution and evolution of the observed colours and find good agreement; these statistics avoid the need for model-dependent processing of the observations. The model produces red and blue populations that have similar median colours to the observations. However, the bimodality of galaxy colours in the model is stronger than in the observations. This bimodality is reduced on including a simple model for errors in the GALFORM photometry. We examine how the model predictions for the observed galaxy colours change when perturbing key model parameters. This exercise shows that the median colours and relative abundance of red and blue galaxies provide constraints on the strength of the feedback driven by supernovae used in the model.</description>

      <title>Clumpy star formation and an obscured nuclear starburst in the luminous dusty z=4 galaxy GN20 seen by MIRI/JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies emit most of their light at far-IR to mm wavelengths as their star formation is highly obscured. Far-IR and mm observations have revealed their dust, neutral and molecular gas properties. The sensitivity of JWST at rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths now allows the study of the stellar and ionized gas content. We investigate the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas in GN20, a dusty star forming galaxy at $z$=4.0548. We present deep MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy of the near-infrared rest-frame emission of GN20. We detect spatially resolved \paa, out to a radius of 6 kpc, distributed in a clumpy morphology. The star formation rate derived from \paa\ (144 $\pm$ 9 \msunperyear) is only 7.7 $\pm 0.5 $\% of the infrared star formation rate (1860 $\pm$ 90 \msunperyear). We attribute this to very high extinction (A$_V$ = 17.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mag, or A$_{V,mixed}$ = 44 $\pm$ 3 mag), especially in the nucleus of GN20, where only faint \paa\ is detected, suggesting a deeply buried starburst. We identify four, spatially unresolved, clumps in the \paa\ emission. Based on the double peaked \paa\ profile we find that each clump consist of at least two sub-clumps. We find mass upper limits consistent with them being formed in a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk. The UV bright region of GN20 does not have any detected \paa\ emission, suggesting an age of more than 10 Myrs for this region of the galaxy. From the rotation profile of \paa\ we conclude that the gas kinematics are rotationally dominated and the $v_{rot}/\sigma_{m} = 3.8 \pm 1.4$ is similar to low-redshift LIRGs. We speculate that the clumps seen in GN20 could contribute to building up the inner disk and bulge of GN20.</description>

      <title>Supernova environments in J-PLUS. Normalized Cumulative Rank distributions and stellar population synthesis, combining narrow- and broad-band filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local environmental properties of 418 supernovae (SNe) of all types using data from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), which includes 5 broad- and 7 narrow-band imaging filters, using two independent analyses: 1) the Normalized Cumulative Rank (NCR) method, utilizing all 12 single bands along with five continuum-subtracted narrow-band emission and absorption bands, and 2) simple stellar population (SSP) synthesis, where we build spectral energy distributions (SED) of the surrounding SN environment using the 12 filters. Improvements over previous works include: (i) the extension of the NCR technique to other filters using a set of homogeneous data; (ii) a correction for extinction to all bands based on the relation between the g-i color and the color excess; and (iii) a correction for the [NII] line contamination that falls within the H$\alpha$ filter. All NCR distributions in the broad-band filters, tracing the overall light distribution in each galaxy, are similar to each other, being type Ia, II and IIb SNe are preferably located in redder environments than the other SN types. The radial distribution of the SNe shows that type IIb SNe seem to have a preference for occurring in the inner regions of galaxies. All core-collapse SN (CC) types are strongly correlated to the [OII] emission, which traces SFR. The NCR distributions of the Ca II triplet show a clear division between II/IIb/Ia and Ib/Ic/IIn subtypes, which is interpreted as a difference in the environmental metallicity. Regarding the SSP synthesis, we found that including the 7 J-PLUS narrow filters in the fitting process has a more significant effect for the CC SN environmental parameters than for SNe Ia, shifting their values towards more extinct, younger, and more star-forming environments, due to the presence of strong emission-lines and stellar absorptions in those narrow-bands.</description>

      <title>The Redshift Evolution of the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ Relation for JWST's Supermassive Black Holes at $z &gt; 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at $z &gt; 4$, where the mass of the black hole, $M_\bullet$, is $10-100$ times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, $M_\star$. This Letter presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-$z$ Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-$z$ star formation quenching. SMBHs globally impact their high-$z$ galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at $z &gt; 4$. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio $M_\bullet/M_\star$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if $M_\bullet/M_\star &gt; 8\times 10^{18} (n \Lambda/f_{edd})[(\Omega_b M_h)/(\Omega_m M_\star) - 1]$, then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system towards the local $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation. Furthermore, the $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation evolves with redshift as $\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. At $z \sim 5$, we find an overmassive factor of $\sim 55$, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-$z$ relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Obscured star formation in clusters at z=1.6-2.0: massive galaxy formation and the reversal of the star formation-density relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies at z&gt;1 are expected to be increasingly active sites of star formation. To test this, an 850um survey was undertaken of eight high-redshift clusters at z=1.6-2.0 using SCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Mid-infrared properties were used to identify 53 probable counterparts to 45 SCUBA-2 sources with colours that suggested that they were cluster members. This uncovered a modest overdensity of 850um sources with far-infrared luminosities LIR&gt;10^12Lo (SFR&gt;100Mo/yr) and colours consistent with being cluster members of a factor of 4+/-1 within the central 1Mpc radius of the clusters. The submillimetre photometry of these galaxies was used to estimate the total cluster star formation rates. These showed that the mass-normalised rates in the clusters are two orders of magnitude higher than in local systems, evolving as (1+z)^(5.5+/-0.6). This rapid evolution means that the mass-normalised star formation rates in these clusters matched that of average halos in the field at z~1.8+/-0.2 marking the epoch where the local star formation-density relation reverses in massive halos. The estimated stellar masses of the cluster submillimetre galaxies suggest that their descendants will be amongst the most massive galaxies in z~0 clusters. This reinforces the suggestion that the majority of the massive early-type galaxy population in z~0 clusters were likely to have formed at z&gt;1.5-2 through very active, but dust-obscured, starburst events.</description>

      <title>Evidence of extended [CII] and dust emission in local dwarf galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of dwarf galaxies is dramatically affected by gaseous and dusty outflows, which can easily deprive their interstellar medium of the material needed for the formation of new stars, simultaneously enriching their surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this letter, we present the first evidence of extended [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and dust continuum emission in local dwarf galaxies hosting star-formation-driven outflows. By stacking the [CII], far-infrared, and near-UV (NUV) emission obtained from Herschel and GALEX data, we derived the average radial profiles, and compared the spatial extension of gas, dust, and stellar activity in dwarf galaxies. We find that [CII] and dust emissions are comparable to each other, and more extended than the NUV continuum. The [CII] size is in agreement with that measured for $z&gt;4$ star-forming galaxies, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be at the origin of the observed atomic carbon reservoir around local and high-$z$ sources. The cold dust follows the [CII] emission, going beyond the stellar continuum as opposed to what is typically observed in the early Universe where measurements can be affected by the poor sensitivity and faintness of dust emission in the CGM of high-$z$ galaxies. We attribute the extended [CII] and dust continuum emission to the presence of galactic outflows. As local dwarf galaxies are considered analogs of primordial sources, we expect that comparable feedback processes can be at the origin of the observed [CII] halos at $z&gt;4$, dominating over other possible formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Primordial Rotating Disk Composed of $\geq$15 Dense Star-Forming Clumps at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early galaxy formation, initiated by the dark matter and gas assembly, evolves through frequent mergers and feedback processes into dynamically hot, chaotic structures. In contrast, dynamically cold, smooth rotating disks have been observed in massive evolved galaxies merely 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang, suggesting rapid morphological and dynamical evolution in the early Universe. Probing this evolution mechanism necessitates studies of young galaxies, yet efforts have been hindered by observational limitations in both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we report high-resolution observations of a strongly lensed and quintuply imaged, low-luminosity, young galaxy at $z=6.072$ (dubbed the Cosmic Grapes), 930 million years after the Big Bang. Magnified by gravitational lensing, the galaxy is resolved into at least 15 individual star-forming clumps with effective radii of $r_{\rm e}\simeq$ 10--60 parsec (pc), which dominate $\simeq$ 70\% of the galaxy's total flux. The cool gas emission unveils a smooth, underlying rotating disk characterized by a high rotational-to-random motion ratio and a gravitationally unstable state (Toomre $Q \simeq$ 0.2--0.3), with high surface gas densities comparable to local dusty starbursts with $\simeq10^{3-5}$ $M_{\odot}$/pc$^{2}$. These gas properties suggest that the numerous star-forming clumps are formed through disk instabilities with weak feedback effects. The clumpiness of the Cosmic Grapes significantly exceeds that of galaxies at later epochs and the predictions from current simulations for early galaxies. Our findings shed new light on internal galaxy substructures and their relation to the underlying dynamics and feedback mechanisms at play during their early formation phases, potentially explaining the high abundance of bright galaxies observed in the early Universe and the dark matter core-cusp problem.</description>

Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

      <title>Small amplitude red giants elucidate the nature of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch as a standard candle</title>

Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is an important standard candle for determining luminosity distances. Although several $10^5$ small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) have been discovered, variability was previously considered irrelevant for the TRGB as a standard candle. Here, we show that all stars near the TRGB are SARGs that follow several period-luminosity sequences, of which sequence A is younger than sequence B as predicted by stellar evolution. We measure apparent TRGB magnitudes, m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Sobel filters applied to photometry from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the ESA Gaia mission, and we identify several weaknesses in a recent LMC-based TRGB calibration used to measure the Hubble constant. We consider four samples: all Red Giants (RGs), SARGs, and sequences A &amp; B. The B-sequence is best suited for measuring distances to old RG populations, with M$_{\mathrm{F814W,0}}$ = -4.025 $\pm$ 0.014(stat.) $\pm$ 0.033(syst.) mag assuming the LMC's geometric distance. Control of systematics is demonstrated using detailed simulations. Population diversity affects m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ at a level exceeding the stated precision: the SARG and A-sequence samples yield 0.039 mag and 0.085 mag fainter (at 5{\sigma} significance) m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ values, respectively. Ensuring equivalent RG populations is crucial to measuring accurate TRGB distances. Additionally, luminosity function smoothing ($\sim$ 0.02 mag) and edge detection response weighting (as much as -0.06 mag) can further bias TRGB measurements, with the latter introducing a tip-contrast relation. We are optimistic that variable red giants will enable further improvements to the TRGB as a standard candle.</description>

      <title>Viscous torque in turbulent magnetized AGN accretion disks and its effects on EMRI's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) produces mHz gravitational waves (GW), which are potentially detectable by future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Such binary systems are usually embedded in an accretion disk environment at the centre of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Recent studies suggest the plasma environment imposes measurable imprints on the GW signal if the mass ratio of the binary is around q $ \sim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. The effect of the gaseous environment on the GW signal is strongly dependent on the disk's parameters, therefore it is believed that future low-frequency GW detections will provide us with precious information about the physics of AGN accretion disks. We investigate this effect by measuring the viscous torque via modelling the evolution of magnetized tori around the primary massive black hole. Using GRMHD HARM-COOL code, we perform 2D and 3D simulations of weakly-magnetized thin accretion disks, with a possible truncation and transition to advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We study the angular momentum transport and turbulence generated by magnetorotational instability (MRI). We quantify the disk's effective alpha viscosity and its evolution over time. We apply our numerical results to quantify the relativistic viscous torque on a hypothetical low-mass secondary black hole via a 1D analytical approach, and we estimate the GW phase shift due to the gas environment.</description>

      <title>Discovery of A New Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator in the SkyMapper DR2: SMSS J184506.82-300804.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator, SMSS J184506-300804 (SMSS-BLAP-1) in Data Release 2 of the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey. We conduct high-cadence photometric observations in the $u$ band to confirm a periodic modulation of the lightcurve. SMSS-BLAP-1 has a ~19-min pulsation period with an amplitude of 0.2 mag in $u$ band, and is similar to the classical BLAPs found by OGLE. From spectroscopic observations with the Wide-Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope, we confirm it as a low-gravity BLAP: best-fit parameters from the non-LTE Tlusty model are estimated as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 29,020$^{+193}_{-34}$ K, $\log g$ = 4.661$^{+0.008}_{-0.143}$ (cm s$^{-2}$), and $\log$ n(He)/n(H) = -2.722$^{+0.057}_{-0.074}$ dex. However, our BLAP exhibits a very He-deficient atmosphere compared to both low- and high-gravity BLAPs, which have $\log$ n(He)/n(H) in the range -0.41~-2.4.</description>

      <title>Holographic Inflation, Primordial Black Holes and Early Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence has accumulated that there are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of most galaxies, and that these were formed in the very early universe by some as yet unknown process. In particular, there is evidence [15] that at least some galaxies formed as early as $10^8$ to $10^9$ years after the Big Bang host SMBHs. We suggest that the holographic model of inflation, whose dark matter candidates are primordial black holes carrying a discrete gauge charge, which originated as a small subset of the inflationary horizon volumes in the very early universe, can provide the seeds for this early structure formation. Aspects of the model pointed out long ago suggested an early era of structure formation, with structures dominated by dark matter. The additional assumption that the dark matter consists of discretely charged black holes implies black hole dominance of early structures, which seems to be implied by JWST data.</description>
