      <title>Solving the Gibbs Problem with Algebraic Projective Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbit determination (OD) from three position vectors is one of the classical problems in astrodynamics. Early contributions to this problem were made by J. Willard Gibbs in the late 1800s and OD of this type is known today as ``Gibbs Problem''. There are a variety of popular solutions to the Gibbs problem. While some authors solve for the orbital elements directly, most contemporary discussions are based on a vector analysis approach inspired by Gibbs himself.
  This work presents a completely different solution to those just described. Although there is nothing wrong with the vector analysis approach, some interesting insights may be gained by considering the problem from the perspective of algebraic projective geometry. Such an algebraic solution is presented here. The OD procedure is based upon a novel and geometrically meaningful solution to the algebraic fitting of an ellipse with a focus at the origin using only three points. Although the final OD result is identical to the classical vector analysis approach pioneered by Gibbs, this new algebraic solution is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Higher codimension nef and effective cycles on the Hilbert scheme of 3 points in projective 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nef and effective cones of divisors have been the subject of much study. In contrast, their higher codimension analogues are much harder to compute and few examples exist in the literature. In this paper we compute the nef cones in codimensions 2 &amp; 3 and the effective cones in dimensions 2 &amp; 3 for the Hilbert scheme of three points in $\mathbb{P}^3$. Our computation generalizes results of Ryan &amp; Stathis and requires a careful analysis of the PGL orbits in the Hilbert scheme, as well as a new basis of the Chow ring inspired by Mallavibarrena and Sols.</description>

      <title>On the Intersection of Two Conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the intersection of two conics is a commonly occurring problem. For example, it occurs when identifying patterns of craters on the lunar surface, detecting the orientation of a face from a single image, or estimating the attitude of a camera from 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Regardless of the application, the study of this classical problem presents a number of delightful geometric results.
  In most of the cases, the intersection points are computed by finding the degenerate conic consisting of two lines passing through the common points. Once a linear combination of the two conic matrices has been constructed, the solution of an eigenvalue problem provides four possible degenerate conics, of which only one coincides with the sought pair of lines. Then, the method proceeds by finding the intersection between one of the conics and the two lines. Other approaches make use of different methods, such as Gr\"obner bases or geometric algebra.
  Conic intersection, however, may be solved more intuitively with a convenient change of coordinates. In this work, we will consider two such coordinate changes. In the first approach, one of the conics is transformed into a parabola, which reduces the intersection problem to finding the solution of a quartic. In the second approach, we instead use the concept of self-polar triangles - which, amazingly, reduces the conic intersection problem to the solution of a simple quadratic equation.</description>

      <title>Spherical amoebae and a spherical logarithm map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ with a maximal compact subgroup $K$. Let $G/H$ be a (quasi-affine) spherical homogeneous space. In the first part of the paper, following Akhiezer's definition of spherical functions, we introduce a $K$-invariant map $sLog_{\Gamma, t}: G/H \to \mathbb{R}^s$ which depends on a choice of a finite set $\Gamma$ of dominant weights and $s = |\Gamma|$. We call $sLog_{\Gamma, t}$ a spherical logarithm map. We show that when $\Gamma$ generates the highest weight monoid of $G/H$, the image of the spherical logarithm map parametrizes $K$-orbits in $G/H$. This idea of using the spherical functions to understand the geometry of the space $K \backslash G/H$ of $K$-orbits in $G/H$ can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Cartan decomposition. In the second part of the paper, we define the spherical amoeba (depending on $\Gamma$ and $t$) of a subvariety $Y$ of $G/H$ as $sLog_{\Gamma, t}(Y)$, and we ask for conditions under which the image of a subvariety $Y \subset G/H$ under $sLog_{\Gamma, t}$ converges, as $t \to 0$, in the sense of Kuratowski to its spherical tropicalization as defined by Tevelev and Vogiannou. We prove a partial result toward answering this question, which shows in particular that the valuation cone is always contained in the Kuratowski limit of the spherical amoebae of $G/H$. We also show that the limit of the spherical amoebae of $G/H$ is equal to its valuation cone in a number of interesting examples, including when $G/H$ is horospherical, and in the case when $G/H$ is the space of hyperbolic triangles.</description>

      <title>Reflexivity and Hochschild Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflexive DG-categories were defined by Kuznetsov and Shinder as generalisations of smooth and proper DG-categories. Over a perfect field, they include all projective schemes and finite dimensional algebras. Smooth and proper DG-categories are the dualizable objects in the symmetric monoidal category of DG-categories localised at Morita equivalences. We show the reflexive DG-categories are the reflexive objects in this monoidal category. Using this perspective we prove that the Hochschild cohomology of a reflexive DG-category is isomorphic to that of its derived category of cohomologically finite modules.</description>

      <title>Algebraic algorithms for vector bundles over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent vector bundles over a regular algebraic curve as pairs of lattices over the maximal orders of its function field and we give polynomial algorithms for several tasks: computing determinants of vector bundles, kernels and images of global homomorphisms, isomorphisms between vector bundles, cohomology groups, extensions, and splitting into a direct sum of indecomposables. Most algorithms are deterministic except for computing isomorphisms when the base field is infinite. Some algorithms are only polynomial if we may compute Hermite forms of pseudo-matrices in polynomial time. All algorithms rely exclusively on algebraic operations in function fields. For applications, we give an algorithm enumerating isomorphism classes of vector bundles on an elliptic curve, and to construct algebraic geometry codes over vector bundles. We implement all our algorithms into a SageMath package.</description>

Abstract: If the characteristic of a field $k$ is odd any infinitesimal group scheme of $PGL_{2,k}$ lifts to $SL_{2,k}$. In this paper, we prove that this is not true in characteristic $2$ and we give a complete description, up to isomorphism, of infinitesimal unipotent subgroup schemes of $PGL_{2,k}$. Also, the infinitesimal trigonalizable case is considered.</description>

      <title>The K-moduli space of a family of conic bundle threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the 6-dimensional compact K-moduli space of Fano threefolds in deformation family No 2.18. These Fano threefolds are double covers of $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^2$ branched along smooth $(2,2)$-surfaces, and Cheltsov--Fujita--Kishimoto--Park proved that any smooth Fano threefold in this family is K-stable. A member of family No 2.18 admits the structures of a conic bundle and a quadric surface bundle. We prove that K-polystable limits of these Fano threefolds admit conic bundle structures, but not necessarily del Pezzo fibration structures. We study this K-moduli space via the moduli space of log Fano pairs $(\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^2, c R)$ for $c=1/2$ and $R$ a $(2,2)$-divisor, which we construct using wall-crossings. In the case where the divisor is proportional to the anti-canonical divisor, the first author, together with Ascher and Liu, developed a framework for wall crossings in K-moduli and proved that there are only finitely many walls, which occur at rational values of the coefficient $c$. This paper constructs the first example of wall-crossing in K-moduli in the non-proportional setting, and we find a wall at an irrational value of $c$. In particular, we obtain explicit descriptions of the GIT and K-moduli spaces (for $c \leq 1/2$) of these $(2,2)$-divisors. Furthermore, using the conic bundle structure, we study the relationship with the GIT moduli space of plane quartic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture in positive characteristic holds for bounded-degree self-maps of projective varieties. The key ingredient of the proof is a Mordell-Lang-type result for arbitrary algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic, which is also interesting on its own. Moreover, we propose a geometric version of dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Pinched theorem and the reverse Yau's inequalities for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 2$, we explicitly write the expression $-c_1^n(M)+\frac{2(n+1)}{n}c_2(M)c_1^{n-2}(M)$ in the form of certain integral on the holomorphic sectional curvature and its average at a fixed point in $M$ using the invariant theory. As applications, we get a reverse Yau's inequality and improve the classical $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem and negative $\frac{1}{4}$-pinched theorem for compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds to smaller pinching constant depending only on the dimension and the first Chern class of $M$. If $M$ is not with positive or negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then there exists a point $x\in M$ such that the average of the holomorphic sectional curvature at $x$ vanishes. In particular, we characterise the $2$-dimensional complex torus by certain curvature condition. Moreover, we confirm Yau's conjecture for positive holomorphic sectional curvature and Siu-Yang's conjecture for negative holomorphic sectional curvature even for higher dimensions if the absolute value of the holomorphic sectional curvature is small enough. Finally, using the reverse Yau's inequality, we can judge if a projective manifold doesn't carry any hermitian metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize principal bundles and quotient stacks to the two-categorical context of bisites. We introduce a notion of principal 2-bundle that makes sense for a 2-category with finite flexible limits, endowed with a bitopology. We then use principal 2-bundles to explicitly construct quotient-pre-2-stacks, which are the analogues of quotient stacks one dimension higher. In order to perform this construction, we prove that principal 2-bundles are closed under iso-comma objects and we restrict ourselves to (2,1)-categories. Finally, we prove that, if the bisite is subcanonical and the underlying (2,1)-category satisfies some mild conditions, quotient pre-2-stacks are 2-stacks.</description>

      <title>Difference of solutions for the inversion problem of ultra-elliptic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 defined by $Y^2=f(X)$, where $f(X)$ is a polynomial of degree 5. The sigma function associated with $V$ is a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}^2$. For a point $P$ on $V$, we consider the problem to express the $X$-coordinate of $P$ in terms of the image of $P$ under the Abel-Jacobi map. Two meromorphic functions $f_2$ and $g_2$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ which give solutions of this problem are known. Since $f_2$ and $g_2$ coincide on the zero set of the sigma function, it is expected that $f_2-g_2$ can be divided by the sigma function. In this paper, we decompose $f_2-g_2$ into a product of the sigma function and a meromorphic function explicitly.</description>

      <title>Tree-Level Superstring Amplitudes: The Neveu-Schwarz Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete computation of superstring scattering amplitudes at tree level, for the case of Neveu-Schwarz insertions. Mathematically, this is to say that we determine explicitly the superstring measure on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,n,0}$ of super Riemann surfaces of genus zero with $n \ge 3$ Neveu-Schwarz punctures. While, of course, an expression for the measure was previously known, we do this from first principles, using the canonically defined super Mumford isomorphism. We thus determine the scattering amplitudes, explicitly in the global coordinates on $\mathcal{M}_{0,n,0}$, without the need for picture changing operators or ghosts, and are also able to determine canonically the value of the coupling constant. Our computation should be viewed as a step towards performing similar analysis on $\mathcal{M}_{0,0,n}$, to derive explicit tree-level scattering amplitudes with Ramond insertions.</description>

Abstract: For any sheaf of sets $\mathcal F$ on $Sm/k$, it is well known that the universal $\mathbb A^1$-invariant quotient of $\mathcal F$ is given as the colimit of sheaves $\mathcal S^n(\mathcal F)$ where $\mathcal S(F)$ is the sheaf of naive $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of $\mathcal F$. We show that these infinite iterations of naive $\mathbb A^1$-connected components in the construction of universal $\mathbb A^1$-invariant quotient for a scheme are certainly required. For every $n$, we construct an $\mathbb A^1$-connected variety $X_n$ such that $\mathcal S^n(X_n)\neq \mathcal S^{n+1}(X_n)$ and $\mathcal S^{n+2}(X_n)=*$.</description>

      <title>Deformations of I-surfaces with elliptic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An I-surface $S$ is an algebraic surface of general type with $K_S^2 = 1$ and $p_g(S) = 2$. Recent research has centered on trying to give an explicit description of the KSBA compactification of the moduli space of these surfaces. The possible normal Gorenstein examples have been enumerated by work of Franciosi-Pardini-Rollenske. The goal of this paper is to give a more precise description of such surfaces in case their singularities are simple elliptic and/or cusp singularities, and to work out their deformation theory. In particular, under some mild general position assumptions, we show that deformations of the surfaces in question are versal for deformations of the singular points, with two exceptions where the discrepancy is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Computing Galois cohomology of a real linear algebraic group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a linear algebraic group, not necessarily connected or reductive, over the field of real numbers R. We describe a method, implemented on computer, to find the first Galois cohomology set H^1(R,G). The output is a list of 1-cocycles in G. Moreover, we have an implemented algorithm that, given a 1-cocycle z in Z^1(R,G), finds the cocycle in the computed list to which z is equivalent, together with an element of G(C) realizing the equivalence.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in terms of elliptic and hyperelliptic $\sigma$ functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the elliptic function solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are reduced to the algebraic differential relation in terms of the Weierstrass sigma function, $\displaystyle{ \left[-{\frak{i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} +\alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial u}\right]\Psi -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2}\Psi +(\Psi^* \Psi) \Psi = \frac12 (2\beta+\alpha^2-3\wp(v))\Psi }$, where $\Psi(u;v, t):=\mathrm{e}^{\alpha u+{\frak{i}}\beta t+c}$ $\displaystyle{\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\zeta(v)u}\sigma(u+v)}{\sigma(u)\sigma(v)}}$, its dual $\Psi^*(u; v,t)$, and certain complex numbers $\alpha, \beta$ and $c$. In this paper, we generalize the algebraic differential relation to those of genera two and three in terms of the hyperelliptic sigma functions.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>

      <title>On closed definable subsets in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hensel minimal structures on non-trivially valued fields $K$. The main aim is to establish the following two properties of closed 0-definable subsets $A$ in the affine spaces $K^{n}$. Every such subset $A$ is the zero locus of a continuous 0-definable function $f:K^{n} \to K$, and there exists a 0-definable retraction $r: K^{n} \to A$. While the former property is a non-Archimedean counterpart of the one from o-minimal geometry, the former does not hold in real geometry in general. The proofs make use of a model-theoretic compactness argument and ubiquity of clopen sets in non-Archimedean geometry.</description>
