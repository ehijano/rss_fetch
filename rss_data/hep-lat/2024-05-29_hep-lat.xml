      <title>Nucleon Helicity Parton Distribution Function in the Continuum Limit with Self-Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice calculation of the nucleon isovector helicity parton distribution function (PDF) in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) that uses the hybrid scheme with self-renormalization. We use ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration at lattice spacings $a=\{0.1207,0.0888,0.0582\}$ fm, with $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of highly improved staggered quarks at sea pion mass of $M_{\pi}\approx 315$ MeV. We use clover-improved action for our valence quarks with nucleon boost momentum $P_z\approx 1.75$ GeV and high-statistics measurements for the LaMET matrix elements. We perform an extrapolation to the continuum limit and improve the handling of systematic errors using renormalization-group resummation (RGR) and leading-renormalon resummation (LRR). Our final nucleon helicity PDF is renormalized in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at energy scale $\mu=2.0$ GeV. We compare our results with and without the two systematic improvements of RGR and LRR at each lattice spacing as well as the continuum limit, and we see that the application of RGR and LRR greatly reduces the systematic errors across the whole $x$ range. Our continuum results with both RGR and LRR show a small positive antiquark region for the nucleon helicity PDF as well as a change of as much as a factor of two in the central values compared to results with neither RGR or LRR. By contrast, the application of RGR and LRR only changes the central values by about 5\% in the quark region. We compare our lattice results with the global fits by the JAM, NNPDF and DSSV collaborations, and we observe some tension between our results.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction: threshold to very high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ photoproduction, which exposes the $c \bar c$ content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to c\bar c + \mathbb P \to J/\psi$ and couples the intermediate $c \bar c$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P $) exchange, is used to deliver a description of available data, viz. both differential and total cross sections from near threshold, where data has newly been acquired, to invariant mass $W \approx 300\,$GeV. The study suggests that it is premature to link existing $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are necessary before the validity of any such connections can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Applications of flow models to the generation of correlated lattice QCD ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned normalizing flows can be used in the context of lattice quantum field theory to generate statistically correlated ensembles of lattice gauge fields at different action parameters. This work demonstrates how these correlations can be exploited for variance reduction in the computation of observables. Three different proof-of-concept applications are demonstrated using a novel residual flow architecture: continuum limits of gauge theories, the mass dependence of QCD observables, and hadronic matrix elements based on the Feynman-Hellmann approach. In all three cases, it is shown that statistical uncertainties are significantly reduced when machine-learned flows are incorporated as compared with the same calculations performed with uncorrelated ensembles or direct reweighting.</description>

      <title>Digitization and subduction of $SU(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of lattice gauge theories on quantum computers necessitates digitizing gauge fields. One approach involves substituting the continuous gauge group with a discrete subgroup, but the implications of this approximation still need to be clarified. To gain insights, we investigate the subduction of $ SU(2) $ and $ SU(3)$ to discrete crystal-like subgroups. Using classical lattice calculations, we show that subduction offers valuable information based on subduced direct sums, helping us identify additional terms to incorporate into the lattice action that can mitigate the effects of digitization. Furthermore, we compute the static potentials of all irreducible representations of $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ at a fixed lattice spacing. Our results reveal a percent-level agreement with the Casimir scaling of ( SU(3) ) for irreducible representations that subduce to a single $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ irreducible representation. This provides a diagnostic measure of approximation quality, as some irreducible representations closely match the expected results while others exhibit significant deviations.</description>
