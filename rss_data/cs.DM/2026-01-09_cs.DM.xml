      <title>Large induced forests in planar multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, denote by $a(G)$ the number of vertices in the largest induced forest in $G$. The Albertson-Berman conjecture, which is open since 1979, states that $a(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$ for all simple planar graphs $G$. We show that the version of this problem for multigraphs (allowing parallel edges) is easily reduced to the problem about the independence number of simple planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that $a(M) \geq \frac{n}{4}$ for all planar multigraphs $M$ and that this lower bound is tight. Then, we study the case when the number of pairs of vertices with parallel edges, which we denote by $k$, is small. In particular, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{2}{5}n-\frac{k}{10}$ and that the Albertson-Berman conjecture for simple planar graphs, assuming that it holds, would imply the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{n-k}{2}$ for planar multigraphs, which would be better than the general lower bound when $k$ is small. Finally, we study the variant of the problem where the plane multigraphs are prohibited from having $2$-faces, which is the main non-trivial problem that we introduce in this article. For that variant without $2$-faces, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{3}{10}n+\frac{7}{30}$ and give a construction of an infinite sequence of multigraphs with $a(M)=\frac{3}{7}n+\frac{4}{7}$.</description>

      <title>Branch-width of connectivity functions is fixed-parameter tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} \gamma n^6 \log n$, where $\gamma$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $\gamma n^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hlin\v{e}n\'y [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number.
  Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture.
  Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols have been suggested in the literature to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Toward P vs NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>
