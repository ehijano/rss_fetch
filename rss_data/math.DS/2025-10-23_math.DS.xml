      <title>A CAT(0)-approach to the marked length spectral rigidity of Sinai billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral rigidity problem for Sinai billiards with finite horizon, specifically asking whether the geometry of the billiard table can be recovered from the lengths of its (marked) periodic trajectories. To address this, we introduce an enriched marked length spectrum EL and prove that two Sinai billiards sharing the same EL must be isometric. Our approach involves approximating the billiard flow using geodesic flows on smooth Riemannian surfaces. In the limit, these flows converge to CAT(0) spaces, which encode both the lengths of periodic orbits and the geometry of the boundary. We adapt Otal's original method -- developed for marked length spectrum rigidity in negatively curved surfaces -- to this new setting. Here, the lack of curvature control is offset by metric comparison estimates. By integrating the analysis of geodesic flows with perturbative techniques for periodic orbits, we establish a rigidity theorem for Sinai billiards with finite horizon. These results extend the classical theory of marked length spectrum rigidity beyond the Riemannian setting, demonstrating that even in discontinuous dynamical systems, geometric information is rigidly encoded in spectral data.</description>

      <title>More stability and convergence results for higher-order Wiener-Wintner systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Higher-order Wiener-Wintner averages" were constructed by Assani, Folks, and Moore to quantitatively control multiple recurrence averages. Systems in which these averages converge at a polynomial rate for a sufficiently large subset are termed "higher-order Wiener-Wintner systems of power type", in which properties like pointwise convergence of multiple recurrence averages and multiple return times averages has been shown. We establish that these higher-order Wiener-Wintner averages satisfy a type of sublinearity, and that they bound conditional expectations and products, which transfers to improved stability results of higher-order Wiener-Wintner systems under sums, factors, and products. We also establish more general convergence results for such systems, which include a polynomial return times theorem and convergence of the multilinear one-side ergodic Hilbert transform with polynomial phase.</description>

      <title>The behavioral spillover effect: Modeling behavioral interdependencies in multi-pathogen dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the recent pandemic, a rise in COVID-19 cases was followed by a decline in influenza. In the absence of cross-immunity, a potential explanation for the observed pattern is behavioral: non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) designed and promoted for one disease also reduce the spread of others. We study short-term and long-term dynamics of two pathogens where NPIs targeting one pathogen indirectly influence the spread of another - a phenomenon we term behavioral spillover. We examine how perceived risk of and response to one disease substantially alters the spread of other pathogens, revealing how waves of different pathogens emerge over time as a result of behavioral interdependencies and human response. Our analysis identifies the parameter space where two diseases simultaneously co-exist, and where shifts in prevalence occur. Our findings are consistent with observations from the COVID-19 pandemic, where NPIs contributed to significant declines in infections such as influenza, pneumonia, and Lyme disease.</description>

      <title>Topological dynamics for the endograph metric II: Extremely radical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ we investigate several topological dynamical properties for its Zadeh extension $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$ endowed with the endograph metric $d_{E}$. In particular, we prove that for some contractive and expansive properties, for chain recurrence, chain transitivity and chain mixing, and for the shadowing property, the endograph metric behaves in an extremely radical way. Our results not only resolve certain open questions in the existing literature, but also yield completely new outcomes concerning the chain-type notions considered and the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Conditional Entropy for Diffusion Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of diffusion processes on graphs is the basis for many network science and machine learning approaches. Entropic measures of network-based diffusion have recently been employed to investigate the reversibility of these processes and the diversity of the modeled systems. While results about their steady state are well-known, very few exact results about their time evolution exist. Here, we introduce the conditional entropy of heat diffusion in graphs. We demonstrate that this entropic measure satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thereby providing a physical interpretation of diffusion dynamics on networks. We outline a mathematical framework that contextualizes diffusion and conditional entropy within the theories of continuous-time Markov chains and information theory. Furthermore, we obtain explicit results for its evolution on complete, path, and circulant graphs, as well as a mean-field approximation for Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. We also obtain asymptotic results for general networks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate several properties of conditional entropy for diffusion over random graphs, such as the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ E $ be a non-empty compact subset of the Riemann sphere and $T$ be a rational map of degree at least two. We study the associated \emph{orbital set}, that is, the backwards orbit of $E$ under $T$, and study the relationship between the upper box dimension of the orbital set and the upper box dimensions of the Julia set of $T$ and the initial set $ E$. Our results extend previous work on inhomogeneous iterated function systems to the setting of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of lowerable, D-lowerable, P-lowerable, hereditarily lowerable, and hereditarily uniformly lowerable for countably infinite amenable group actions. We show that a system with finite entropy is lowerable, D-lowerable, and P-lowerable, and that asymptotic h-expansiveness is equivalent to hereditary uniform lowerability. Moreover, we prove a Bowen's type theorem for amenable group actions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of invariant measures via generic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the spectrum of an ergodic invariant measure by examining the behaviour of its generic points. We define regular Wiener--Wintner generic points for a measure to generalise the characterisation of generic points for discrete spectrum measure from Lenz et al. [Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems vol. \textbf{44} (2024), no. 2, 524--568]. We also study limits of sequences of generic points with respect to the Besicovitch pseudometric. This translates to results about limits of measures with respect to the metric rho-bar $\bar{\rho}$ generalising Ornstein's d-bar metric. We study how the spectrum behaves when passing to the limit and we prove that points generic for discrete spectrum, totally ergodic, or (weakly) mixing measures, property K, zero entropy measures form a closed set with respect to the Besicovitch pseudometric. Hence, the same holds for corresponding measures with respect to the rho-bar metric. Our methods have already been used to prove existence of ergodic measures with desired properties, in particular with discrete spectrum. They also lead to a new proof of rational discrete spectrum of the Mirsky measure associated with a given set of $\mathscr B$-free numbers.</description>

      <title>Extreme Event Aware ($\eta$-) Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or $\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted' extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method. Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and real-world precipitation downscaling problems.</description>

      <title>The continuity of Beurling density and Beurling dimension of spectra of a class of self-affine spectral measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Beurling dimension of the spectra of certain singularly continuous spectral measures possesses an intermediate property. In this paper, we establish that for a class of self-affine spectral measures $\mu$, both the Beurling dimension and Beurling density of their spectra attain full flexibility simultaneously. Specifically, for any $t\in (0,\dim_H^w(\supp(\mu))]$ and $s\in [0,\infty)$, there exists a spectrum $\Lambda:=\Lambda_{t,s}$ of $\mu$ satisfying \[\dim_{Be}(\Lambda)=t\quad\text{and}\quad D_{t}^+(\Lambda)=s\] where $\dim_H^w$ denotes the pseudo Hausdorff dimension, $\dim_{Be}$ denotes the Beurling dimension and $D_{t}^+$ denotes the $t$-Beurling density. These results provide new insights into the structure of the spectra for a singularly continuous spectral measure.</description>

      <title>The Hopf--Rinow Theorem and Ma\~n\'e's Critical Value for Magnetic Geodesics on Half Lie-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate \emph{right-invariant magnetic systems} on half-Lie groups, which consist of a strong right-invariant Riemannian metric and a right-invariant closed two-form. The main examples are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. In this setting, we define \emph{Ma\~n\'e's critical value} on the universal cover for weakly exact right-invariant magnetic fields. First, we prove that the lift of the magnetic flow to the universal cover coincides with a Finsler geodesic flow for energies above this threshold. Finally, we show that for energies above Ma\~n\'e's critical value, the full Hopf--Rinow theorem holds for such magnetic systems, thereby generalizing the work of Contreras and Merry from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to this infinite-dimensional context. Our work extends the recent results of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to magnetic geodesic flows.</description>

      <title>Escape of Mass of the $p$-Cantor Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. In 2017, Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) conjectured that any Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exhibits full escape of mass with respect to any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$. In 2025, this was shown to be false in the case $p=2$ and $P(t)=t$ by Nesharim, Shapira and the first named author. This work shows that for any odd prime $p$ and any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, the so-called $p$-Cantor sequence provides a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, the concepts of maximal escape of mass and generic escape of mass are introduced. These lead to two natural variations of the KPS conjecture, both of which are shown to hold for all previous counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Fractals Emerging from the Toepltiz Determinants of the p-Cantor Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a pair of papers, whose collective goal is to disprove a conjecture of Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) on the escape of mass of Laurent series. This paper lays the foundations on which its sibling builds.
  In particular, the $p$-Cantor sequence is introduced. This generalises the classical Cantor sequence into a $p$-automatic sequence for any odd prime $p$. Two main results are then established, both of which play a key role in the disproof of the KPS conjecture.
  First, the two-dimensional sequence comprised of the Toeplitz determinants of the $p$-Cantor sequence over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is extensively studied. Indeed, the so-called profile of this sequence (which encodes the zero regions) is shown to be [p,p]-automatic. In the process of deriving this, the theory of so-called number walls is developed greatly. Many of these results are stated in full generality, as the authors expect them to be useful when tackling similar problems going forward.
  Secondly, a natural process is described that converts number wall of an automatic sequence into a unique fractal. When this sequence is the aforementioned $p$-Cantor sequence, this fractal is shown to have Hausdorff dimension $\log((p^2+1)/2)/\log(p).$</description>

      <title>Universal bound on the Lyapunov spectrum of quantum master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral properties of positive maps provide pivotal information for understanding the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with their environment. Furthermore, central problems in quantum information such as the characterization of entanglement may be reformulated in terms of spectral properties of positive maps. The present work aims to contribute to a better understanding of the spectrum of positive maps. Specifically, our main result is a new proof of a universal bound on the $d^{2}-1$ generically non vanishing decay rates $\Gamma_{i}$ of time-autonomous quantum master equations on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space: $$
  \Gamma_{\mathrm{max}}\,\leq\,c_{d}\,\sum_{i=1}^{d^{2}-1}\Gamma_{i}
  \nonumber $$ The prefactor $c_{d}$ , which we explicitly determine, depends only on the dimension $d$ and varies depending on the sub-class of positive maps to which the semigroup solution of the master equation belongs. We provide a brief but self-consistent survey of these concepts. We obtain our main result by resorting to the theory of Lyapunov exponents, a central concept in the study of dynamical systems, control theory, and out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We thus show that progress in understanding positive maps in quantum mechanics may require ideas at the crossroads between different disciplines. For this reason, we adopt a notation and presentation style aimed at reaching readers with diverse backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of epidemiological compartment models with conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of a framework for sparse model identification of differential equations from timeseries data in the context of compartmental models in epidemiology. Such frameworks often seek a sparse representation from a polynomial basis in the state variables which reproduces the timeseries. Out-of-the-box approaches for the underlying sparse regression problem have moderate success reproducing the provided timeseries, but typically fail at producing a consistent, interpretable compartment model and conserving the total population, which are common properties in principled compartment modeling. Additionally, the conserved polynomial quantities, such as the sum of state variables, add algebraic nuances to a polynomial design matrix. We propose a linear program formulation to solve these issues by posing a pure one-norm objective, sampling from the nullspace of the design matrix, and imposing a set of linear constraints for between-compartment flows. We conduct several numerical experiments on synthetic data and succeed in ensuring model sparsity, accurately capturing system dynamics, and preserving conservation of population.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected synchronization in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled heterogeneous oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations thereof), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our rigorous analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes act as independent pacemakers.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds and guaranteed convergence of the Koopman-Hill projection stability method for linear time-periodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman-Hill projection method offers an efficient approach for stability analysis of linear time-periodic systems, and thereby also for the Floquet stability analysis of periodic solutions of nonlinear systems. However, its accuracy has previously been supported only by numerical evidence, lacking rigorous theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first explicit error bound for the truncation error of the Koopman-Hill projection method, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for its application. The bound applies to linear time-periodic systems whose Fourier coefficients decay exponentially with a sufficient rate, and is derived using constructive series expansions. The bound quantifies the difference between the true and approximated fundamental solution matrices, clarifies conditions for guaranteed convergence, and enables conservative but reliable inference of Floquet multipliers and stability properties. Additionally, the same methodology applied to a subharmonic formulation demonstrates improved convergence rates of the latter. Numerical examples, including the Mathieu equation and the Duffing oscillator, illustrate the practical relevance of the bound and underscore its importance as the first rigorous theoretical justification for the Koopman-Hill projection method.</description>

      <title>LDMD with Temporally Adaptive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08065</link>

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a widely used data-driven algorithm for predicting the future states of dynamical systems. However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD (LDMD) framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong linear forecasting capabilities with time-domain segmentation techniques. In this framework, the temporal domain is segmented into multiple subintervals, within which snapshot matrices are constructed and localized predictions are performed. We first present the localized DMD method with predefined segmentation, and then explore an adaptive segmentation strategy to further enhance computational efficiency and prediction robustness. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for the proposed framework. The effectiveness of LDMD is demonstrated on four benchmark problems-Burgers', Allen-Cahn, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that LDMD significantly enhances long-term predictive accuracy while preserving high computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>When any four solutions are independent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>
