      <title>Multiplication Operator Semigroups on Banach lattice valued continuous function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and characterize, on the Banach lattice valued continuous function space, multiplication operators generating strongly continuous multiplication operator semigroups. Our characterization is the generalization of known results for the scalar-valued continuous functions $C_0(\Omega)$ vanishing at infinity, on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space $\Omega$, to Banach lattice $C_0(\Omega, E)$ of continuous Banach lattice $E$-valued functions vanishing at infinity.</description>

      <title>Solutions of abstract wave equations, eigenvalues and resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove general representation formulas for strongly continuous cosine and sine operator families in terms of scattering resonances of their generators. This generalizes known results related to decay, growth and oscillatory behavior of solutions of abstract wave equations to a wide class of non-self-adjoint operators in Banach spaces. Inspired by the classical results on scattering resonances for Schr\"odinger operators with compactly supported potentials, we develop quite general abstract scheme of resonances that involves extensions of the resolvent operators from Banach to Frechet spaces. We split the solutions of the wave equations in two parts: The first part is related to finite rank operators induced by the eigenvalues and resonances while the second part involves a partial inversion of the Laplace transform whose exponential behavior is effectively controlled. Illustrations and applications cover a wide class of generators including the Schr\"odinger operators with non-symmetric complex matrix potentials, linearizations of nonlinear wave equations, Aharonov-Bohm and block-box Hamiltonians, etc.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder property of the resolvent of a monotone operator in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space, and let $J: E \to E^{*}$ denote the normalized duality mapping. In this paper, we establish an upper bound for $\|Jx - Jy\|$ in $q$-uniformly smooth Banach spaces, where the bound is expressed in terms of a relatively simple function of $\|x - y\|$. Subsequently, we derive the H\"{o}lder property of mappings of firmly nonexpansive type in 2-uniformly convex and $q$-uniformly smooth Banach spaces ($1&lt;q\leq 2$). As an application,
  we apply this result to the resolvent of a monotone operator in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms, Moduli, and Cohomological Dimension for Twisted Triangular Banach Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study twisted triangular Banach algebras T_sigma(A,B;X), built from Banach algebras A,B, a Banach A-B bimodule X, and a pair of automorphisms sigma=(sigma_A,sigma_B). This construction extends the classical triangular framework by incorporating twisted module actions on the off-diagonal block. We obtain a complete isomorphism classification: T_sigma is isomorphic to T_tau precisely when the diagonal twists are conjugate, the bimodule admits an (alpha,beta)-equivariant isomorphism, and a shear cocycle satisfies a natural identity. In the case of group algebras, the classification detects conjugacy classes inside Aut(G), yielding new dynamical invariants absent from the untwisted setting. On the homological side, we establish sharp bounds for the Hochschild cohomological dimension and deduce that T_sigma is amenable only when X=0 and both A,B are amenable. Thus twisting enriches the classical theory while preserving extension-theoretic control of cohomology.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theorem for Path-Averaged Contractions in Complete b-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the fixed point result for Path-Averaged Contractions (PA-contractions) from complete metric spaces to complete b-metric spaces. We prove that every continuous PA-contraction on a complete b-metric space has a unique fixed point, provided the contraction constant $ \alpha $ satisfies $ s\alpha &lt; 1 $, where $ s \geq 1 $ is the b-metric coefficient. The proof relies on geometric decay of successive distances and the generalized triangle inequality. This result paves the way for extending averaged contraction principles to other classical types, such as Kannan, Chatterjea, and \'Ciri\'c-type mappings, as well as Wardowski's F-contractions, in generalized metric settings.</description>

      <title>The Central Limit Theorem for random exponents on a Hilbert space in the Weak Operator Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H})$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Central Limit Theorem is known for the sums of i.i.d. random operators. Instead of the sum, there may be considered the composition of random exponents $e^{A_i/n}$. We obtain the Central Limit Theorem in the Weak Operator Topology for centralized and normalized random exponents of i.i.d. linear continuous operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Some results on spectra and certain norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the norms of powers $(\lVert x^n\rVert)_{n\geq 0}$ of a Banach algebra element $x$, the largest possible value of the minimum modulus on the spectrum of $x$ is determined. It is also shown that, given a Banach algebra element $x$ and a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{C}$ with maximum modulus no more than the spectral radius of $x$, there exists a Banach algebra element $y$ with $\lVert y^n\rVert=\lVert x^n\rVert$ for all $n\geq 0$ and spectrum equal to the union of the spectrum of $x$ and $K$. These results, along with the spectral radius formula, are generalized to the joint spectrum of several commutative Banach algebra elements. The generalization of the spectral radius formula presented gives the maximum possible joint spectrum for commutative Banach algebra elements $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, given the norms $(\lVert x_1^{i_1}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\rVert)_{i_1,\ldots,i_n\geq 0}$.</description>

      <title>Quaternion Toeplitz matrices and their fundamental properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toeplitz matrices are characterized by their constant diagonals, have been extensively studied in various settings, including over real and complex numbers. However, their study over quaternions is quite sparse. In this paper, we investigate the structure and the algebraic properties of quaternion Toeplitz matrices. Most importantly, we established a complete characterization of all normal Toeplitz matrices having entries commutative quaternions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Jacobi operator (T,D(T)) associated with an indeterminate Hamburger moment problem, and present countable subsets S of the domain D(T) such that span(S) is dense in \ell^2. As an example we have S={(p_n(u))+B(u)(p_n(0)):D(u)=0}, where (p_n) denotes the orthonormal polynomials of the moment problem and B,D are two of the Nevanlinna functions. It is also proved that sets like S are optimal in the sense that if one vector is removed, then the span is no longer dense.</description>

      <title>Log-majorizations between quasi-geometric type means for matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}$, $p&gt;0$ and positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, we consider the quasi-extension $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A^p,B^p)^{1/p}$ of several $\alpha$-weighted geometric type matrix means $\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A,B)$ such as the $\alpha$-weighted geometric mean in Kubo--Ando's sense, the R\'enyi mean, etc. The log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ is examined for pairs $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$ of those $\alpha$-weighted geometric type means. The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>On almost commuting unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A question going back to Halmos asks when two approximately commuting matrices of a certain kind are close to exactly commuting matrices of the same kind. It has long been known that there is a winding number obstruction for approximately commuting unitary matrices to be close, in a dimension-independent way, to genuinely commuting unitary matrices. In this paper, under the vanishing of the said obstruction, we obtain effective bounds for the distance to commuting unitary matrices in terms of the commutator of the original matrices.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ satisfies a specific light-tail condition, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets or their one-sided versions (or the product of two empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper rely on tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>

      <title>Divergence Phase Index: A Riesz-Transform Framework for Multidimensional Phase Difference Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Divergence Phase Index (DPI), a novel framework for quantifying phase differences in one and multidimensional signals, grounded in harmonic analysis via the Riesz transform. Based on classical Hilbert Transform phase measures, the DPI extends these principles to higher dimensions, offering a geometry-aware metric that is invariant to intensity scaling and sensitive to structural changes. We applied this method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings during epileptic seizures, high-resolution microscopy images, and paintings. In the 1D case, the DPI robustly detects hypersynchronization associated with generalized epilepsy, while in 2D, it reveals subtle, imperceptible changes in images and artworks. Additionally, it can detect rotational variations in highly isotropic microscopy images. The DPI's robustness to amplitude variations and its adaptability across domains enable its use in diverse applications from nonlinear dynamics, complex systems analysis, to multidimensional signal processing.</description>

Abstract: This note aims to present novel positive linear operators involving the Wright function. Furthermore, the present research established the moments of these newly defined operators and estimated the convergence rate using the classical modulus of continuity. Additionally, the convergence rate in the Lipschitz spaces, their A-statistical convergence property, and $({\lambda}, {\gamma})$-statistical convergence properties have been covered.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the existing generalized separation statements including the conventional extremal principle and its extensions differ {in the ways norms on product spaces are defined}. We prove a general separation statement with arbitrary product norms covering the existing results of this kind. The proof is divided into a series of claims and exposes the key steps and arguments used when proving generalized separation statements. As an application, we prove dual necessary (sufficient) conditions for an abstract product norm extension of the approximate stationarity (transversality) property.</description>

Abstract: This note examines the implications of randomly selecting vectors from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space on linear independence, assuming that for all $k$, the first $k$ vectors follow an absolutely continuous law with respect to a probability measure. It demonstrates that no constraints on the random dimension of their span are necessary, provided that all finite-dimensional vector subspaces are considered negligible with respect to the Hilbert space probability measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate what we term "generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn Minkowski conjecture. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed theory of random sequential compactness, we prove the random Kakutani fixed point theorem in random normed modules: if G is a random sequentially compact L0-convex subset of a random normed module, then every -stable Tc-upper semicontinuous mapping F:G to 2G such that F(x) is closed and L0-convex for each x in G, has a fixed point. This is the first fixed point theorem for set-valued mappings in random normed modules, providing a random generalization of the classical Kakutani fixed point theorem as well as a set-valued extension of the noncompact Schauder fixed point theorem established in Math. Ann. 391(3), 3863--3911 (2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in Kubo-Ando theory make frequent use of the relationship between Kubo-Ando connections and positive operator monotone functions. This relationship is deeply connected to L\"owner's theorem and our aim is to provide a comprehensive review of one of the proofs of L\"owner's theorem. Our motivation arises from the fact that the foundational components upon which the theorem rests are found within a variety of sources, rendering it difficult to obtain a complete understanding of the proof without engaging in substantial external consultation. By consolidating these elements into a single, continuous account, the proof becomes substantially more accessible and may be assimilated with greater clarity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bounded symbols of Toeplitz operators on Paley-Wiener spaces and a weak factorization theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result by R. Rochberg says that every bounded Toeplitz operator $T$ on the Hilbert Paley-Wiener space $\mathrm{PW}_a^2$ admits a bounded symbol $\varphi$. We generalize this result to Toeplitz operators on the Banach Paley-Wiener spaces $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$, $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$. The Toeplitz commutator theorem describes the integral identity that must hold for a bounded operator $T$ on $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$ to be a Toeplitz operator on $\mathrm{PW}_a^p$. We prove this theorem in the continuous case, thus extending the result previously obtained by D. Sarason in the discrete case. Upon combining the results, we establish the weak factorization theorem, namely, for $p,q&gt;1$, $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$, any function $h$ belonging to $\mathrm{PW}^1_{2a}$ can be represented as $$h=\sum_{k\geqslant 0}f_k\bar{g}_k,\qquad f_k\in\mathrm{PW}_a^p,\,g_k\in\mathrm{PW}_a^q.$$</description>

      <title>Concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems under Karamata regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, H\"olderian error bounds and H\"older regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number $k$ instead, of say, a function of the iterate $x^k$. While it is well-known that under H\"olderian-like assumptions many algorithms converge linearly/sublinearly (depending on the exponent), little it is known when the underlying problem data does not satisfy H\"olderian assumptions, which may happen if a problem involves exponentials and logarithms. Our main innovation is the usage of the theory of regularly varying functions which we showcase by obtaining concrete convergence rates for quasi-cylic algorithms in non-H\"olderian settings. This includes certain rates that are neither sublinear nor linear but sit somewhere in-between, including a case where the rate is expressed via the Lambert W function. Finally, we connect our discussion to o-minimal geometry and show that, under mild assumptions, definable operators in any o-minimal structure are always Karamata regular.</description>

Abstract: We affirmatively resolve a question posed by Uffe Haagerup in 1975 on the positive version of the bipolar theorem on the dual spaces of C$^*$-algebras. As a direct consequence, we obtain a complete set of four positive Hahn-Banach separation theorems on von Neumann algebras, their preduals, C$^*$-algebras, and their duals. Furthermore, with the idea used to solve the problem, we simplify Haagerup's original solution to Dixmier's problem on normal weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their memoir. Later results will be discussed in future papers. We develop here some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
