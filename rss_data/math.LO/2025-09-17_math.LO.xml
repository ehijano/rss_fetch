      <title>Labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures and applications in choiceless set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12656v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the labelled growth rate of an $\omega$-categorical structure $\mathfrak{A}$, i.e., the number of orbits of $Aut(\mathfrak{A})$ on $n$-tuples of distinct elements, and show that the model-theoretic property of monadic stability yields a gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates. As a further application, we obtain gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates in hereditary graph classes, with no a priori assumption of $\omega$-categoricity. We also establish a way to translate results about labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures into combinatorial statements about sets with weak finiteness properties in the absence of the axiom of choice, and derive several results from this translation.</description>

      <title>Finite coproducts, coregularity and coexactness for profinite interior algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous articles, we showed that the category of profinite $L$-algebras (where $L$ is a normal modal logic with the finite model property) is monadic over $\textbf{Set}$. Then, we developed sequent calculi for extensions of the language of $L$ with infinitary conjunctions and disjunctions, proving completeness with respect to profinite $L$-algebras and relating syntactic properties of the calculi with regularity/exactness properties of the category opposite to profinite $L$-algebras. In this paper, we focus on the algebraic perspective: we characterize those $L$ extending $S4$ whose profinite algebras enjoy such categorical properties.</description>

      <title>Definability of some $k$-ary Relations Over Second Order kinds of Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the exprissibility in monadic second order logic of certain relations of importance in computer science. For integers $n\geq 1$ and $k\leq b$, a $k$-tuple of sequences in $\{0,1,\ldots, b-1\}^n$ are said to be $k$-hashed if there is a coordinate where they all differ. A set $\mathcal{C}$ of sequences is said to be a $k$-hash code if any $k$ distinct elements are $k$-hashed. Testing whether a code is $k$-hashing and determining the largest size of $k$-hash codes is an important problem in computer science. The use of general purpose solvers for this problem leads to question what minimal logic is needed to represent the problem.
  In this paper, we prove that the $k$-hashing relation on $k$-tuples is not definable in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSO), highlighting its limitations for this problem. Instead, the property can be expressed in extensions of the MSO that add the equi-cardinality relation.</description>

      <title>Determination of the fifth Busy Beaver value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that an $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-zero tape before halting, and $S$ was historically introduced by Tibor Rad\'o in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of an uncomputable function. The proof enumerates $181,385,789$ Turing machines with 5 states and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not. Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value ever to be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (bbchallenge$.$org).</description>

      <title>Large cardinals, structural reflection, and the HOD Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce exacting cardinals and a strengthening of these, ultraexacting cardinals. These are natural large cardinals defined equivalently as weak forms of rank-Berkeley cardinals, strong forms of J\'onsson cardinals, or in terms of principles of structural reflection. However, they challenge commonly held intuition on strong axioms of infinity. We prove that ultraexacting cardinals are consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) relative to the existence of an I0 embedding. However, the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal below a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC with a proper class of I0 embeddings, thus challenging the linear--incremental picture of the large cardinal hierarchy. We show that the existence of an exacting cardinal implies that V is not equal to HOD (G\"odel's universe of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable sets), showing that these cardinals surpass the current hierarchy of large cardinals consistent with ZFC. Moreover, we prove that the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal implies the "V is far from HOD" alternative of Woodin's HOD Dichotomy. In particular, it follows that the consistency of ZFC with an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal would refute Woodin's HOD Conjecture and Ultimate-L Conjecture. Finally, we show that the consistency of ZF with certain large cardinals beyond choice implies the consistency of ZFC with the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures arising from the finite condensation on linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite condensation $\sim_F$ is an equivalence relation defined on a linear order $L$ by $x \sim_F y$ if and only if the set of points lying between $x$ and $y$ is finite. We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = \operatorname{o.t.}\left((LM)/\!\sim_F\right)$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the order type of the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $\omega, \omega^*,$ and $\zeta$ (where $\omega^*$ is the reverse ordering of $\omega$, and $\zeta$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, \omega, \omega^*, \zeta\}$ forms a left regular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We study these maps' effect on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form. In particular, we examine the extent to which one of these maps, sending $\alpha$ to the order type of $\alpha$ modulo the finite condensation, behaves similarly to a derivative operator on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fingerprinting for Trees and Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To cater to the needs of (Zero Knowledge) proofs for (mathematical) proofs, we describe a method to transform  formal sentences in 2x2-matrices over multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, such that usual proof-steps like modus-ponens or the substitution are easy to compute from the matrices corresponding to the terms or formulas used as arguments. By evaluating the polynomial  variables in random elements of a suitably chosen finite field, the proof is replaced by a numeric sequence. Only the values corresponding to the axioms have to be computed from scratch. The values corresponding to derived formulas are computed from the values corresponding to their ancestors by applying the homomorphic properties. On such sequences, various Zero Knowledge methods can be applied. </description>

      <title>Borel distinguishing number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study definable variants of the notion of the distinguishing number of a graph in descriptive set theoretic setting. We introduce the notion of the Borel distinguishing number of a Borel graph and provide examples that separate distinguishing number and Borel distinguishing number at various levels. More specifically, we prove that there exist Borel graphs with countable distinguishing number but uncountable Borel distinguishing number and that, for every integer $n \geq 3$, there exists a Borel graph with distinguishing number $2$ whose Borel distinguishing number is finite and at least $n$.</description>

      <title>The interdefinability of expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.</description>

      <title>Monoidal bicategories, differential linear logic, and analytic functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop further the theory of monoidal bicategories by introducing and studying bicategorical counterparts of the notions of a linear exponential comonad, as considered in the study of linear logic, and of a codereliction transformation, introduced to study differential linear logic via differential categories. As an application, we extend the differential calculus of Joyal's analytic functors to analytic functors between presheaf categories, just as ordinary calculus extends from a single variable to many variables.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>
