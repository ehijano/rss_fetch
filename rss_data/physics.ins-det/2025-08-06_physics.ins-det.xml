      <title>Separate-scan atomic force microscope for fast infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-heterodyne scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) is applied in the mid-infrared region to detect the chemical composition of biomolecules on the nanoscale. However, the application of sSNOM in molecular biology has been limited to static images in air. Recently, bottom illumination sSNOM (BI-sSNOM) was developed for operation in water. Yet, the scan rate of sSNOM remains a bottleneck to record protein structural changes in aqueous solution on the seconds time scale. We designed an optical and mechanical system consisting of a separate scan high-speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM) coupled to the BI-sSNOM optics. The designed AFM scanner has a mechanical bandwidth of ca 70 kHz along the Z-axis, and ca 6 kHz along the XY-axis, equivalent to the sample scanning HS-AFM. The AFM performance is demonstrated by imaging actin filaments. The optical design is validated by sSNOM experiments on purple membranes and microtubules.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Characterisation of Silicon for the ETpathfinder Test Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, is designed to reduce noise in a wide band of frequencies compared to the current generation, through the use of new technologies. ETpathfinder, designed as an R&amp;D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the Leibniz-Institut f\"ur Kristallz\"uchtung. This material choice was made to pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed. Predictions are made of the contribution of the mirror substrate material to the overall ETpathfinder noise budget.</description>

      <title>The High Level Trigger and Express Data Production at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder, optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.
  Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic feedback during operations.
  This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.
  The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data taking.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for typical chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>

      <title>AION-10: Technical Design Report for a 10m Atom Interferometer in Oxford</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Technical Design Report presents AION-10, a 10-meter atom interferometer to be located at Oxford University using ultracold strontium atoms to make precision measurements of fundamental physics. AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.
  The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.
  Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.
  This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Towards a realistic noise modelling of quantum sensors for future satellite gravity missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the Earth's gravity field from space offers valuable insights into climate change, hydro- and biosphere evolution, and seismic activity. Current satellite gravimetry missions have demonstrated the utility of gravity data in understanding global mass transport phenomena, climate dynamics, and geological processes. However, state-of-the-art measurement techniques face noise and long-term drift limitations, which propagate into the recovery of Earth's time-varying gravity field. Quantum sensors, particularly Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI), offer promise for improving the accuracy and stability of space-based gravity measurements. Therefore, CAI has emerged as a promising measurement technique for future gravimetric satellite missions due to their potential for measuring gravitational forces and gradients with high precision and accuracy, particularly at low frequencies (sub-mHz). This study explores the sensitivity of CAI accelerometers and gradiometers to the errors in measuring the satellite's attitude. We explore the low-low satellite-to-satellite and gravity gradiometry concepts and build the respective analytical models of measurements and associated errors. We selected an ambitious scenario for CAI parameters that illustrates a potential path for increasing instrument accuracies and capabilities for space gravimetry. Two operational modes, concurrent (where a new cloud is generated while another is moved to the interferometric chamber) and sequential (where cloud generation and interferometry happen in the same place), are compared to mitigate the effects of inaccurately known attitude rates on Coriolis accelerations. The sequential mode shows the potential to reduce these effects since the atom cloud has an initial zero velocity. [...]</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation. A faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, a coil with inductance of 491 ${\mu}H$ and resistance of 0.26 ${\Omega}$, corresponding to a time constant of ~1.9 ms, is driven so that its current faithfully follows the control signals from -1A to +1A. Capable of completing a full-scale transition in just ~31 ${\mu}s$, with an effective bandwidth of 15.2 kHz. This corresponds to an improvement by a factor of more than 20 in both bandwidth and switching speed over a conventional power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, both the bandwidth and the switching time can be tuned to match specific needs within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.</description>
