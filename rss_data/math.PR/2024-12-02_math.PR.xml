      <title>A star is born: Explosive Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes in random environment that explode, i.e. that grow infinitely large in finite time with positive probability. Building on recent work of the author and Iyer, we weaken certain assumptions required to prove that the branching process, at the time of explosion, contains a (unique) individual with an infinite offspring. We then apply these results to super-linear preferential attachment models. In particular, we fill gaps in some of the cases analysed in earlier work of the author and Iyer, and a study large range of previously unattainable cases.</description>

      <title>A Limit Theorem Clarifying the Physical Origin of Fractional Brownian Motion and Related Gaussian Models of Anomalous Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamical system describing the motion of a test-particle surrounded by $N$ Brownian particles with different masses. Physical principles of conservation of momentum and energy are met. We prove that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general (non-Markovian) Gaussian process whose covariance function is determined by the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles. In particular, with proper choices of the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles, we obtain fractional Brownian motion, a mixture of independent fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst parameters and the classical Wiener process. Moreover, we present some distributions of masses of the surround-particles leading to limiting processes which perform transition from ballistic to superdiffusion or from ballistic to classical diffusion.
  Keywords: fractional Brownian motion, limit theorems for stochastic processes, anomalous diffusion, heterogeneous environment, crowded environment</description>

      <title>On the intersection of critical percolation clusters and other tree-like random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study intersection properties of two or more independent tree-like random graphs. Our setting encompasses critical, possibly long range, Bernoulli percolation clusters, incipient infinite clusters, as well as critical branching random walk ranges. We obtain sharp excess deviation bounds on the number of intersection points of two or more clusters, under minimal assumption on the two-point function. The proof are based on new bounds on the n-point function, in case of critical percolation, and on the joint moments of local times of branching random walks</description>

      <title>Random polytopes in convex bodies: Bridging the gap between extremal containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of random polytopes arising as convex hulls of $n$ independent random points sampled from a family of block-beta distributions. Notably, this family includes the uniform distribution on a product of Euclidean balls of varying dimensions as a key example. As $n\to\infty$, we establish explicit growth rates for the expected number of facets, which depend in a subtle way on the the underlying model parameters. For the case of the uniform distribution, we further examine the expected number of faces of arbitrary dimensions as well as the volume difference. Our findings reveal that the family of random polytopes we introduce exhibits novel interpolative properties, bridging the gap between the classical extremal cases observed in the behavior of random polytopes within smooth versus polytopal convex containers.</description>

      <title>Characteristic function and Esscher transform of a switching Levy model for the temperature dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend models for the dynamic of the temperatures by considering random switching between Levy noises instead of Brownian motions, with a mean-reverting movement towards a seasonal periodic function. The use of Levy noises allows for jumps, capturing, together with the regime changes, sudden and relatively persistent oscillations in the weather. An approximated close-form expression for the characteristic function of the temperature process under an Esscher transform is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand and generalize the findings presented in our previous work on the law of large numbers and the large deviation principle for Poisson processes with uniform catastrophes. We study three distinct scalings: sublinear (moderate deviations), linear (large deviations), and superlinear (superlarge deviations). Across these scales, we establish different yet coherent rate functions.</description>

      <title>Singular mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations in infinite dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of singular mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (MF-BSVIEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces. We consider the equation:
  \[ X(t) = \Psi(t) + \int_t^b F\big(t, s, X(s), Z(t, s), Z(s, t), \mathbb{E}[X(s)], \mathbb{E}[Z(t, s)], \mathbb{E}[Z(s, t)]\big) ds - \int_t^b Z(t, s) dB_s, \]
  where the focus lies on establishing the existence and uniqueness of adapted M-solutions under appropriate conditions. A key contribution of this work is the development of essential lemmas that provide a rigorous foundation for analyzing the well-posedness of these equations. In addition, we extend our analysis to singular mean-field forward stochastic Volterra integral equations (MF-FSVIEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces, demonstrating their solvability and unique adapted solutions. Finally, we strengthen our theoretical results by applying them to derive stochastic maximum principles, showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed framework. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on mean-field stochastic equations and their applications in control theory and mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>Feller property and convergence for semigroups of time-changed processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a substitute to Feller property for semigroups of time-changed processes; under some conditions this leads to establish sufficient (new) conditions for the semigroups to be Feller. Moreover, given a standard process and a sequence of measures converging vaguely to a final measure, under some assumptions, we establish convergence of the sequence of the semigroups and the resolvents of the corresponding time changed-processes. Some applications are given: convergence of solutions of evolution equations and convergence of finite time distributions.</description>

      <title>Radial conformal welding in Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal work of Sheffield showed that when random surfaces called Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) are conformally welded, the resulting interface is Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). This has been proved for a variety of configurations, and has applications to the scaling limits of random planar maps and the solvability of SLE and Liouville conformal field theory. We extend the theory to the setting where two sides of a canonical three-pointed LQG surface are conformally welded together, resulting in a radial SLE curve which can be described by imaginary geometry.</description>

      <title>Sparse Pseudospectral Shattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices can be unstable under perturbations of their entries. This renders an obstacle to the analysis of numerical algorithms for non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. A recent technique to handle this issue is pseudospectral shattering [BGVKS23], showing that adding a random perturbation to any matrix has a regularizing effect on the stability of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Prior work has analyzed the regularizing effect of dense Gaussian perturbations, where independent noise is added to every entry of a given matrix [BVKS20, BGVKS23, BKMS21, JSS21].
  We show that the same effect can be achieved by adding a sparse random perturbation. In particular, we show that given any $n\times n$ matrix $M$ of polynomially bounded norm: (a) perturbing $O(n\log^2(n))$ random entries of $M$ by adding i.i.d. complex Gaussians yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ and $\log (1/\eta(A))=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ with high probability; (b) perturbing $O(n^{1+\alpha})$ random entries of $M$ for any constant $\alpha&gt;0$ yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ and $\log(1/\eta(A))=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ with high probability. Here, $\kappa_V(A)$ denotes the condition number of the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix $A$ and $\eta(A)$ denotes its minimum eigenvalue gap.
  A key mechanism of the proof is to reduce the study of $\kappa_V(A)$ to control of the pseudospectral area and minimum eigenvalue gap of $A$, which are further reduced to estimates on the least two singular values of shifts of $A$. We obtain the required least singular value estimates via a streamlining of an argument of Tao and Vu [TV07] specialized to the case of sparse complex Gaussian perturbations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic consequence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates logical consequence defined in terms of probability distributions, for a classical propositional language using a standard notion of probability. We examine three distinct probabilistic consequence notions, which we call material consequence, preservation consequence, and symmetric consequence. While material consequence is fully classical for any threshold, preservation consequence and symmetric consequence are subclassical, with only symmetric consequence gradually approaching classical logic at the limit threshold equal to 1. Our results extend earlier results obtained by J. Paris in a SET-FMLA setting to the SET-SET setting, and consider open thresholds beside closed ones. In the SET-SET setting, in particular, they reveal that probability 1 preservation does not yield classical logic, but supervaluationism, and conversely positive probability preservation yields subvaluationism.</description>

      <title>Convex Regularization and Convergence of Policy Gradient Flows under Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon dynamic decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints. Such safety-constrained decision processes are central to applications in autonomous systems, finance, and resource management, where policies must satisfy strict, state-dependent constraints. We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward and parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous state-action spaces. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Our approach leverages recent developments in mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows to model policies as elements of an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with policy updates evolving via gradient flows on the space of parameter distributions. Our main contributions include establishing solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, defining smooth and bounded approximations that facilitate gradient flows, and demonstrating exponential convergence towards global solutions under sufficient regularization. We provide general conditions on regularization functions, encompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case. The results also enable a particle method implementation for practical RL applications. The theoretical insights and convergence guarantees presented here offer a robust framework for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional decision-making problems.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the Diagonal Entries of the Resolvent of a Complex Ginibre Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of eigenvalue distributions in random matrix theory is often conducted by analyzing the resolvent matrix $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) = (z \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} $. The normalized trace of the resolvent, known as the Stieltjes transform $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, converges to a limit $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}(z) $ as the matrix dimension $ N $ grows, which provides the eigenvalue density $ \rho_{\mathbf{M}} $ in the large-$ N $ limit. In the Hermitian case, the distribution of $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, now regarded as a random variable, is explicitly known when $ z $ lies within the limiting spectrum, and it coincides with the distribution of any diagonal entry of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $.
  In this paper, we investigate what becomes of these results when $ \mathbf{M} $ is non-Hermitian. Our main result is the exact computation of the diagonal elements of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $ when $ \mathbf{M} $ is a Ginibre matrix of size $ N $, as well as the high-dimensional limit for different regimes of $ z $, revealing a tail behavior connected to the statistics of the left and right eigenvectors. Interestingly, the limit distribution is stable under inversion, a property previously observed in the symmetric case. We then propose two general conjectures regarding the distribution of the diagonal elements of the resolvent and its normalized trace in the non-Hermitian case, both of which reveal a symmetry under inversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetrically self-similar graphs are an important type of fractal graph. Their Green functions satisfy order one iterative functional equations. We show when the branching number of a generating cell is two, either the graph is a star consisting of finitely many one-sided lines meeting at an origin vertex, in which case the Green function is algebraic, or the Green function is differentially transcendental over $\mathbb{C}(z)$. The proof strategy relies on a recent work of Di Vizio, Fernandes and Mishna. The result adds evidence to a conjecture of Kr\"on and Teufl about the spectrum of this family of graphs.</description>

      <title>The fractional Poisson process and other limit point processes for rare events in infinite ergodic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the process of suitably normalized successive return times to rare events in the setting of infinite-measure preserving dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider small neighborhoods of points whose measure tends to zero. We obtain two types of results. First, we conduct a detailed study of a class of interval maps with a neutral fixed point and we fully characterize the limit processes for all points, highlighting a trichotomy and the emergence of the fractional (possibly compound) Poisson process. This is the first time that these processes have been explicitly identified in this context. Second, we prove an abstract result that offers an explanation for the emergence of the fractional Poisson process, as the unique fixed point of a functional equation, drawing a parallel with the well-established behavior of the Poisson process in finite-measure preserving dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph universality via branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a family of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, we say that a hypergraph $\Gamma$ is $\mathcal{H}$-universal if it contains every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ as a subgraph. For $D, r \in \mathbb{N}$, we construct an $r$-uniform hypergraph with $\Theta\left(n^{r - r/D} \log^{r/D}(n)\right)$ edges which is universal for the family of all $r$-uniform hypergraphs with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $D$. This almost matches a trivial lower bound $\Omega(n^{r - r/D})$ coming from the number of such hypergraphs.
  On a high level, we follow the strategy of Alon and Capalbo used in the graph case, that is $r = 2$. The construction of $\Gamma$ is deterministic and based on a bespoke product of expanders, whereas showing that $\Gamma$ is universal is probabilistic. Two key new ingredients are a decomposition result for hypergraphs of bounded density, based on Edmond's matroid partitioning theorem, and a tail bound for branching random walks on expanders.</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock portfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing the observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large stocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes them independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create a new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM. We fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and connect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory.</description>

      <title>Poissonian pair correlations for dependent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding explicit examples of sequences $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) turns out to be a difficult problem. Therefore, this property is often studied in a random setting. While it is known that i.i.d. sequences of uniformly distributed random variables generically have Poissonian pair correlations, the case of dependent random variables has not been addressed in the literature yet. The present paper is the first contribution dealing with the dependent setting. More specifically, sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus are investigated. We show here that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</description>

      <title>Gaussian multi-target filtering with target dynamics driven by a stochastic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference of a ranked community in a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of detecting or recovering a planted ranked subgraph from a directed graph, an analog for directed graphs of the well-studied planted dense subgraph model. We suppose that, among a set of $n$ items, there is a subset $S$ of $k$ items having a latent ranking in the form of a permutation $\pi$ of $S$, and that we observe a fraction $p$ of pairwise orderings between elements of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ which agree with $\pi$ with probability $\frac{1}{2} + q$ between elements of $S$ and otherwise are uniformly random. Unlike in the planted dense subgraph and planted clique problems where the community $S$ is distinguished by its unusual density of edges, here the community is only distinguished by the unusual consistency of its pairwise orderings. We establish computational and statistical thresholds for both detecting and recovering such a ranked community. In the log-density setting where $k$, $p$, and $q$ all scale as powers of $n$, we establish the exact thresholds in the associated exponents at which detection and recovery become statistically and computationally feasible. These regimes include a rich variety of behaviors, exhibiting both statistical-computational and detection-recovery gaps. We also give finer-grained results for two extreme cases: (1) $p = 1$, $k = n$, and $q$ small, where a full tournament is observed that is weakly correlated with a global ranking, and (2) $p = 1$, $q = \frac{1}{2}$, and $k$ small, where a small "ordered clique" (totally ordered directed subgraph) is planted in a random tournament.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of SDEs with fractional noise and distributional drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of SDEs with singular drifts (including distributions) driven by a fractional Brownian motion. Under the Catellier-Gubinelli condition that imposes the regularity of the drift to be strictly greater than $1-1/(2H)$, we obtain an explicit rate of convergence of a tamed Euler scheme towards the SDE, extending results for bounded drifts. Beyond this regime, when the regularity of the drift is $1-1/(2H)$, we derive a non-explicit rate. As a byproduct, strong well-posedness for these equations is recovered. Proofs use new regularising properties of discrete-time fBm and a new critical Gr\"onwall-type lemma. We present examples and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Following previous investigations by {\"U}st{\"u}nel [22] about the invertibility of some transformations on the Wiener space, we find some entropic conditions under which a random change of time is invertible on the Poisson space. As a consequence, we provide a new construction of Hawkes processes. We also establish a new variational representation of the entropy.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the nonasymptotic properties of the spectral norm of some random matrices with independent columns. In particular, we consider an $m\times n$ random matrix $BA$, where $A$ is an $N\times n$ random matrix with independent mean-zero subexponential entries, and $B$ is an $m\times N$ deterministic matrix. We prove that the $L_{p}$ norm of the spectral norm of $BA$ is upper bounded by $(\sqrt{m}+\sqrt{n})p$ . It is remarkable that this result is independent of the dimension $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disk together with an independent conformal loop ensemble (CLE) with parameter $\kappa=4$. We show that the critical LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent critical LQG disks given the LQG lengths of the loops. We also show that the joint law of the LQG lengths of the loops is described in terms of the jumps of a certain $3/2$-stable process. Our proofs are via a limiting argument based on the analogous statements for $\gamma \in (\sqrt{8/3},2)$ and $\kappa = \gamma^2 \in (8/3,4)$ which were proven by Miller, Sheffield, and Werner (2020). Our results are used in the construction of a coupling of supercritical LQG with CLE$_4$ in another paper by the same authors.</description>

      <title>The Doob transform and the tree behind the forest, with application to near-critical dimers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Doob transform technique enables the study of a killed random walk (KRW) via a random walk (RW) with transition probabilities tilted by a discrete massive harmonic function. The main contribution of this paper is to transfer this powerful technique to statistical mechanics by relating two models, namely random rooted spanning forests (RSF) and random spanning trees (RST), and provide applications. More precisely, our first main theorem explicitly relates models on the level of partition functions, and probability measures, in the case of finite and infinite graphs. Then, in the planar case, we also rely on the dimer model: we introduce a killed and a drifted dimer model, extending to this general framework the models introduced in [Chh12,dT20]. Using Temperley's bijection between RST and dimers, this allows us to relate RSF to dimers and thus extend partially this bijection to RSF. As immediate applications, we give a short and transparent proof of Kenyon's result stating that the spectral curve of RSF is a Harnack curve, and provide a general setting to relate discrete massive holomorphic and harmonic functions. The other important application consists in proving universality of the convergence of the near-critical loop-erased RW, RST and dimer models by extending the results of [Chh12,CW21,HSB22] from the square lattice to any isoradial graphs: we introduce a loop erased RW, RST and dimer model on isoradial discretizations of any simply connected domain and prove convergence in the massive scaling limit towards continuous objects described by a massive version of SLE2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic representation for determinants of Laplace-type operators on vectors bundles over manifolds. Namely, inverse powers of those determinants are written as the expectation of a product of holonomies defined over Brownian loop soups. Our results hold over compact manifolds of dimension 2 or 3, in the presence of a mass or a boundary. We derive a few consequences, including some continuity of these determinants as a function of the operator, and the conformal invariance of the determinant on surfaces.
  This expression allows us to construct the scalar field minimally coupled to a prescribed random smooth gauge field, which we prove obeys the so-called Symanzik identities. Some of these results are continuous analogues of the work of A. Kassel and T. L\'evy in the discrete.</description>

      <title>On the support of solutions to nonlinear stochastic heat equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the strict positivity and the compact support property of solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equation: $$\partial_t u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2}\partial^2_x u(t,x) + \sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x), \quad (t,x)\in \mathbf{R}_+\times\mathbf{R},$$ with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data $u_0$, where $\dot{W}$ is the space-time white noise and $\sigma:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} $ is a continuous function with $\sigma(0)=0$. We prove that (i) if $v/ \sigma(v)$ is sufficiently large near $v=0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ is strictly positive for all $t&gt;0$, and (ii) if $v/\sigma(v)$ is sufficiently small near $v= 0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ has compact support for all $t&gt;0$. These findings extend previous results concerning the strict positivity and the compact support property, which were analyzed only for the case $\sigma(u)\approx u^\gamma$ for $\gamma&gt;0$. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of a solution and the weak comparison principle in case (i).</description>

Abstract: We study the small noise asymptotic for stochastic Burgers equations on $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary condition. We consider the case that the noise is more singular than space-time white noise. We let the noise magnitude $\sqrt{\epsilon} \rightarrow 0$ and the covariance operator $Q_\epsilon$ is convergent to $(-\Delta)^{\frac 1 2}$ and prove a large deviations principle for solutions, uniformly with respect to the initial value of equation. Furthermore, we set $Q_\epsilon$ to be a trace class operator and converge to $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ in a suitable way such that the invariant measures exist. Then, we prove the large deviations principle for the invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar and Li--M\'edard Conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. When focusing on the symmetric $q$-stability, combining this result with our previous bound, we use computer-assisted methods to prove that dictator functions maximize the symmetric $q$-stability for $q=1$ and $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ or for $q\in[1.36,2)$ and all $\rho\in[0,1]$. In other words, we confirm the (balanced) Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ and the (symmetrized) Li--M\'edard conjecture with $q\in[1.36,2)$. We conjecture that dictator functions maximize both the symmetric and asymmetric $\frac{1}{2}$-stability over all balanced Boolean functions. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>

Abstract: We consider Betti numbers of the excursion of a smooth Euclidean Gaussian field restricted to a rectangular window, in the asymptotics where the window grows to R^d . With motivations coming from Topological Data Analysis, we derive a functional Central Limit Theorem where the varying argument is the thresholding parameter, under assumptions of regularity and covariance decay for the field and its derivatives. We also show fixed-level CLTs coming from martingale based techniques inspired from the theory of geometric stabilisation, and limiting non-degenerate variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for the sum of $\epsilon$-independent random variables, extending both the classical and free probability setting. Central to our approach is the use of graphon limits to characterize the limiting distribution, which depends on the asymptotic structure of the underlying graphs governing $\epsilon$-independence. This framework yields a range of exotic limit laws, interpolating between free and classical cases and allowing for mixtures such as free and classical convolutions of the semi-circle and Gaussian distributions. We provide a complete characterization of the limiting law, captured as the distribution of an operator on the full Fock space. We extend our main result to the multivariate setting as well as the non-identically distributed case. The proof provides insights into the combinatorial structure of $\epsilon$-independence, shedding light on a natural connection between the graph of crossings of the partitions involved and the graphon limit of the graphs of $\epsilon$-independence.</description>

      <title>Large systems of symmetrized trapped Brownian Bridges and Schrodinger processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a large system of $N$ Brownian motions in $\R ^d$ fixed on a time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrized initial and terminal conditions, under the influence of a trap potential. Such systems describe systems of bosons at positive temperatures confined in a spatial domain. We describe the large $N$ behavior of the averaged path (that is, their empirical path measure) and its connection with a well known optimal transport problem formulated by Erwin Schr\"odinger. We also explore the asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motions in terms of Large Deviations. In particular, the rate function that governs the mean of occupation measures turns out to be the well-known Donsker-Varadhan rate function. We therefore prove a simple formula for the large $N$ asymptotic of the symmetrized trace of $e^{-\beta \Hcal_N}$, where $\Hcal_N$ is an $N$ particle Hamilton operator in a trap</description>

      <title>From flip processes to dynamical systems on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12272v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of random graph processes, which we call flip processes. Each such process is given by a rule which is a function $\mathcal{R}:\mathcal{H}_k\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_k$ from all labeled $k$-vertex graphs into itself ($k$ is fixed). The process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph $G_0$. In each step, the graph $G_i$ is obtained by sampling $k$ random vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of $G_{i-1}$ and replacing the induced graph $F:=G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]$ by $\mathcal{R}(F)$. This class contains several previously studied processes including the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph process and the triangle removal process. Actually, our definition of flip processes is more general, in that $\mathcal{R}(F)$ is a probability distribution on $\mathcal{H}_k$, thus allowing randomised replacements.
  Given a flip process with a rule $\mathcal{R}$, we construct time-indexed trajectories $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_0\times [0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathcal{W}_0$ in the space of graphons. We prove that for any $T &gt; 0$ starting with a large finite graph $G_0$ which is close to a graphon $W_0$ in the cut norm, with high probability the flip process will stay in a thin sausage around the trajectory $(\Phi(W_0,t))_{t=0}^T$ (after rescaling the time by the square of the order of the graph).
  These graphon trajectories are then studied from the perspective of dynamical systems. Among others topics, we study continuity properties of these trajectories with respect to time and initial graphon, existence and stability of fixed points and speed of convergence (whenever the infinite time limit exists). We give an example of a flip process with a periodic trajectory.</description>

      <title>Connecting classical finite exchangeability to quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchangeability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It allows to model situations where the order of observations does not matter. The classical de Finetti's theorem provides a representation of infinitely exchangeable sequences of random variables as mixtures of independent and identically distributed variables. The quantum de Finetti theorem extends this result to symmetric quantum states on tensor product Hilbert spaces. It is well known that both theorems do not hold for finitely exchangeable sequences. The aim of this work is to investigate two lesser-known representation theorems, which were developed in classical probability theory to extend de Finetti's theorem to finitely exchangeable sequences by using quasi-probabilities and quasi-expectations. With the aid of these theorems, we illustrate how a de Finetti-like representation theorem for finitely exchangeable sequences can be formulated through a mathematical representation which is formally equivalent to quantum theory (with boson-symmetric density matrices). We then show a promising application of this connection to the challenge of defining entanglement for indistinguishable bosons.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities whose coefficient functions do not need to be constant. We also provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of our algorithm. To obtain our main results, we consider a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. We show that the PDE under consideration has a unique viscosity solution which coincides with the first component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Moreover, the gradient of the unique viscosity solution of the PDE exists and coincides with the second component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Furthermore, we also provide a numerical example in up to $300$ dimensions to demonstrate the practical applicability of our multilevel Picard algorithm.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics with estimated nuisance parameters under the null and local alternative hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-sample behavior of non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics of arbitrary degree is investigated under the assumption that their kernel depends on parameters that can be estimated consistently. Mild regularity conditions are provided which guarantee that once properly normalized, such statistics are asymptotically multivariate Gaussian both under the null hypothesis and sequences of local alternatives. The work of Randles (1982, Ann. Statist.) is extended in three ways: the data and the kernel values can be multivariate rather than univariate, the limiting behavior under local alternatives is studied for the first time, and the effect of knowing some of the nuisance parameters is quantified. These results can be applied to a broad range of goodness-of-fit testing contexts, as shown in two specific examples.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem as a geometric probabilistic approach to filtration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane distributed with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature, such as the efficiency of a filter and the emergence of clogging in filtration process. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$ and its analytical difficulty in a general sense. Here, rather than a `short' needle embedded in two-dimensional space, we analytically solve problem versions with needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius embedded in two- and three-dimensional spaces dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to provide a geometric analytical perspective to filtration process, and also extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Stochastic Importation Dynamics and Establishment of Novel Pathogenic Strains using a General Branching Processes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importation and subsequent establishment of novel pathogenic strains in a population is subject to a large degree of uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Mathematical models need to take this stochasticity in the early phase of an outbreak in order to adequately capture the uncertainty in disease forecasts. We propose a general branching process model of disease spread that includes host-level heterogeneity, and that can be straightforwardly tailored to capture the salient aspects of a particular disease outbreak. We combine this with a model of case importation that occurs via an independent marked Poisson process. We use this framework to investigate the impact of different control strategies, particularly on the time to establishment of an invading, exogenous strain, using parameters taken from the literature for COVID-19 as an example. We also demonstrate how to combine our model with a deterministic approximation, such that longer term projections can be generated that still incorporate the uncertainty from the early growth phase of the epidemic. Our approach produces meaningful short- and medium-term projections of the course of a disease outbreak when model parameters are still uncertain and when stochasticity still has a large effect on the population dynamics.</description>

      <title>A note on the topological synchronisation of unimodal maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we complete the analysis carried on in \cite{CGSV} about the topological synchronisation of unimodal maps of the interval coupled in a master-slave configuration, by answering to the questions raised in that paper. Namely, we compute the weak limits of the invariant measure of the coupled system as the coupling strength $k\in\left( 0,1\right) $ tends to $0$ and to $1$ and discuss the uniqueness of the invariant measure of its random dynamical system counterpart, proving that the convergence of the associated Markov chain to its unique stationary measure is geometric.

      <title>Neural Networks-based Random Vortex Methods for Modelling Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach for approximating solutions to the (2D) incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, which is an extension of so called Deep Random Vortex Methods (DRVM), that does not require the knowledge of the Biot--Savart kernel associated to the computational domain. Our algorithm uses a Neural Network (NN), that approximates the vorticity based on a loss function that uses a computationally efficient formulation of the Random Vortex Dynamics. The neural vorticity estimator is then combined with traditional numerical PDE-solvers, which can be considered as a final implicit linear layer of the network, for the Poisson equation to compute the velocity field. The main advantage of our method compared to the standard DRVM and other NN-based numerical algorithms is that it strictly enforces physical properties, such as incompressibility or (no slip) boundary conditions, which might be hard to guarantee otherwise. The approximation abilities of our algorithm, and its capability for incorporating measurement data, are validated by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flexible model for non-stationary Gaussian random fields on hypersurfaces is introduced.The class of random fields on curves and surfaces is characterized by an amplitude spectral density of a second order elliptic differential operator.Sampling is done by a Galerkin--Chebyshev approximation based on the surface finite element method and Chebyshev polynomials. Strong error bounds are shown with convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the approximated random field. Numerical experiments that confirm the convergence rates are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to infer new choices from prior choices using the framework of choice functions, a unifying mathematical framework for decision-making based on sets of preference orders. In particular, we define the natural (most conservative) extension of a given choice assessment to a coherent choice function -- whenever possible -- and use this natural extension to make new choices. We provide a practical algorithm for computing this natural extension and various ways to improve scalability. Finally, we test these algorithms for different types of choice assessments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>
