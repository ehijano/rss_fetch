      <title>Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.</description>

      <title>Boosting superconductivity in ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films via nanofaceted substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the doping level is fixed during synthesis, hence the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike in 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of Underlayer Induced Charge Carrier Substitution on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder, yet yields the highest TC. This indicates that in the Ti40V60 alloys, a moderate amount of disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations (inherent to the alloy system) induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the film with V under-layer and the film without under-layer, and the much smaller coherence length (~6.2 nm) as compared to the film thickness (25 nm), confirm the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.</description>

      <title>Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moir\'e superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</description>
