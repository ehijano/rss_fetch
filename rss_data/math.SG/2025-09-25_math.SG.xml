      <title>Reduction principles for proper actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the core of a proper action by a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$, extending the construction for $G$ compact by Skjelbred and Straume. Moreover, we show that many properties of a proper $G$-action on $M$ are determined by the action of a group $G'$ on the corresponding core $_cM$. We say that such properties admit a reduction principle. In particular, we prove that a proper isometric $G$-action on $M$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar) if and only if the $G'$-action on $_cM$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar). In the case of a proper action by syplectomorphisms on a symplectic manifold, we show that a reduction principle holds for coisotropic and infinitesimally almost homogeneous actions. We further study the coisotropic condition for the case of a proper Hamiltonian action and its relation with the symplectic stratification described by Lermann and Bates. In particular, we obtain several characterizations for coisotropic actions, some of which extend known results for the action of a compact group of holomorphic automorphisms on a compact K\"ahler manifold obtained by Huckleberry and Wurzbacher. Finally, we study some applications of the core construction for the action of a compact Lie group on a K\"ahler manifold by holomorphic isometries.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Morse Theory and Witten Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>Hopf orbits and the first ECH capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider dynamically convex star-shaped domains in a symplectic vector space of dimension $4$. For such a domain, a ``Hopf orbit'' is a closed characteristic in the boundary which is unknotted and has self-linking number $-1$. We show that the minimum action among Hopf orbits exists and defines a symplectic capacity for dynamically convex star-shaped domains. We further show that this capacity agrees with the first ECH capacity for such domains. Combined with a result of Edtmair, this implies that for dynamically convex star-shaped domains in four dimensions, the first ECH capacity agrees with the cylinder capacity. This also provides a method to show that the first ECH capacity of a dynamically convex star-shaped domain satisfies the axioms of a normalized symplectic capacity without any need for Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Delzant type theorem for torus-equivariantly embedded toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous work, we study the moment polytope of the closure of the complex subtorus orbit in a symplectic toric manifold associated to an affine subspace when the closure is a smooth complex submanifold. In this paper, we clarify the condition for nonsingularity of the closure of the codimension one complex subtorus orbit in terms of polytopes. The main result is a generalization of Delzant theorem.</description>

      <title>Spectral selectors on strongly orderable contact manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the spectral selectors introduced by the author for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds satisfy algebraic properties analogous to those of the spectral selectors for lens spaces constructed by Allais, Sandon and the author using Givental's nonlinear Maslov index. As applications, first we establish a contact big fiber theorem for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds as well as for lens spaces. Second, when the Reeb flow is periodic, we construct a stably unbounded conjugation invariant norm on the contactomorphism group universal cover. Moreover, when all its orbits have the same period, we show that the Reeb flow is a geodesic for the discriminant and oscillation norms of Colin-Sandon. Finally, we generalize a theorem of Albers-Fuchs-Merry stating that non-orderability implies the Weinstein conjecture.</description>

      <title>The KSBA moduli space of stable log Calabi-Yau surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every irreducible component of the coarse Koll\'ar-Shepherd-Barron and Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of stable log Calabi--Yau surfaces admits a finite cover by a projective toric variety. This verifies a conjecture of Hacking-Keel-Yu. The proof combines tools from log smooth deformation theory, the minimal model program, punctured log Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Non-toric brane webs, Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study webs of 5-branes with 7-branes in Type IIB string theory from a geometric perspective. Mathematically, a web of 5-branes with 7-branes is a tropical curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with focus-focus singularities introduced. To any such a web $W$, we attach a log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with a line bundle $L$. We then describe supersymmetric webs, which are webs defining 5d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), in terms of the geometry of $(Y,D,L)$. We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs called ``consistent webs", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric web can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using birational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an algorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon. Moreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric construction of the mirror $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a non-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain how to derive explicit equations for $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ using scattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or equivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>
