      <title>Efficient Data Management for IPFS dApps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inefficient data management has been the Achilles heel of blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps). An off-chain storage layer, which lies between the application and the blockchain layers, can improve space efficiency and data availability with erasure codes and decentralized maintenance. This paper presents two fundamental components of such storage layer designed and implemented for the IPFS network. The IPFS Community is a component built on top of the IPFS network that encodes and decodes data before uploading to the network. Since data is encoded with alpha entanglement codes, the solution requires less storage space than the native IPFS solution which replicates data by pinning content with the IPFS Cluster. To detect and repair failures in a timely manner, we introduce the monitoring and repair component. This novel component is activated by any node and distributes the load of repairs among various nodes. These two components are implemented as pluggable modules, and can, therefore, be easily migrated to other distributed file systems by adjusting the connector component.</description>

      <title>Timely Communications for Remote Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the impact of data freshness on remote inference systems, where a pre-trained neural network infers a time-varying target (e.g., the locations of vehicles and pedestrians) based on features (e.g., video frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., a camera). One might expect that the performance of a remote inference system degrades monotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic analysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can be closely approximated as a Markov chain, whereas it is not true if the data sequence is far from Markovian. Hence, the inference error is a function of Age of Information (AoI), where the function could be non-monotonic. To minimize the inference error in real-time, we propose a new "selection-from-buffer" model for sending the features, which is more general than the "generate-at-will" model used in earlier studies. In addition, we design low-complexity scheduling policies to improve inference performance. For single-source, single-channel systems, we provide an optimal scheduling policy. In multi-source, multi-channel systems, the scheduling problem becomes a multi-action restless multi-armed bandit problem. For this setting, we design a new scheduling policy by integrating Whittle index-based source selection and duality-based feature selection-from-buffer algorithms. This new scheduling policy is proven to be asymptotically optimal. These scheduling results hold for minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic). Data-driven evaluations demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Integration of Mixture of Experts and Multimodal Generative AI in Internet of Vehicles: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) can enhance the cognitive, reasoning, and planning capabilities of intelligent modules in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) by synthesizing augmented datasets, completing sensor data, and making sequential decisions. In addition, the mixture of experts (MoE) can enable the distributed and collaborative execution of AI models without performance degradation between connected vehicles. In this survey, we explore the integration of MoE and GAI to enable Artificial General Intelligence in IoV, which can enable the realization of full autonomy for IoV with minimal human supervision and applicability in a wide range of mobility scenarios, including environment monitoring, traffic management, and autonomous driving. In particular, we present the fundamentals of GAI, MoE, and their interplay applications in IoV. Furthermore, we discuss the potential integration of MoE and GAI in IoV, including distributed perception and monitoring, collaborative decision-making and planning, and generative modeling and simulation. Finally, we present several potential research directions for facilitating the integration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamics of Data Transmission in 5G Networks: A Conceptual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This conceptual analysis examines the dynamics of data transmission in 5G networks. It addresses various aspects of sending data from cameras and LiDARs installed on a remote-controlled ferry to a land-based control center. The range of topics includes all stages of video and LiDAR data processing from acquisition and encoding to final decoding, all aspects of their transmission and reception via the WebRTC protocol, and all possible types of network problems such as handovers or congestion that could affect the quality of experience for end-users. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the key aspects of the data transmission. These include simulation-based reproducible runs and real-world experiments conducted using open-source solutions we developed: "Gymir5G" - an OMNeT++-based 5G simulation and "GstWebRTCApp" - a GStreamer-based application for adaptive control of media streams over the WebRTC protocol. One of the goals of this study is to formulate the bandwidth and latency requirements for reliable real-time communication and to estimate their approximate values. This goal was achieved through simulation-based experiments involving docking maneuvers in the Bay of Kiel, Germany. The final latency for the entire data processing pipeline was also estimated during the real tests. In addition, a series of simulation-based experiments showed the impact of key WebRTC features and demonstrated the effectiveness of the WebRTC protocol, while the conducted video codec comparison showed that the hardware-accelerated H.264 codec is the best. Finally, the research addresses the topic of adaptive communication, where the traditional congestion avoidance and deep reinforcement learning approaches were analyzed. The comparison in a sandbox scenario shows that the AI-based solution outperforms the WebRTC baseline GCC algorithm in terms of data rates, latency, and packet loss.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Service Placement for IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant expansion in the Internet of Things (IoT), with a growing number of devices being connected to the internet. This has led to an increase in data collection and analysis as well as the development of new technologies and applications. The rise of IoT has also brought about new challenges, such as security concerns and energy efficiency. This study investigates a layered IoT architecture that combines fog and cloud computing, aiming to assess the impact of service placement on energy efficiency. Through simulations, we analyse energy use across Access Fog, Metro Fog, and Cloud Data Centre layers for different IoT request volumes. Findings indicate that Access Fog is optimal for single requests, while Metro Fog efficiently manages higher demands from multiple devices. The study emphasizes the need for adaptive service deployment, responsive to network load variations, to improve energy efficiency. Hence, we propose the implementation of dynamic service placement strategies within Internet of Things (IoT) environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet service provider industry is currently experiencing intense competition as companies strive to provide top-notch services to their customers. Providers are introducing cutting-edge technologies to enhance service quality, understanding that their survival depends on the level of service they offer. However, evaluating service quality is a complex task. A crucial aspect of this evaluation lies in understanding user experience, which significantly impacts the success and reputation of a service or product. Ensuring a seamless and positive user experience is essential for attracting and retaining customers. To date, much effort has been devoted to developing tools for measuring Quality of Experience (QoE), which incorporate both subjective and objective criteria. These tools, available in closed and open-source formats, are accessible to organizations and contribute to improving user experience quality. This review article delves into recent research and initiatives aimed at creating frameworks for assessing user QoE. It also explores the integration of machine learning algorithms to enhance these tools for future advancements. Additionally, the article examines current challenges and envisions future directions in the development of these measurement tools.</description>

      <title>TRACTOR: Traffic Analysis and Classification Tool for Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular networks promise remarkable advancements in bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The emergence of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) represents a pivotal direction for the evolution of cellular networks, inherently supporting machine learning (ML) for network operation control. Within this framework, RAN Intelligence Controllers (RICs) from one provider can employ ML models developed by third-party vendors through the acquisition of key performance indicators (KPIs) from geographically distant base stations or user equipment (UE). Yet, the development of ML models hinges on the availability of realistic and robust datasets. In this study, we embark on a two-fold journey. First, we collect a comprehensive 5G dataset, harnessing real-world cell phones across diverse applications, locations, and mobility scenarios. Next, we replicate this traffic within a full-stack srsRAN-based O-RAN framework on Colosseum, the world's largest radio frequency (RF) emulator. This process yields a robust and O-RAN compliant KPI dataset mirroring real-world conditions. We illustrate how such a dataset can fuel the training of ML models and facilitate the deployment of xApps for traffic slice classification by introducing a CNN based classifier that achieves accuracy $&gt;95\%$ offline and $92\%$ online. To accelerate research in this domain, we provide open-source access to our toolchain and supplementary utilities, empowering the broader research community to expedite the creation of realistic and O-RAN compliant datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of cellular networks will be characterized by openness, intelligence, virtualization, and distributed computing. The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) framework represents a significant leap toward realizing these ideals, with prototype deployments taking place in both academic and industrial domains. While it holds the potential to disrupt the established vendor lock-ins, Open RAN's disaggregated nature raises critical security concerns. Safeguarding data and securing interfaces must be integral to Open RAN's design, demanding meticulous analysis of cost/benefit tradeoffs.
  In this paper, we embark on the first comprehensive investigation into the impact of encryption on two pivotal Open RAN interfaces: the E2 interface, connecting the base station with a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller, and the Open Fronthaul, connecting the Radio Unit to the Distributed Unit. Our study leverages a full-stack O-RAN ALLIANCE compliant implementation within the Colosseum network emulator and a production-ready Open RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular network. This research contributes quantitative insights into the latency introduced and throughput reduction stemming from using various encryption protocols. Furthermore, we present four fundamental principles for constructing security by design within Open RAN systems, offering a roadmap for navigating the intricate landscape of Open RAN security.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity Assessment of the Polar Bluetooth Low Energy Heart-rate Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications among wearable and implantable devices implement the information exchange around the human body. Wireless body area network (WBAN) technology enables non-invasive applications in our daily lives. Wireless connected devices improve the quality of many services, and they make procedures easier. On the other hand, they open up large attack surfaces and introduces potential security vulnerabilities. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a low-power protocol widely used in wireless personal area networks (WPANs). This paper analyzes the security vulnerabilities of a BLE heart-rate sensor. By observing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) variations, it is possible to detect anomalies in the BLE connection. The case-study shows that an attacker can easily intercept and manipulate the data transmitted between the mobile app and the BLE device. With this research, the author would raise awareness about the security of the heart-rate information that we can receive from our wireless body sensors.</description>

      <title>Securing Hybrid Wireless Body Area Networks (HyWBAN): Advancements in Semantic Communications and Jamming Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores novel strategies to strengthen the security of Hybrid Wireless Body Area Networks (HyWBANs), essential in smart healthcare and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Recognizing the vulnerability of HyWBAN to sophisticated cyber-attacks, we propose an innovative combination of semantic communications and jamming receivers. This dual-layered security mechanism protects against unauthorized access and data breaches, particularly in scenarios involving in-body to on-body communication channels. We conduct comprehensive laboratory measurements to understand hybrid (radio and optical) communication propagation through biological tissues and utilize these insights to refine a dataset for training a Deep Learning (DL) model. These models, in turn, generate semantic concepts linked to cryptographic keys for enhanced data confidentiality and integrity using a jamming receiver. The proposed model demonstrates a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional cryptographic methods, like Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), especially when supplemented with jamming. Our approach addresses the primary security concerns and sets the baseline for future secure biomedical communication systems advancements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted trustworthiness for the Quantum Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device redundancy is one of the most well-known mechanisms in distributed systems to increase the overall system fault tolerance and, consequently, trustworthiness. Existing algorithms in this regard aim to exchange a significant number of messages among nodes to identify and agree which communication links or nodes are faulty. This approach greatly degrades the performance of those wireless communication networks exposed to limited available bandwidth and/or energy consumption due to messages flooding. Lately, quantum-assisted mechanisms have been envisaged as an appealing alternative to improve the performance in this kind of communication networks and have been shown to obtain levels of performance close to the ones achieved in ideal conditions. The purpose of this paper is to further explore this approach by using super-additivity and superposed quantum trajectories in quantum Internet to obtain a higher system trustworthiness. More specifically, the wireless communication network that supports the permafrost telemetry service for the Antarctica together with five operational modes (three of them using classical techniques and two of them using quantum-assisted mechanisms) have been simulated. Obtained results show that the new quantum-assisted mechanisms can increase the system performance by up to a 28%.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Video Conferencing via Optimized Packet Routing and Reordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the face of rising global demand for video meetings, managing traffic across geographically distributed (geo-distributed) data centers presents a significant challenge due to the dynamic and limited nature of inter-DC network performance. Facing these issues, this paper introduces two novel techniques, VCRoute and WMJitter, to optimize the performance of geo-distributed video conferencing systems. VCRoute is a routing method designed for audio data packets of video conferences. It treats the routing problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit issue, and utilizes a tailored Thompson Sampling algorithm for resolution. Unlike traditional approaches, VCRoute considers transmitting latency and its variance simultaneously by using Thompson Sampling algorithm, which leads to effective end-to-end latency optimization. In conjunction with VCRoute, we present WMJitter, a watermark-based mechanism for managing network jitter, which can further reduce the end-to-end delay and keep an improved balance between latency and loss rate. Evaluations based on real geo-distributed network performance demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of VCRoute and WMJitter, offering robust solutions for optimizing video conferencing systems in geo-distributed settings.</description>

Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

Abstract: Ambiguity performance, which indicates the maximum detectable region for target parameter estimation, is critical to radar sensor design. Driven by ambiguity performance requirements of bi-static sensing, we propose design criteria for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) reference signal (RS) patterns. The design not only reduces ambiguities in both time delay and Doppler shift domains under different types of sensing algorithms, but also reduces resource overhead for integrated comunication and sensing. With minimal modifications of post-FFT processing for current RS patterns, guard interval is extended beyond conventional cyclic prefix (CP), while maintaining inter-symbol-interference-(ISI)-free delay estimation. For standard-resolution sensing algorithms, a staggering offset of a linear slope that is relatively prime to the RS comb size is suggested. As for high-resolution sensing algorithms, necessary and sufficient conditions of comb RS staggering offsets, plus new patterns synthesized therefrom, are derived for the corresponding achievable ambiguity performance. Furthermore, we generalize the RS pattern design criterion for high-resolution sensing algorithms to irregular forms, which minimizes number of resource elements (REs) for associated algorithms to eliminate all side peaks. Starting from staggered comb pattern in current positioning RS, our generalized design eventually removes any regular form for ultimate flexibility. Overall, the proposed techniques are promising to extend the ISI- and ambiguity-free range of distance and speed estimates for radar sensing.</description>

      <title>Staggered Comb Reference Signal Design for Integrated Communication and Sensing</title>

Abstract: Ambiguity performance is a critical criterion in radar sensor design, which indicates the ambiguities arising from multiple target estimation and detection. We considered a requirement-driven selection of OFDM reference signal (RS) patterns based on ambiguity performances for bi-static sensing in integrated communication and sensing with minimal modifications of current RSs. An RS pattern with a staggering offset of a linear slope that is relatively prime to the RS comb size is suggested for standard-resolution sensing algorithms to obtain the best ambiguity performances. Moreover, an extended guard interval design is proposed to increase the maximum time delay, that is inter-symbol interference (ISI) free using post-FFT sensing algorithms. The proposed techniques are promising to extend the distance and speed without ambiguities and ISI for sensing.</description>

      <title>FlagVNE: A Flexible and Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</description>
