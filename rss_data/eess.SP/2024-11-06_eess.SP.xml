      <title>Revisiting the Fraunhofer and Fresnel Boundaries for Phased Array Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the characterization of near-field propagation regions for phased array antennas, with a particular focus on the propagation boundaries defined by Fraunhofer and Fresnel distances. These distances, which serve as critical boundaries for understanding signal propagation behavior, have been extensively studied and characterized in the literature for single-element antennas. However, the direct application of these results to phased arrays, a common practice in the field, is argued to be invalid and non-exact. This work calls for a deeper understanding of near-field propagation to accurately characterize such boundaries around phased array antennas. More specifically, for a single-element antenna, the Fraunhofer distance is $d^{\mathrm{F}}=2D^2 \sin^2(\theta)/\lambda$ where $D$ represents the largest dimension of the antenna, $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\theta$ denotes the observation angle. We show that for phased arrays, $d^{\mathrm{F}}$ experiences a fourfold increase (i.e., $d^{\mathrm{F}}=8D^2 \sin^2(\theta)/\lambda$) provided that $|\theta-\frac{\pi}{2}|&gt;\theta^F$ (which holds for most practical scenarios), where $\theta^F$ is a small angle whose value depends on the number of array elements, and for the case $|\theta-\frac{\pi}{2}|\leq\theta^F$, we have $d^{\mathrm{F}}\in[2D^2/\lambda,8D^2\cos^2(\theta^F)/\lambda]$, where the precise value is obtained according to some square polynomial function $\widetilde{F}(\theta)$. Besides, we also prove that the Fresnel distance for phased array antennas is given by $d^{\mathrm{N}}=1.75 \sqrt{{D^3}/{\lambda}}$ which is $\sqrt{8}$ times greater than the corresponding distance for a conventional single-element antenna with the same dimension.</description>

      <title>A Study on Characterization of Near-Field Sub-Regions For Phased-Array Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize three near-field sub-regions for phased array antennas by elaborating on the boundaries {\it Fraunhofer}, {\it radial-focal}, and {\it non-radiating} distances. The {\it Fraunhofer distance} which is the boundary between near and far field has been well studied in the literature on the principal axis (PA) of single-element center-fed antennas, where PA denotes the axis perpendicular to the antenna surface passing from the antenna center. The results are also valid for phased arrays if the PA coincides with the boresight, which is not commonly the case in practice. In this work, we completely characterize the Fraunhofer distance by considering various angles between the PA and the boresight. For the {\it radial-focal distance}, below which beamfocusing is feasible in the radial domain, a formal characterization of the corresponding region based on the general model of near-field channels (GNC) is missing in the literature. We investigate this and elaborate that the maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) beamforming based on the simple uniform spherical wave (USW) channel model results in a radial gap between the achieved and the desired focal points. While the gap vanishes when the array size $N$ becomes sufficiently large, we propose a practical algorithm to remove this gap in the non-asymptotic case when $N$ is not very large. Finally, the {\it non-radiating} distance, below which the reactive power dominates active power, has been studied in the literature for single-element antennas. We analytically explore this for phased arrays and show how different excitation phases of the antenna array impact it. We also clarify some misconceptions about the non-radiating and Fresnel distances prevailing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding for FDD MISO Systems via Minorization Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to robust precoder design based on a minorization maximization technique that optimizes a surrogate function of the achievable spectral efficiency. The presented method accounts for channel estimation errors during the optimization process and is, hence, robust in the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Additionally, the design method is adapted such that the need for a line search to satisfy the power constraint is eliminated, that significantly accelerates the precoder computation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust precoding method is competitive with weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding, in particular, under imperfect CSI scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Framework for Bearing Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately diagnosing bearing faults is crucial for maintaining the efficient operation of rotating machinery. However, traditional diagnosis methods face challenges due to the diversification of application environments, including cross-condition adaptability, small-sample learning difficulties, and cross-dataset generalization. These challenges have hindered the effectiveness and limited the application of existing approaches. Large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for improving the generalization of diagnosis models. However, the integration of LLMs with traditional diagnosis techniques for optimal generalization remains underexplored. This paper proposed an LLM-based bearing fault diagnosis framework to tackle these challenges. First, a signal feature quantification method was put forward to address the issue of extracting semantic information from vibration data, which integrated time and frequency domain feature extraction based on a statistical analysis framework. This method textualized time-series data, aiming to efficiently learn cross-condition and small-sample common features through concise feature selection. Fine-tuning methods based on LoRA and QLoRA were employed to enhance the generalization capability of LLMs in analyzing vibration data features. In addition, the two innovations (textualizing vibration features and fine-tuning pre-trained models) were validated by single-dataset cross-condition and cross-dataset transfer experiment with complete and limited data. The results demonstrated the ability of the proposed framework to perform three types of generalization tasks simultaneously. Trained cross-dataset models got approximately a 10% improvement in accuracy, proving the adaptability of LLMs to input patterns. Ultimately, the results effectively enhance the generalization capability and fill the research gap in using LLMs for bearing fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communications With Low Resolution DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize spectrum and thereby save cost and power. At the higher end of the spectrum, ISAC systems operate at wideband using large antenna arrays to meet the stringent demands for high-resolution sensing and enhanced communications capacity. On the other hand, the overall design should satisfy energy-efficiency and hardware constraints such as operating on low resolution components for a practical scenario. Therefore, this paper presents the design of Hybrid ANalog and Digital BeAmformers with Low resoLution (HANDBALL) digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We introduce a greedy-search-based approach to design the analog beamformers for multi-user multi-target ISAC scenario. Then, the quantization distortion is taken into account in order to design the baseband beamformer with low resolution DACs. We evaluated performance of the proposed HANDBALL technique in terms of both spectral efficiency and sensing beampattern, providing a satisfactory sensing and communication performance for both one-bit and few-bit designs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Temporal Analysis for Failure Prediction in Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing models struggle to predict nonlinear behavior during extreme weather conditions. This study proposes a multi-scale temporal analysis for failure prediction in energy systems using PMU data. The model integrates multi-scale analysis with machine learning to capture both short-term and long-term behavior. PMU data lacks labeled states despite logged failure records, making it difficult to distinguish between normal and disturbance conditions. We address this through: (1) Extracting domain features from PMU time series data; (2) Applying multi-scale windows (30s, 60s, 180s) for pattern detection; (3) Using Recursive Feature Elimination to identify key features; (4) Training multiple machine learning models. Key contributions: Identifying significant features across multi-scale windows; Demonstrating LightGBM's superior performance (0.896 precision); Showing multi-scale analysis outperforms single-window models (0.841). Our work focuses on weather-related failures, with plans to extend to equipment failure and lightning events.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization in the Constant Envelope MIMO Downlink with the RZF Precoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feeding power amplifiers (PAs) with constant envelope (CE) signals is an effective way to reduce the power consumption in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The nonlinear distortion caused by CE signaling must be mitigated by means of signal processing to improve the achievable sum rates. To this purpose, many linear and nonlinear precoding techniques have been developed for the CE MIMO downlink. The vast majority of these CE precoding techniques do not include a power allocation scheme, which is indispensable to achieve adequate performances in the downlink with channel gain imbalances between users. In this paper, we present two algorithms to produce a power allocation scheme for regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding in CE MIMO downlink. Both techniques are based on transforming the CE quantized MIMO downlink to an approximately equivalent system of parallel single-input-single-output (SISO) channels. The first technique is proven to solve the sum rate maximization problem in the approximate system optimally, whereas the second technique obtains the local maximum with lower complexity. We also extend another state-of-the-art quantization aware sum rate maximization algorithm with linear precoding to the CE downlink. Numerical results illustrate significant gains for the performance of the RZF precoder when the CE quantization is taken into account in a power allocation. Another key numerical result is that the proposed RZF techniques achieve almost the identical performance so that the one with lower computational complexity is chosen as the main method. Results also show that the proposed RZF precoding schemes perform at least as good as the state-of-the-art method with an advantage that the main RZF method has significantly lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Newtonized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for High-Resolution Target Detection in Sparse OFDM ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a technology paradigm that combines sensing capabilities with communication functionalities in a single device or system. In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink, ISAC can provide enhanced safety by allowing vehicles to not only communicate with one another but also sense the surrounding environment by using sidelink signals. In ISAC-capable V2X sidelink, the random resource allocation results in an unstructured and sparse distribution of time and frequency resources in the received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) grid, leading to degraded radar detection performance when processed using the conventional 2D-FFT method. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a high-resolution off-grid radar target detection algorithm irrespective of the OFDM grid structure. The proposed method utilizes the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm to effectively detect weak targets masked by the sidelobes of stronger ones and accurately estimates off-grid range and velocity parameters with minimal resources through Newton refinements. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NOMP-based target detection algorithm compared to existing compressed sensing (CS) methods in terms of detection probability, resolution, and accuracy. Additionally, experimental validation is performed using a bi-static radar setup in a semi-anechoic chamber. The measurement results validate the simulation findings, showing that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances target detection and parameter estimation accuracy in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Statistical Radar Cross Section Characterization for Indoor Factory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we statistically analyze the radar cross section (RCS) of different test targets present in an indoor factory (InF) scenario specified by 3rd Generation Partnership Project considering bistatic configuration. The test targets that we consider are drones, humans, quadruped robot and a robotic arm. We consider two drones of different sizes and five human subjects for RCS characterization. For the drones, we measure the RCS when they are are flying over a given point and while they are rotating over the same point. For human subjects, we measure the RCS while standing still, sitting still and walking. For quadruped robot and robotic arm, we consider a continuous random motion emulating different tasks which they are supposed to perfom in typical InF scenario. We employ different distributions, such as Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Rician, Weibull, Rayleigh and Exponential to fit the measurement data. From the statistical analysis, we gather that Lognormal distribution can fit all the considered targets in the InF scenario.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Dynamic Neural Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent applications beyond the network edge, coupled with the need for sustainable operation, are driving the seamless integration of deep learning (DL) algorithms into energy-limited, and even energy-harvesting end-devices. However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy sources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the energy requirements for inference and causing significant performance degradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an on-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and finite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time execution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural networks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier predictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be employed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy storage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of integrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We derive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and -agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the advantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a lightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show that, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware control schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their energy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve even higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited relative to the energy consumption of the inference model.</description>

      <title>A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively Homogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for parallel positively homogeneous neural networks--a class of neural networks whose input-output map decomposes as the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples of such networks include matrix factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, tensor factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and more. Our general framework is based on linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to a closely related convex optimization problem over prediction functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization analysis in the convex space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and its non-convex counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models ranging from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear networks, two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with the network width.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised detection and classification of heartbeats using the dissimilarity matrix in PCG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed system consists of a two-stage cascade. The first stage performs a rough heartbeat detection while the second stage refines the previous one, improving the temporal localization and also classifying the heartbeats into types S1 and S2. The first contribution is a novel approach that combines the dissimilarity matrix with the frame-level spectral divergence to locate heartbeats using the repetitiveness shown by the heart sounds and the temporal relationships between the intervals defined by the events S1/S2 and non-S1/S2 (systole and diastole). The second contribution is a verification-correction-classification process based on a sliding window that allows the preservation of the temporal structure of the cardiac cycle in order to be applied in the heart sound classification. The proposed method has been assessed using the open access databases PASCAL, CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram and an additional sound mixing procedure considering both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and different kinds of clinical ambient noises from a commercial database. The proposed method provides the best detection/classification performance in realistic scenarios where the presence of cardiac anomalies as well as different types of clinical environmental noises are active in the PCG signal. Of note, the promising modelling of the temporal structures of the heart provided by the dissimilarity matrix together with the frame-level spectral divergence, as well as the removal of a significant number of spurious heart events and recovery of missing heart events, both corrected by the proposed verification-correction-classification algorithm, suggest that our proposal is a successful tool to be applied in heart segmentation.</description>

      <title>User Centric Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current studies on semantic communications mainly focus on efficiently extracting semantic information to reduce bandwidth usage between a transmitter and a user. Although significant process has been made in the semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter side along, without considering the user's actual requirements. As a result, critical information that is of primary concern to the user may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the user, as all received information is irrelevant to the user's interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a user centric semantic communication system, where the user sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter can understand the user's requests for semantic information and extract the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We solve this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed user centric semantic communication system.</description>

      <title>Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes tensor-based channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication networks. We exploit the inherent geometrical structure of the Terahertz propagation channel, including the antenna array geometries at the base station, the RIS, and the user equipment to design a tensor-based channel estimator, referred to as the higher-dimensional rank-one approximations (HDR) method. By exploiting the geometrical structure of the combined base station-RIS-user equipment channel, the proposed HDR estimator recasts parametric channel estimation as a single sixth-order rank-one tensor approximation problem, which can be efficiently solved using higher-order singular value decomposition to deliver parallel estimates of each channel component vector. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides significantly more accurate parameter estimates than competing state-of-the-art tensor-based RIS channel estimation, Khatri-Rao factorization, and least squares methods. For higher-rank channels, the HDR method shows similar spectral efficiency compared to its competitors while having similar computational complexity to the classical least squares estimator.</description>

      <title>Proactive Blockage Prediction for UAV assisted Handover in Future Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future wireless communication applications demand seamless connectivity, higher throughput, and low latency, for which the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band is considered a potential technology. Nevertheless, line-of-sight (LoS) is often mandatory for mmWave band communication, and it renders these waves sensitive to sudden changes in the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the LoS link for a reliable connection. One such technique to maintain LoS is using proactive handover (HO). However, proactive HO is challenging, requiring continuous information about the surrounding wireless network to anticipate potential blockage. This paper presents a proactive blockage prediction mechanism where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used as the base station for HO. The proposed scheme uses computer vision (CV) to obtain potential blocking objects, user speed, and location. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the system is evaluated using a publicly available dataset for blockage prediction. The study integrates scenarios from Vision-based Wireless (ViWi) and UAV channel modeling, generating wireless data samples relevant to UAVs. The antenna modeling on the UAV end incorporates a polarization-matched scenario to optimize signal reception. The results demonstrate that UAV-assisted Handover not only ensures seamless connectivity but also enhances overall network performance by 20%. This research contributes to the advancement of proactive blockage mitigation strategies in wireless networks, showcasing the potential of UAVs as dynamic and adaptable base stations.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling in real-time faces remarkable challenge due to the complexities of traditional methods such as ray tracing and field measurements. AI-based techniques have emerged to address these limitations, offering rapid, precise predictions of channel properties through ground truth data. This paper introduces an innovative approach to real-time, high-fidelity propagation modeling through advanced deep learning. Our model integrates 3D geographical data and rough propagation estimates to generate precise path gain predictions. By positioning the transmitter centrally, we simplify the model and enhance its computational efficiency, making it amenable to larger scenarios. Our approach achieves a normalized Root Mean Squared Error of less than 0.035 dB over a 37,210 square meter area, processing in just 46 ms on a GPU and 183 ms on a CPU. This performance significantly surpasses traditional high-fidelity ray tracing methods, which require approximately three orders of magnitude more time. Additionally, the model's adaptability to real-world data highlights its potential to revolutionize wireless network design and optimization, through enabling real-time creation of adaptive digital twins of real-world wireless scenarios in dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is the problem of solving a linear system of equations, where the right-hand-side vector is known only up to a permutation. In this work, we study fields of rational functions related to symmetric polynomials and their images under a linear projection of the variables; as a consequence, we establish that the solution to an n-dimensional unlabeled sensing problem with generic data can be obtained as the unique solution to a system of n + 1 polynomial equations of degrees 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 in n unknowns. Besides the new theoretical insights, this development offers the potential for scaling up algebraic unlabeled sensing algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral decomposition of graph adjacency matrices is an essential ingredient in the design of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques. When the adjacency matrix has multi-dimensional eigenspaces, it is desirable to base GSP constructions on a particular eigenbasis that better reflects the graph's symmetries. In this paper, we provide an explicit and detailed representation-theoretic account for the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a weighted Cayley graph. Our method applies to all weighted Cayley graphs, regardless of whether they are quasi-Abelian, and offers detailed descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors derived from the coefficient functions of the representations of the underlying group. Next, we turn our attention to constructing frames on Cayley graphs. Frames are overcomplete spanning sets that ensure stable and potentially redundant systems for signal reconstruction. We use our proposed eigenbases to build frames that are suitable for developing signal processing on Cayley graphs. These are the Frobenius--Schur frames and Cayley frames, for which we provide a characterization and a practical recipe for their construction.</description>

      <title>Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of ADHD using EEG has attracted the attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. However, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, the persistence image method is employed to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 78.27%, 80.62%, and 75.63%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>

Abstract: While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.
