      <title>Human Skin Permittivity Characterization for Mobile Handset Evaluation at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript proposes a method for characterizing the complex permittivity of the human finger skin based on an open-ended waveguide covered with a thin dielectric sheet at sub-terahertz frequencies. The measurement system is initially analyzed through full-wave simulations with a detailed finger model. Next, the model is simplified by replacing the finger with an infinite sheet of human skin to calculate the forward electromagnetic problem related to the permittivity characterization. Following this, a radial basis network is employed to train the inverse problem solver. Finally, the complex permittivities of finger skins are characterized for 10 volunteers. The variations in complex relative permittivity across different individuals and skin regions are analyzed at 140~GHz, revealing a maximum deviation of $\pm 0.7$ for both the real and imaginary parts. Repeated measurements at the same location on the finger demonstrate good repeatability with a relative estimation uncertainty $&lt;\pm 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Characterization for Mid-band ELAA Systems: Sounding, Parameter Estimation, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G communication will greatly benefit from using extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) and new mid-band spectrums (7-24 GHz). These techniques require a thorough exploration of the challenges and potentials of the associated near-field (NF) phenomena. It is crucial to develop accurate NF channel models that include spherical wave propagation and spatial non-stationarity (SnS). However, channel measurement campaigns for mid-band ELAA systems have rarely been reported in the state-of-the-art. To this end, this work develops a channel sounder dedicated to mid-band ELAA systems based on a distributed modular vector network analyzer incorporating radio-over-fiber (RoF), phase compensation, and virtual antenna array schemes. This novel channel-sounding testbed based on off-the-shelf VNA has the potential to enable large-scale experimentation due to its generic and easy-accessible nature. The main challenges and solutions for developing NF channel models for mid-band ELAA systems are discussed, including channel sounders, multipath parameter estimation algorithms, and channel modeling frameworks. Besides, the study reports a measurement campaign in an indoor scenario using a 720-element virtual uniform circular array ELAA operating at {16-20} GHz, highlighting the presence of spherical wavefronts and spatial non-stationary effects. The effectiveness of the proposed near-field channel parameter estimator and channel modeling framework is also demonstrated using the measurement data.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Learning Framework for Tracking Users in RIS-aided Multi-band ISAC Systems with Sparse Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is pivotal for 6G communications and is boosted by the rapid development of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Using the channel state information (CSI) across multiple frequency bands, RIS-aided multi-band ISAC systems can potentially track users' positions with high precision. Though tracking with CSI is desirable as no communication overheads are incurred, it faces challenges due to the multi-modalities of CSI samples, irregular and asynchronous data traffic, and sparse labeled data for learning the tracking function. This paper proposes the X2Track framework, where we model the tracking function by a hierarchical architecture, jointly utilizing multi-modal CSI indicators across multiple bands, and optimize it in a cross-domain manner, tackling the sparsity of labeled data for the target deployment environment (namely, target domain) by adapting the knowledge learned from another environment (namely, source domain). Under X2Track, we design an efficient deep learning algorithm to minimize tracking errors, based on transformer neural networks and adversarial learning techniques. Simulation results verify that X2Track achieves decimeter-level axial tracking errors even under scarce UL data traffic and strong interference conditions and can adapt to diverse deployment environments with fewer than 5% training data, or equivalently, 5 minutes of UE tracks, being labeled.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a cornerstone technology for the forth upcoming sixth generation era, seamlessly incorporating sensing functionality into wireless networks as a native capability. The main challenges in efficient ISAC are constituted by its limited sensing and communication coverage, as well as severe inter-cell interference. Network-level ISAC relying on multi-cell cooperation is capable of effectively expanding both the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) coverage and of providing extra degrees of freedom (DoF) for realizing increased integration gains between S&amp;C. In this work, we provide new considerations for ISAC networks, including new metrics, the optimization of the DoF, cooperation regimes, and highlight new S&amp;C tradeoffs. Then, we discuss a suite of cooperative S&amp;C architectures both at the task, as well as data, and signal levels. Furthermore, the interplay between S&amp;C at the network level is investigated and promising research directions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Uplink/Downlink Decoupled Access in Cellular-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper firstly develops an analytical framework to investigate the performance of uplink (UL) / downlink (DL) decoupled access in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks, in which a vehicle's UL/DL can be connected to different macro/small base stations (MBSs/SBSs) separately. Using the stochastic geometry analytical tool, the UL/DL decoupled access C-V2X is modeled as a Cox process, and we obtain the following theoretical results, i.e., 1) the probability of different UL/DL joint association cases i.e., both the UL and DL are associated with the different MBSs or SBSs, or they are associated with different types of BSs; 2) the distance distribution of a vehicle to its serving BSs in each case; 3) the spectral efficiency of UL/DL in each case; and 4) the UL/DL coverage probability of MBS/SBS. The analyses reveal the insights and performance gain of UL/DL decoupled access. Through extensive simulations, \textcolor{black}{the accuracy of the proposed analytical framework is validated.} Both the analytical and simulation results show that UL/DL decoupled access can improve spectral efficiency. The theoretical results can be directly used for estimating the statistical performance of a UL/DL decoupled access C-V2X network.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in AI-Driven Decision Making for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS): A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in technology have led to the emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which seamlessly integrate the cyber and physical domains in various sectors such as agriculture, autonomous systems, and healthcare. This integration presents opportunities for enhanced efficiency and automation through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). However, the complexity of CPS brings forth challenges related to transparency, bias, and trust in AI-enabled decision-making processes. This research explores the significance of AI and ML in enabling CPS in these domains and addresses the challenges associated with interpreting and trusting AI systems within CPS. Specifically, the role of explainable AI (XAI) in enhancing trustworthiness and reliability in AI-enabled decision-making processes is discussed. Key challenges such as transparency, security, and privacy are identified, along with the necessity of building trust through transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Property Sensing in ISAC with Multiple Base Stations: Algorithm, Pilot Design,and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has opened up numerous game-changing opportunities for future wireless systems. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot signals to sense the electromagnetic (EM) property of the target and thus identify the materials of the target. Specifically, we first establish an EM wave propagation model with Maxwell equations, where the EM property of the target is captured by a closed-form expression of the channel. We then build the mathematical model for the relative permittivity and conductivity distribution (RPCD) within a predetermined region of interest shared by multiple base stations (BSs). Based on the EM wave propagation model, we propose an EM property sensing method, in which the RPCD can be reconstructed from compressive sensing techniques that exploits the joint sparsity structure of the EM property vector. We then develop a fusion algorithm to combine data from multiple BSs, which can enhance the reconstruction accuracy of EM property by efficiently integrating diverse measurements. Moreover, the fusion is performed at the feature level of RPCD and features low transmission overhead. We further design the pilot signals that can minimize the mutual coherence of the equivalent channels and enhance the diversity of incident EM wave patterns. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving high-quality RPCD reconstruction and accurate material classification.</description>

      <title>Performance of UAV-based Cell-free mMIMO ISAC Networks: Tethered vs. Mobile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The employment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aligned with multistatic sensing in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems can provide remarkable performance gains in sensing, by taking advantage of the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architecture. Under these considerations, in this paper, the achievable sensing signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) of a cell-free mMIMO ISAC UAV-based network is evaluated for two different deployments of UAVs, namely, mobile and tethered. In both scenarios, a transmit precoder that jointly optimizes the sensing and communication requirements subjected to power constraints is designed. Specifically, for the scenario with mobile UAVs, beyond the transmit precoding, we also optimize the position of the transmit UAVs through particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results show that, although tethered UAVs have a more efficient power allocation, the proposed position control algorithm for the mobile UAVs can achieve a superior gain in terms of sensing SINR.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Residual Useful Lifetime Prediction for Assets with Uncertain Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial prognostics focuses on utilizing degradation signals to forecast and continually update the residual useful life of complex engineering systems. However, existing prognostic models for systems with multiple failure modes face several challenges in real-world applications, including overlapping degradation signals from multiple components, the presence of unlabeled historical data, and the similarity of signals across different failure modes. To tackle these issues, this research introduces two prognostic models that integrate the mixture (log)-location-scale distribution with deep learning. This integration facilitates the modeling of overlapping degradation signals, eliminates the need for explicit failure mode identification, and utilizes deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships between degradation signals and residual useful lifetimes. Numerical studies validate the superior performance of these proposed models compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Complex Permittivity Characterization of Low-Loss Dielectric Slabs at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel method for characterizing the permittivities of low-loss dielectric slabs in sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies, specifically above 100 GHz using a quasi-optical system. The algorithm is introduced with detailed derivations, and the measurement sensitivity is analyzed through simulations. Subsequently, the method's validity is established via simulations, demonstrating high accuracy (error 0.1% for the loss tangent) for a 30 mm thick plate material and relatively lower accuracy (error &lt;5% for the loss tangent) for a 6 mm thick plate material. Notably, this accuracy surpasses that of the approach presented in [1] when the same window width is used to extract signals. Furthermore, a comparison between the permittivities of plexiglass with a 30 mm thickness characterized by the proposed method and the approach in [1] reveals a maximum difference in the dielectric constant of 0.011 and in loss tangent of 0.00071 from 140 to 220 GHz. Finally, the relative complex permittivities of plexiglass at 142.86 GHz obtained by both methods are compared with the reference values provided in [2], exhibiting differences of 0.06 in the dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Adaptive Channel Contention for Mobile Delay-Sensitive Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive channel contention mechanism to optimize the queuing performance of a distributed millimeter wave (mmWave) uplink system with the capability of environment and mobility sensing. The mobile agents determine their back-off timer parameters according to their local knowledge of the uplink queue lengths, channel quality, and future channel statistics, where the channel prediction relies on the environment and mobility sensing. The optimization of queuing performance with this adaptive channel contention mechanism is formulated as a decentralized multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Although the channel contention actions are determined locally at the mobile agents, the optimization of local channel contention policies of all mobile agents is conducted in a centralized manner according to the system statistics before the scheduling. In the solution, the local policies are approximated by analytical models, and the optimization of their parameters becomes a stochastic optimization problem along an adaptive Markov chain. An unbiased gradient estimation is proposed so that the local policies can be optimized efficiently via the stochastic gradient descent method. It is demonstrated by simulation that the proposed gradient estimation is significantly more efficient in optimization than the existing methods, e.g., simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA).</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming of RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: An Alternating Inner Product Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a general discrete $\ell_p$-norm maximization problem, with the power enhancement at steering directions through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as an instance. We propose a mathematically concise iterative framework composed of alternating inner product maximizations, well-suited for addressing $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norm maximizations with either discrete or continuous uni-modular variable constraints. The iteration is proven to be monotonically non-decreasing. Moreover, this framework exhibits a distinctive capability to mitigate performance degradation due to discrete quantization, establishing it as the first post-rounding lifting approach applicable to any algorithm intended for the continuous solution. Additionally, as an integral component of the alternating iterations framework, we present a divide-and-sort (DaS) method to tackle the discrete inner product maximization problem. In the realm of $\ell_\infty$-norm maximization with discrete uni-modular constraints, the DaS ensures the identification of the global optimum with polynomial search complexity. We validate the effectiveness of the alternating inner product maximization framework in beamforming through RISs using both numerical experiments and field trials on prototypes. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher power enhancement and outperforms other competitors. Finally, we show that discrete phase configurations with moderate quantization bits (e.g., 4-bit) exhibit comparable performance to continuous configurations in terms of power gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where communication and radar sensing employ the co-waveform design. Specifically, we focus on the beamformer design and antenna position configuration to realize a higher communication rate while guaranteeing the minimum radar probing power. Different from existing beamformer algorithms, we propose an efficient proximal distance algorithm (PDA) to solve the multiuser sum-rate maximization problem with radar sensing constraint to obtain the closed-form beamforming vector. In addition, we develop an extrapolated projected gradient (EPG) algorithm to obtain a better antenna location configuration for FA to enhance the ISAC performance. Numerical results show that the considered FA-assisted ISAC system enjoys a higher sum-rate by the proposed algorithm, compared with that in existing non-FA ISAC systems.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider the realm of covariance matrices in machine learning, particularly focusing on computing Fr\'echet means on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, commonly referred to as Karcher or geometric means. Such means are leveraged in numerous machine-learning tasks. Relying on advanced statistical tools, we introduce a random matrix theory-based method that estimates Fr\'echet means, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with low sample support and a high number of matrices to average. Our experimental evaluation, involving both synthetic and real-world EEG and hyperspectral datasets, shows that we largely outperform state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop and analyze a Gradient Descent (GD) based solution, called Alternating GD and Minimization (AltGDmin), for efficiently solving the low rank matrix completion (LRMC) in a federated setting. LRMC involves recovering an $n \times q$ rank-$r$ matrix $\Xstar$ from a subset of its entries when $r \ll \min(n,q)$. Our theoretical guarantees (iteration and sample complexity bounds) imply that AltGDmin is the most communication-efficient solution in a federated setting, is one of the fastest, and has the second best sample complexity among all iterative solutions to LRMC. In addition, we also prove two important corollaries. (a) We provide a guarantee for AltGDmin for solving the noisy LRMC problem. (b) We show how our lemmas can be used to provide an improved sample complexity guarantee for AltMin, which is the fastest centralized solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a computational solution that enables continuous cardiac monitoring through cross-modality inference of electrocardiogram (ECG). While some smartwatches now allow users to obtain a 30-second ECG test by tapping a built-in bio-sensor, these short-term ECG tests often miss intermittent and asymptomatic abnormalities of cardiac functions. It is also infeasible to expect persistently active user participation for long-term continuous cardiac monitoring in order to capture these and other types of cardiac abnormalities. To alleviate the need for continuous user attention and active participation, we design a lightweight neural network that infers ECG from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal sensed at the skin surface by a wearable optical sensor. We also develop a diagnosis-oriented training strategy to enable the neural network to capture the pathological features of ECG, aiming to increase the utility of reconstructed ECG signals for screening cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We also leverage model interpretation to obtain insights from data-driven models, for example, to reveal some associations between CVDs and ECG/PPG and to demonstrate how the neural network copes with motion artifacts in the ambulatory application. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the feasibility of inferring ECG from PPG, achieving a high fidelity of ECG reconstruction with only about 40K parameters.</description>

      <title>Compressing Sign Information in DCT-based Image Coding via Deep Sign Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressing the sign information of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients is an intractable problem in image coding schemes due to the equiprobable characteristics of the signs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an efficient compression method for the sign information called "sign retrieval." This method is inspired by phase retrieval, which is a classical signal restoration problem of finding the phase information of discrete Fourier transform coefficients from their magnitudes. The sign information of all DCT coefficients is excluded from a bitstream at the encoder and is complemented at the decoder through our sign retrieval method. We show through experiments that our method outperforms previous ones in terms of the bit amount for the signs and computation cost. Our method, implemented in Python language, is available from https://github.com/ctsutake/dsr.</description>

      <title>The Multi-cluster Two-Wave Fading Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and characterize the Multi-cluster Two-Wave (MTW) fading model, which generalizes \textit{both} the Durgin's Two-Wave with Diffuse Power (TWDP) and the $\kappa$-$\mu$ models under a common umbrella. The MTW model consists of an arbitrary number of clusters of waves each of which may include one or two dominant (specular) components. The chief probability functions of the MTW fading model are obtained, including the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function and the generalized moment-generating function. \textcolor{black}{The proposed model is empirically validated using channel measurements in the sub-THz band and} a number of applications are exemplified, including the outage probability in noise-limited and interference-limited scenarios and the energy detection probability. %Exact expressions for the outage capacity are also obtained. A composite Inverse Gamma (IG)/MTW model is also investigated, thus extending the proposed propagation model to include shadowing.</description>

      <title>ASF-YOLO: A Novel YOLO Model with Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion for Cell Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Attentional Scale Sequence Fusion based You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework (ASF-YOLO) which combines spatial and scale features for accurate and fast cell instance segmentation. Built on the YOLO segmentation framework, we employ the Scale Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) module to enhance the multi-scale information extraction capability of the network, and the Triple Feature Encoder (TFE) module to fuse feature maps of different scales to increase detailed information. We further introduce a Channel and Position Attention Mechanism (CPAM) to integrate both the SSFF and TPE modules, which focus on informative channels and spatial position-related small objects for improved detection and segmentation performance. Experimental validations on two cell datasets show remarkable segmentation accuracy and speed of the proposed ASF-YOLO model. It achieves a box mAP of 0.91, mask mAP of 0.887, and an inference speed of 47.3 FPS on the 2018 Data Science Bowl dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
