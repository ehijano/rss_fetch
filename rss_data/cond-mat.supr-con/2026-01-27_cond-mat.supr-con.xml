      <title>Nonvolatile electric switching of critical current in cross-bar superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting (SC) diodes are key passive building blocks for future SC electronics. However, realizing their active counterparts is essential for functional logic. Here, we demonstrate deterministic nonvolatile electrical switching of the critical current ($I_\text{c}$) in overlap crossbar SC junctions. By applying a minimal perpendicular magnetic field ($H_\text{z}$), $I_\text{c}$ is modulated by a factor of four with a large switching efficiency of 60\%, achieved at a significantly reduced excitation current density of $5\times10^5$~A/cm$^2$. We also uncover anomalous behaviors: an electrically switchable critical temperature and a non-monotonic $I_\text{c}$-$H_\textit{z}$ response. These observations are interpreted in terms of unique asymmetry involving isolated vortex injection, configuration and repulsion inherent to the junction geometry. Our device provides a scalable, low-power alternative to complex SQUID-based architectures, paving the way for high-density SC integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Charge and Spin Density Waves in Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Revealed by $^{139}$La NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting transitions in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has highlighted the pivotal role of density wave (DW) orders in nickelate superconductors. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the superconducting state, it is essential to elucidate the nature of the DW order. In this study, we utilized $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to investigate the charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders in both single-crystal and polycrystalline La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Near $T_{\rm{DW}} \approx 133$ K, an abrupt change in both the linewidth and frequency of the La(2) site in the single-crystal sample provides compelling evidence for a first-order-like phase transition. The pronounced broadening of the NQR lines indicates the incommensurate nature of the DW order. Furthermore, the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$ exhibits a strong enhancement at $T_{\rm{DW}}$, indicating the strong spin fluctuations above the first-order DW transition. These observations suggest an intricate interplay between incommensurate CDW and SDW orders. Our findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms of the DW state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and establish an essential framework for exploring the interplay between DW and superconducting phases in nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Wave functions for the regular pentagonal two-dimensional quantum box and thin microstrip antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general wave functions for the two-dimensional regular pentagonal quantum box and thin microstrip antenna are derived. As for the square, equilateral triangular, and circular disk-shaped boxes and antennas, there are two quantum nunbers $n$ and $m$. In those cases, $n\ge1 $ and $m\ge 0$ are both unlimited non-negative integers of any value. For the regular pentagon, only $n\ge1 $ is an unlimited positive quantum number, but $m_{\rm min}\le m\le 5$, where $m_{\rm min}=0$ for the pentagonal microstrip antenna with Neumann boundary conditions and $m_{\rm min}=1$ for the pentagonal quantum box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Color-coded pictures of the wave functions for the regular pentagonal quantum box and microstrip antenna are presented for all allowed $m$ values and for $1\le n\le 2$ and for the microstrip antenna for all allowed $m$ values and $n=3$.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of vortex liquid droplets in the iron pnictide superconductor CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ at $0.5T$_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Plasmon assisted superconductivity in LiTi$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine $GW$ plus extended dynamical mean field theory ($GW$+EDMFT) with the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT) framework to study the electronic properties of LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for the density of states, mass enhancement, Sommerfeld coefficient and superconducting $T_c$, if the dynamical nature of the screened Coulomb interaction is taken into account. Our results show that the coupling to collective charge fluctuations (plasmons) plays an important role in the pairing mechanism and explains the remarkably high $T_c$ of this moderately correlated spinel compound.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity under pressure in the two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion metal CeSiI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18476v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Exotic vortex states at high magnetic fields in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to strong electronic correlations, high-temperature superconductivity always exhibits intricate intertwinement with various competing electronic orders in phase diagrams, such as spin/charge density waves (S/CDWs). In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal fluctuations.At low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter.</description>

      <title>Conductance switching and nonequilibrium phase coexistence in superconductors with intermediate bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting systems may display different types of nonequilibrium states depending on the specific constraints imposed for measurement. We probe current-voltage relations of three-dimensional superconducting films by allowing finite voltages to develop across their length. Our experiments reveal sharp features of negative differential conductance which highlight the validity of the principle of minimum entropy production at the critical current transition. We have observed dissipative states with resistances intermediate between those of superconducting and normal phases at zero applied magnetic field, indicating a phenomenon of phase coexistence under nonequilibrium conditions. The features of steady states reported here are not accessible in conventional transport experiments with current-biasing methods.</description>

      <title>Giant Resonant Enhancement of Photoinduced Dynamical Cooper Pairing, far above $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe experiments performed on $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ have unveiled both optical and transport signatures of metastable light-induced superconductivity up to room temperature, far above $T_c$. Recent experiments have uncovered that excitation in the vicinity of $50 ~\textrm{meV}$ enables the observation of high temperature light-induced superconductivity at significantly lower fluences. Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism.</description>

      <title>Detecting the full photoemission cone from laser-based ARPES experiments by leveraging deflector technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$\pi$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2\pi$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.</description>

      <title>Catalog of phonon emergent particles and chiral phonons: Symmetry-based classification and materials database investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality and topology are fundamental and ubiquitous in nature. Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: http://phonon.nju.edu.cn, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by the symmetry of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining superconducting and magnetic materials is a promising path to generate exotic interface subgap states. In this regard, altermagnetism is particularly interesting because it lifts spin degeneracy while providing tailored anisotropy of spin splittings. Here, we investigate the realization and control of subgap states by using the symmetry contrast between altermagnetic fields and unconventional pairings. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands as the Bogoliubov Fermi surface, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting devices.</description>

Abstract: We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</description>

      <title>Current Flow in Topological Insulator Josephson Junctions due to Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link>

Abstract: Recent experiments on planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, e.g., in Corbino geometry, have reported low-temperature nonzero Josephson currents in states with integer fluxoid (flux) induced in the junction by a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect was discussed in connection with Majorana zero modes localized in Josephson vortices of such junctions. Here, we provide an explanation for this phenomenon, attributing it to imperfections. We focus on the ``atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit, we can associate the nonvanishing critical current with the irregularities, e.g., in the junction's width. The low-temperature contribution to the current is provided by the bound states with low but nonzero energy. We also propose clear experimental tests based on microwave spectroscopy, revealing distinctive selection rules for vortex transitions.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-belt superconducting quantum computer</title>

Abstract: The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing magnetic coupling in lumped element superconducting resonators for molecular spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00857</link>

Abstract: We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to $100$ kHz and collective couplings exceeding $10$ MHz. The resonators interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single wire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process gives access to the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a $50$ nm wide constriction at the inductor center, single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by sideband frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</description>
