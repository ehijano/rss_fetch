      <title>Breaching the Bottleneck: Evolutionary Transition from Reward-Driven Learning to Reward-Agnostic Domain-Adapted Learning in Neuromodulated Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced biological intelligence learns efficiently from an information-rich stream of stimulus information, even when feedback on behaviour quality is sparse or absent. Such learning exploits implicit assumptions about task domains. We refer to such learning as Domain-Adapted Learning (DAL). In contrast, AI learning algorithms rely on explicit externally provided measures of behaviour quality to acquire fit behaviour. This imposes an information bottleneck that precludes learning from diverse non-reward stimulus information, limiting learning efficiency. We consider the question of how biological evolution circumvents this bottleneck to produce DAL. We propose that species first evolve the ability to learn from reward signals, providing inefficient (bottlenecked) but broad adaptivity. From there, integration of non-reward information into the learning process can proceed via gradual accumulation of biases induced by such information on specific task domains. This scenario provides a biologically plausible pathway towards bottleneck-free, domain-adapted learning. Focusing on the second phase of this scenario, we set up a population of NNs with reward-driven learning modelled as Reinforcement Learning (A2C), and allow evolution to improve learning efficiency by integrating non-reward information into the learning process using a neuromodulatory update mechanism. On a navigation task in continuous 2D space, evolved DAL agents show a 300-fold increase in learning speed compared to pure RL agents. Evolution is found to eliminate reliance on reward information altogether, allowing DAL agents to learn from non-reward information exclusively, using local neuromodulation-based connection weight updates only.</description>

      <title>Near-Tight Runtime Guarantees for Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in the field of mathematical runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the performance of MOEAs on discrete many-objective problems is little understood. In particular, the few existing bounds for the SEMO, global SEMO, and SMS-EMOA algorithms on classic benchmarks are all roughly quadratic in the size of the Pareto front. In this work, we prove near-tight runtime guarantees for these three algorithms on the four most common benchmark problems OneMinMax, CountingOnesCountingZeros, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump, and this for arbitrary numbers of objectives. Our bounds depend only linearly on the Pareto front size, showing that these MOEAs on these benchmarks cope much better with many objectives than what previous works suggested. Our bounds are tight apart from small polynomial factors in the number of objectives and length of bitstrings. This is the first time that such tight bounds are proven for many-objective uses of these MOEAs. While it is known that such results cannot hold for the NSGA-II, we do show that our bounds, via a recent structural result, transfer to the NSGA-III algorithm.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symbolic Regression for Heuristic Design in the Traveling Thief Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Traveling Thief Problem is an NP-hard combination of the well known traveling salesman and knapsack packing problems. In this paper, we use symbolic regression to learn useful features of near-optimal packing plans, which we then use to design efficient metaheuristic genetic algorithms for the traveling thief algorithm. By using symbolic regression again to initialize the metaheuristic GA with near-optimal individuals, we are able to design a fast, interpretable, and effective packing initialization scheme. Comparisons against previous initialization schemes validates our algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Items or Relations -- what do Artificial Neural Networks learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learned after being successfully trained to solve a task - the set of training items or the relations between them? This question is difficult to answer for modern applied ANNs because of their enormous size and complexity. Therefore, here we consider a low-dimensional network and a simple task, i.e., the network has to reproduce a set of training items identically. We construct the family of solutions analytically and use standard learning algorithms to obtain numerical solutions. These numerical solutions differ depending on the optimization algorithm and the weight initialization and are shown to be particular members of the family of analytical solutions. In this simple setting, we observe that the general structure of the network weights represents the training set's symmetry group, i.e., the relations between training items. As a consequence, linear networks generalize, i.e., reproduce items that were not part of the training set but are consistent with the symmetry of the training set. In contrast, non-linear networks tend to learn individual training items and show associative memory. At the same time, their ability to generalize is limited. A higher degree of generalization is obtained for networks whose activation function contains a linear regime, such as tanh. Our results suggest ANN's ability to generalize - instead of learning items - could be improved by generating a sufficiently big set of elementary operations to represent relations and strongly depends on the applied non-linearity.</description>

      <title>Sup3r: A Semi-Supervised Algorithm for increasing Sparsity, Stability, and Separability in Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, a neuromorphic approach for feature extraction from event data, presents promising capabilities but faces challenges in accuracy and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we introduce Sup3r, a Semi-Supervised algorithm aimed at addressing these challenges. Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks. It enables end-to-end online training of HOTS networks replacing external classifiers, by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events. Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting. Preliminary results on N-MNIST demonstrate that Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized Artificial Neural Networks trained with back-propagation. This work showcases the potential of Sup3r to advance the capabilities of HOTS networks, offering a promising avenue for neuromorphic algorithms in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>ESC: Evolutionary Stitched Camera Calibration in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel end-to-end approach for estimating extrinsic parameters of cameras in multi-camera setups on real-life sports fields. We identify the source of significant calibration errors in multi-camera environments and address the limitations of existing calibration methods, particularly the disparity between theoretical models and actual sports field characteristics. We propose the Evolutionary Stitched Camera calibration (ESC) algorithm to bridge this gap. It consists of image segmentation followed by evolutionary optimization of a novel loss function, providing a unified and accurate multi-camera calibration solution with high visual fidelity. The outcome allows the creation of virtual stitched views from multiple video sources, being as important for practical applications as numerical accuracy. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-life football fields with varying physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Loss Function for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function that defines the discrepancy between the predicted model output and the target value. The selection of the loss function is crucial to achieve task-specific behaviour and highly influences the capability of the model. A variety of loss functions have been proposed for a wide range of tasks affecting training and model performance. For classification tasks, the cross entropy is the de-facto standard and usually the first choice. Here, we try to experimentally challenge the well-known loss functions, including cross entropy (CE) loss, by utilizing the genetic programming (GP) approach, a population-based evolutionary algorithm. GP constructs loss functions from a set of operators and leaf nodes and these functions are repeatedly recombined and mutated to find an optimal structure. Experiments were carried out on different small-sized datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Fashion-MNIST using an Inception model. The 5 best functions found were evaluated for different model architectures on a set of standard datasets ranging from 2 to 102 classes and very different sizes. One function, denoted as Next Generation Loss (NGL), clearly stood out showing same or better performance for all tested datasets compared to CE. To evaluate the NGL function on a large-scale dataset, we tested its performance on the Imagenet-1k dataset where it showed improved top-1 accuracy compared to models trained with identical settings and other losses. Finally, the NGL was trained on a segmentation downstream task for Pascal VOC 2012 and COCO-Stuff164k datasets improving the underlying model performance.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Diversity Optimization on the Multi-objective (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros) Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity optimization is the class of optimization problems, in which we aim at finding a diverse set of good solutions. One of the frequently used approaches to solve such problems is to use evolutionary algorithms which evolve a desired diverse population. This approach is called evolutionary diversity optimization (EDO).
  In this paper, we analyse EDO on a 3-objective function LOTZ$_k$, which is a modification of the 2-objective benchmark function (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros). We prove that the GSEMO computes a set of all Pareto-optimal solutions in $O(kn^3)$ expected iterations. We also analyze the runtime of the GSEMO$_D$ (a modification of the GSEMO for diversity optimization) until it finds a population with the best possible diversity for two different diversity measures, the total imbalance and the sorted imbalances vector. For the first measure we show that the GSEMO$_D$ optimizes it asymptotically faster than it finds a Pareto-optimal population, in $O(kn^2\log(n))$ expected iterations, and for the second measure we show an upper bound of $O(k^2n^3\log(n))$ expected iterations. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study, which shows a very similar behavior for both diversity measures that is close to the theory predictions.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight and Transferable Design for Robust LEGO Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lego is a well-known platform for prototyping pixelized objects. However, robotic Lego prototyping (i.e., manipulating Lego bricks) is challenging due to the tight connections and accuracy requirements. This paper investigates safe and efficient robotic Lego manipulation. In particular, this paper reduces the complexity of the manipulation by hardware-software co-design. An end-of-arm tool (EOAT) is designed, which reduces the problem dimension and allows large industrial robots to manipulate small Lego bricks. In addition, this paper uses evolution strategy to optimize the robot motion for Lego manipulation. Experiments demonstrate that the EOAT can reliably manipulate Lego bricks and the learning framework can effectively and safely improve the manipulation performance to a 100% success rate. The co-design is deployed to multiple robots (i.e., FANUC LR-mate 200id/7L and Yaskawa GP4) to demonstrate its generalizability and transferability. In the end, we show that the proposed solution enables sustainable robotic Lego prototyping, in which the robot can repeatedly assemble and disassemble different prototypes.</description>
