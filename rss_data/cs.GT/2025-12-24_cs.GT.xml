      <title>Maximizing the Egalitarian Welfare in Friends and Enemies Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of maximizing egalitarian welfare in Friends and Enemies Games -- a subclass of hedonic games in which every agent partitions other agents into friends and enemies. We investigate two classic scenarios proposed in the literature, namely, Friends Appreciation ($\mathsf{FA}$) and Enemies Aversion ($\mathsf{EA}$): in the former, each agent primarily cares about the number of friends in her coalition, breaking ties based on the number of enemies, while in the latter, the opposite is true. For $\mathsf{EA}$, we show that our objective is hard to approximate within $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$, for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$, and provide a polynomial-time $(n-1)$-approximation. For $\mathsf{FA}$, we obtain an NP-hardness result and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a ratio of $2-\Theta(\frac{1}{n})$ when every agent has at least two friends; however, if some agent has at most one friend, its approximation ratio deteriorates to $n/2$. We recover the $2-\Theta(\frac{1}{n})$ approximation ratio for two important variants: when randomization is allowed and when the friendship relationship is symmetric. Additionally, for both $\mathsf{EA}$ and $\mathsf{FA}$ we identify special cases where the optimal egalitarian partition can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Relu and softplus neural nets as zero-sum turn-based games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Distributed Load Balancing: Static and Dynamic Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in job scheduling, queuing networks, and load balancing in cyber-physical systems, we develop and analyze a game-theoretic framework to balance the load among servers in static and dynamic settings. In these applications, jobs/tasks are held by selfish entities that do not want to coordinate with each other, yet the goal is to balance the load among servers in a distributed manner. First, we provide a static game formulation in which each player holds a job with a specific processing requirement and wants to schedule it fractionally among a set of heterogeneous servers to minimize its average processing time. We show that this static game is a potential game with a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). In particular, the best-response dynamics converge to such an NE after $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of players. Additionally, we bound the price of anarchy (PoA) of the static game in terms of game parameters. We then extend our results to a dynamic game setting, where jobs arrive and get processed, and players observe the load on the servers to decide how to schedule their jobs. In this setting, we show that if the players update their strategies using dynamic best-response, the system eventually becomes fully load-balanced and the players' strategies converge to the pure NE of the static game. In particular, we show that the convergence time scales only polynomially with respect to the game parameters. Finally, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Budget Aggregation with Star-Shaped Preference Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating distributions, such as budget proposals, into a collective distribution. An ideal aggregation mechanism would be Pareto efficient, strategyproof, and fair. Most previous work assumes that agents evaluate budgets according to the $\ell_1$ distance to their ideal budget. We investigate and compare different models from the larger class of star-shaped utility functions - a multi-dimensional generalization of single-peaked preferences. For the case of two alternatives, we extend existing results by proving that under very general assumptions, the uniform phantom mechanism is the only strategyproof mechanism that satisfies proportionality - a minimal notion of fairness introduced by Freeman et al. (2021). Moving to the case of more than two alternatives, we establish sweeping impossibilities for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ disutilities: no mechanism satisfies efficiency, strategyproofness, and proportionality. We then propose a new kind of star-shaped utilities based on evaluating budgets by the ratios of shares between a given budget and an ideal budget. For these utilities, efficiency, strategyproofness, and fairness become compatible. In particular, we prove that the mechanism that maximizes the Nash product of individual utilities is characterized by group-strategyproofness and a core-based fairness condition.</description>

      <title>Undergraduate Course Allocation through Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prevailing methods of course allocation at undergraduate institutions involve reserving seats to give priority to designated groups of students. We introduce a competitive equilibrium-based mechanism that assigns course seats using student preferences and course priorities. This mechanism satisfies approximate notions of stability, efficiency, envy-freeness, and strategy-proofness. We evaluate its performance relative to a mechanism widely used in practice using preferences estimated from university data. Our empirical findings demonstrate an improvement in student satisfaction and allocation fairness. The number of students who envy another student of weakly lower priority declines by 8 percent, or roughly 500 students.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mechanism Design: Jointly Eliciting Preferences and Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mechanism design in environments where agents have private preferences and private information about a common payoff-relevant state. In such settings with multi-dimensional types, standard mechanisms fail to implement efficient allocations. We address this limitation by proposing data-driven mechanisms that condition transfers on additional post-allocation information, modeled as an estimator of the payoff-relevant state. Our mechanisms extend the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves framework. We show they achieve exact implementation in posterior equilibrium when the state is fully revealed or utilities are affine in an unbiased estimator. With a consistent estimator, they achieve approximate implementation that converges to exact implementation as the estimator converges, and we provide bounds on the convergence rate. We demonstrate applications to digital advertising auctions and AI shopping assistants, where user engagement naturally reveals relevant information, and to procurement auctions with consumer spot markets, where additional information arises from a pricing game played by the same agents.</description>
