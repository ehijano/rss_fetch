      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a C*-algebra. We provide exact sequences to compute the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the C*-algebra in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group C*-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Complete computations are then performed for the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups and many others. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of Xin Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>Measures of noncompactness in Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a countably generated Hilbert $C^*$-module $\mathcal M$ over a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$. There is a measure of noncompactness $\lambda$ defined, roughly as the distance from finitely generated projective submodules, which is independent of any topology. We compare $\lambda$ to the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness with respect to the family of seminorms that induce a topology recently iontroduced by Troitsky, denoted by $\chi^*$. We obtain $\lambda\equiv\chi^*$. Related inequalities involving other known measures of noncompactness, e.g. Kuratowski and Istr\u{a}\c{t}escu are laso obtained as well as some related results on adjontable operators.</description>

      <title>A generalization of K-theory to operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of K-theory to operator systems. Motivated by spectral truncations of noncommutative spaces described by $C^*$-algebras and inspired by the realization of the K-theory of a $C^*$-algebra as the Witt group of hermitian forms, we introduce new operator system invariants indexed by the corresponding matrix size. A direct system is constructed whose direct limit possesses a semigroup structure, and we define the $K_0$-group as the corresponding Grothendieck group. This is an invariant of unital operator systems, and, more generally, an invariant up to Morita equivalence of operator systems. For $C^*$-algebras it reduces to the usual definition. We illustrate our invariant by means of the spectral localizer.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Leavitt path algebras: Zhang twist and irreducible representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15910v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct (graded) automorphisms fixing all vertices of Leavitt path algebras of arbitrary graphs in terms of general linear groups over corners of these algebras. As an application, we study Zhang twist of Leavitt path algebras and describe new classes of irreducible representations of Leavitt path algebras of the rose graphs $R_n$ with $n$ petals.</description>

      <title>Examples of compact quantum groups with $\operatorname{\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}}(\mathbb{G})$ a factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $\lambda\in\left]0,1\right]$ we exhibit an uncountable family of compact quantum groups $\mathbb{G}$ such that the von Neumann algebra $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ is the injective factor of type $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ with separable predual. We also show that uncountably many injective factors of type $\mathrm{III}_0$ arise as $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ for some compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$. To distinguish between our examples we introduce invariants related to the scaling group modeled on the Connes invariant $T$ for von Neumann algebras and investigate the connection between so obtained invariants of $\mathbb{G}$ and the Connes invariants $T(\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G}))$, $S(\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G}))$. In the final section we show that factors of type $\mathrm{I}$ cannot be obtained as $\mathsf{L}^{\!\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ for a non-trivial compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic decomposition in the space of unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical decomposition theory for states on a C*-algebra that are invariant under a group action has been studied by using the theory of orthogonal measures on the state space \cite{BR1}.
  In \cite{BK3}, we introduced the notion of \textit{generalized orthogonal measures} on the space of unital completely positive (UCP) maps from a C*-algebra $A$ into $B(H)$. In this article, we consider a group $G$ that acts on a C*-algebra $A$, and the collection of $G$-invariant UCP maps from $A$ into $B(H)$. This article examines a $G$-invariant decomposition of UCP maps by using the theory of generalized orthogonal measures on the space of UCP maps, developed in \cite{BK3}. Further, the set of all $G$-invariant UCP maps is a compact and convex subset of a topological vector space. Hence, by characterizing the extreme points of this set, we complete the picture of barycentric decomposition in the space of $G$-invariant UCP maps. We establish this theory in Stinespring and Paschke dilations of completely positive maps. We end this note by mentioning some examples of UCP maps admitting a decomposition into $G$-invariant UCP maps.</description>

      <title>On certain invariants of compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a number of invariants of locally compact quantum groups defined by their scaling and modular groups and the spectrum of their modular elements. Focusing mainly on compact quantum groups we consider the question whether triviality of one of the invariants is equivalent to the quantum group being of Kac type and show that it has a positive answer in many cases including duals of second countable type $\mathrm{I}$ discrete quantum groups. We perform a complete calculation of the invariants for all $q$-deformations of compact, simply connected, semisimple Lie groups as well as for some non-compact quantum groups and the compact quantum groups $\operatorname{U}_F^+$. Finally we introduce a family of conditions for discrete quantum groups which for classical discrete groups are all equivalent to the fact that the group is i.c.c. We show that the above mentioned question about characterization of Kac type quantum groups by one of our invariants has a positive answer for duals of discrete quantum groups satisfying such an i.c.c.-type condition and illustrate this with the example of $\operatorname{U}_F^+$.</description>
