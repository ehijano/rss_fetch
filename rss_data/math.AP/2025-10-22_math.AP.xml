      <title>On the Harnack inequality for time-fractional and more general non-local in time subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the Harnack inequality for globally positive local solutions to a general class of nonlocal in time subdiffusion equations in one space dimension, which includes time-fractional diffusion equations with time order less than one. It is already known that for these equations the classical Harnack inequality does not hold if the space dimension is greater than or equal to two. Here, we complete the analysis, by providing a positive result in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>Traveling Waves in the McKean-Vlasov Equation under Sakaguchi-Kuramoto Interaction with Phase Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the McKean-Vlasov equation for weakly coupled oscillators subject to the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto interaction. While the Kuramoto interaction provides a good approximation for small, densely connected networks, time delays in larger networks lead to symmetry-breaking phase offsets (frustrations). The Sakaguchi-Kuramoto interaction is the simplest such generalization, featuring a single frustration parameter. We establish the existence of a continuous global phase transition from incoherence to coherence, in the form of a propagating asymmetrically extended von Mises probability distribution function (AvMPDF). The corresponding traveling wave equation reduces to a system of two equations in two unknowns: the order parameter for the AvMPDF and the wave speed. The analysis relies on an appropriate asymmetrical extension of the modified Bessel function.</description>

      <title>Fokas method for linear convection-diffusion equation with time-dependent coefficients and its extension to other evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a linear convection-diffusion equation with time-dependent coefficients on a bounded interval. The problem includes inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and is motivated by physical models where the diffusivity and transport change with time, such as heat or mass transfer in non-stationary environments. We apply and adapt the Unified Transform Method (UTM), which handles both time-varying coefficients and nonzero boundary data, to obtain an explicit integral formula for the solution. %The method allows us to handle both time-varying coefficients and nonzero boundary data by removing unknown boundary traces emerging upon finite line Fourier transform (FLFT) through a spectral symmetry argument. Next, we study well-posedness of the model in fractional Sobolev spaces and prove spatial and temporal regularity estimates. We show that the smoothing effect of the heat operator is still prevalent even when coefficients depend on time under suitable sign and growth assumptions on the coefficients. Finally, we extend this approach to obtain the solution for several evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients, in one space variable.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the derivation of the virial identity for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of the virial identity for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. In \cite{O06, FM17}, several conservation laws, such as for the charge and the energy, were derived without constructing a sequence of approximate solutions. Their approach involves additional properties of solutions due to Strichartz' estimate. In this paper, we derive the virial identity without constructing the sequence of approximate solutions or employing a regularizing argument for weights, by exploiting the properties of solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Weighted Estimates for Schr\"odinger Pseudo-Multipliers and its Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the unweighted and weighted $L^p$-boundedness of pseudo-multipliers associated with a class of Schr\"odinger operators. The weight classes we consider are tailored to this framework and strictly contain the classical Muckenhoupt $A_p$-classes. To establish the weighted boundedness, we prove a quantitative version of reverse H\"older's inequality and quantitative weighted estimates for general sparse operators, which are of independent interest. We also study commutators of Schr\"odinger pseudo-multipliers, establishing their boundedness and compactness results on these weighted $L^p$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Linearized equation and generic regularity in the Alt-Caffarelli problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Alt-Caffarelli problem, we study free boundary regularity of energy minimizers. In six dimensions, we show that free boundaries are analytic for generic boundary data. In general, we improve previous generic Hausdorff dimensions of the singular sets.
  To achieve this, we analyze positive solutions to the linearized equation around homogeneous minimizers (possibly with singular sections on the sphere). For this equation, we prove a Harnack inequality and establish a dimensional lower bound for its principal eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: We study incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \ge 4$ under bi-rotational symmetry without swirl, which reduces the Euler equations to a scalar vorticity advection in the first quadrant.

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the symmetric flow via inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation estimates for the linearized Navier-Stokes system around the symmetric flow in a finite channel with the non-slip boundary condition. As an immediate consequence, we prove the asymptotic stability of the symmetric flow in the high Reynolds number regime. Namely, if the initial velocity perturbation $u^{\mathrm{in}}$ satisfies $\Vert u^{\mathrm{in}}-(U(y),0) \Vert_{H^5}\leq c \nu^{\frac{2}{3}}$, then inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation estimates also hold for the solution to the Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>The optimal transition threshold for the 2D Couette flow in the infinite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations in the infinite channel $\mathbb{R}\times [-1,1]$ with the Navier-slip boundary condition. We show that if the initial perturbations $\omega^{in}$ around the Couette flow satisfy $\|\omega^{in}\|_{H^3_{x,y}\cap L^1_x H^3_y}\leq c\nu^{\frac13}$, the solution admits enhanced dissipation at $x$-frequencies $|k|\gg \nu$ and inviscid damping effect. The key contributions lie in two parts: (1) we adopt the new decomposition of the vorticity $\omega=\omega_{L}+\omega_e$, where $\omega_L$ effectively captures a ``weak" enhanced dissipation $(1+\nu^{\frac13} t)^{-\frac14}e^{-\nu t}$ and the corresponding velocity exhibits the inviscid damping effect; (2) we introduce the dyadic decomposition for the long time scale $t\geq \nu^{-\frac16}$ and apply the ``infinite superposition principle" to the equation for $\omega_e$ in order to control the growth induced by echo cascades, which appears to be novel and may hold independent significance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability for the 2D Couette flow on the infinite channel with non-slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantitative stability for the 2D Couette flow on the infinite channel $\mathbb{R}\times [-1,1]$ with non-slip boundary condition. Compared to the case $\mathbb{T}\times [-1,1]$, we establish the stability in the context of long wave associated with the frequency range $0\leq |k|&lt;1$ by developing the resolvent estimate argument. The new ingredient is to discover the key division point at $10\nu$ in the frequency interval $(0,1)$ by the sharp Sobolev constant in Wirtinger's inequality together with the refined estimates of the Airy function in the interval $(0,1)$, and then we establish the space-time estimates on the low-frequency $0\leq |k|\leq 10 \nu$ and the intermediate-frequency $ 10 \nu\leq |k|&lt;1$, respectively. As an application of the space-time estimates, we obtain the nonlinear transition threshold to be $\gamma\leq\frac{1}{2}$.Meanwhile, we also show that when the frequencies $|k|\geq \nu^{1-}$, the enhanced dissipation effect occurs for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Blow-up results for a Nakao-type problem with a time-dependent damping term and derivative-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a semilinear system of damped wave equations coupled through power nonlinearities of derivative-type. In particular, we consider a classical damped wave equation, i.e., with constant coefficients, and a wave equation with a time-dependent coefficient for the damping term. For this time-dependent coefficient we analyze two cases: the scale-invariant case and the scattering producing case. We prove blow-up results and derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan of local solutions. Our approach is based on an iteration argument for a couple of functionals related to the components of a local solution.</description>

      <title>Crystalline motion of discrete interfaces in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete-to-continuum evolution of a lattice system consisting of two immiscible phases labelled by -1 and +1 in presence of a surfactant phase labelled by 0. The system's energy is described by the classical Blume-Emery-Griffith model on the lattice epsilon Z^2, and its continuum evolution is obtained as epsilon tends to zero through a minimizing-movements scheme with a time step proportional to epsilon. The dissipation functional we choose contains two contributions: a standard Almgren-Taylor-Wang type term penalizing the distance between successive configurations of the +1 phase, and a term penalizing the variation of the surfactant mass and modeling surfactant evaporation. The latter term depends on a scaling parameter gamma &gt; 0, which determines whether the surfactant mass is conserved at each time step. We focus on the case in which the initial configuration consists of a single crystal of phase 1 completely wetted by the surfactant. For gamma &gt; 2 the surfactant can lose mass and the evolution reduces to the crystalline mean curvature flow of an Ising-type model, while for gamma &lt; 2 the conservation of the surfactant mass leads to a more complex evolution characterized by stronger non-uniqueness and partial pinning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study Momentum Light Ray Transform (MLRT) on symmetric tensor fields. MLRT is an integral transform in time-space domain ($(t,x)\in \mathbb{R}^{1+n}$), which integrates a scalar function or a tensor field along the light rays with a polynomial type weight. We explore necessary and sufficient conditions for injectivity of MLRT, over general order tensors on space dimension $\geq 2$, from full and restricted measurements. Furthermore, we develop an inversion algorithm for MLRTs in the restricted measurement setting. To prove the results, we use tools from tensor tomography, geometry, and analysis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement principle and fractional Calder\'on problem for nonlocal parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine inverse problems for the variable-coefficient nonlocal parabolic operator $(\partial_t - \Delta_g)^s$, where $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$. This article makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a novel entanglement principle for these operators under suitable smoothness conditions. Second, we prove that lower-order perturbations can be uniquely determined from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map using this principle. However, due to insufficient solution regularity, direct application of the entanglement principle to the inverse problem is not feasible. To address this, we derive a modified entanglement principle, enabling the effective resolution of related inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the Sphere Covering Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sphere Covering Inequality was introduced in \cite{GM} (\emph{Invent. Math.}, 2018) as a sharp geometric inequality that provides a lower bound for the total area of two distinct surfaces of Gaussian curvature 1. These surfaces are assumed to be conformal to the Euclidean unit disk and share the same conformal factor along the boundary. In this paper, we establish a quantitative generalization that relaxes the boundary matching condition by allowing the conformal factors to differ by a constant \( c \ge 0 \) on the boundary. This refinement reveals a new stability-type structure underlying the inequality. Our results show that the Sphere Covering Inequality is stable with respect to perturbations in the boundary data and provide a precise quantitative description of how the total-area bound varies under such perturbations. The generalized inequality provides new analytic and geometric tools for the study of elliptic equations with exponential nonlinearities, conformal geometry, and related problems in mathematical physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_1}A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1 \cdot \nabla u_1 = \lambda_1 u_1 + g_{\beta,1}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[3mm] -\mathrm{div}(A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_2}A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2 \cdot \nabla u_2 = \lambda_2 u_2 + g_{\beta,2}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[2mm] u_1 = u_2 = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 &lt; \mu_1$, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian, and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain. The nonlinearity derives from a potential $G_\beta$ with subcritical growth.
  Due to the lack of differentiability of the associated energy functional, we employ nonsmooth critical point theory and variational methods based on the concept of weak slope. We prove the existence of least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta &gt; 0$) and competitive ($\beta &lt; 0$) regimes.</description>

      <title>A revisit of patch solutions for the 2D Loglog-Euler type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the patch solutions for a class of inviscid whole-space active scalar equations that interpolate between the 2D Euler equation and the $\alpha$-SQG equation. Compared with the 2D Euler equation in vorticity form, there is an additional Fourier multiplier $m(\Lambda)$ ($\Lambda = (-\Delta)^{1/2}$) in the Biot-Savart law. If the symbol $m$ satisfies the Osgood-type condition $$\int_2^{+\infty} \frac{1}{r (\log r) m(r)} dr= +\infty$$ and certain mild assumptions, the system is referred to as the 2D Loglog-Euler type equation.
  First, we prove a Yudovich-type theorem establishing the existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution for the Loglog-Euler type equation associated with bounded and integrable initial data. This result directly applies to patch solutions, which are weak solutions corresponding to patch initial data given by characteristic functions of disjoint, regular, bounded domains.
  Next, we revisit the seminal result by Elgindi ( Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 211(3) 965-990, 2014 ) and provide a different proof under explicit assumptions on $m$, showing that for the 2D Loglog-Euler type equation with $C^{1,\mu}$ ($0&lt;\mu&lt;1$) single-patch initial data, the evolved patch boundary globally preserves the $C^{1,\mu-\varepsilon}$ regularity for any $\varepsilon \in (0,\mu)$. In contrast to the frequency-space argument in Elgindi's result, we develop an entirely physical-space-based approach that avoids the Littlewood-Paley theory and offers advantages for potential extensions to the half-plane or bounded smooth domains.
  Furthermore, we investigate the global propagation of higher-order $C^{n,\mu}$ boundary regularity for patch solutions with any $n \in \mathbb{N}^\star$, and analyze the evolution of multiple patches.</description>

      <title>The minimal wave speed of time-periodic traveling waves arising from a diffusive Kermack-McKendrick model with seasonality and nonlocal delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the non-existence of time-periodic traveling wave solution with speed less than the critical speed for diffusive Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model incorporating seasonality and nonlocal interactions induced by latent period. By a technical construction of upper and lower solutions on truncated intervals for an auxiliary linear equation, we overcome the challenges arising from the coupling of nonlocal delay and the fact that the system is non-autonomous. Thus the critical value $c^*$ defined in [S.-M. Wang et al., Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl., 55 (2020) 103117] is confirmed as the minimal wave speed of time-periodic traveling waves. We have completely solved the open problem [S.-M. Wang et al., Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl., 55 (2020) 103117]</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability in Discrete Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates several aspects related to quantitative stability in optimal transport, as well as uniqueness of the dual transport problem. Our main contributions are as follows. Chapter 1: Observations regarding the quantitative stability of optimal transport plans with respect to Wasserstein distance on the product space. Chapter 2: Extention of strong convexity inequalities for the Kantorovich functional to a larger class of source measures, using glueing arguments recently used for the quantitative stability of optimal transport maps. Chapters 3/4: A qualitative description of the behaviour of the fully discrete transport problem under perturbation of the support positions, as well as quantitative stability under uniqueness assumptions. Chapter 5: Extention of known uniqueness criteria for the dual transport problem. We show that when one marginal measure has Lipschitz-path connected support and the other has bounded support, the values of dual optimisers are unique up to a constant for a large family of costs, including $p$-costs for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>

      <title>SPIKE: Stable Physics-Informed Kernel Evolution Method for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stable Physics-Informed Kernel Evolution (SPIKE) method for numerical computation of inviscid hyperbolic conservation laws. SPIKE resolves a fundamental paradox: how strong-form residual minimization can capture weak solutions containing discontinuities. SPIKE employs reproducing kernel representations with regularized parameter evolution, where Tikhonov regularization provides a smooth transition mechanism through shock formation, allowing the dynamics to traverse shock singularities. This approach automatically maintains conservation, tracks characteristics, and captures shocks satisfying Rankine-Hugoniot conditions within a unified framework requiring no explicit shock detection or artificial viscosity. Numerical validation across scalar and vector-valued conservation laws confirms the method's effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, under an abstract setting we establish the spreading properties and the existence, non-existence and global attractivity of spatially heterogeneous steady states for a large class of monotone evolution systems without the translational monotonicity under the assumption that one limiting system has both leftward and rightward spreading speeds and the other one has the uniform asymptotic annihilation. Then we apply the developed theory to study the global dynamics of asymptotically homogeneous integro-difference equations, and provide a counter-example to show that the value of the nonlinear function at the finite range of location may give rise to nontrivial fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give a trajectorial proof of a kinetic Poincar\'e inequality which plays an important role in the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for kinetic equations. The present work improves a result due to J. Guerand and C. Mouhot [10] in several directions. We use kinetic trajectories along the vector fields $\partial_t + v \cdot \nabla_x$ and $\partial_{v_i}$, $i = 1,\dots, d$ and do not rely on higher-order commutators such as $[\partial_{v_i},\partial_t + v \cdot \nabla_x] = \partial_{x_i}$ or on the fundamental solution. The presented method also applies to more general hypoelliptic equations. We illustrate this by studying a Kolmogorov equation with $k$ steps.</description>

      <title>The interaction between rough vortex patch and boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the half-plane under high Reynolds number conditions, where the initial vorticity belongs to the Yudovich class and is supported away from the boundary. We establish the $L^p$ ($2\leq p&lt; \infty$) convergence of solutions from the Navier-Stokes equations to those of the Euler equations. One of the main difficulties stems from the limited regularity of the initial data, which hinders the derivation of an asymptotic expansion. To overcome this challenge, we first prove a Kato-type criterion adapted to the Yudovich class setting. We then obtain uniform estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations -- a non-trivial task due to the strong boundary layer effects. A key component of our approach is the introduction of a suitable functional framework, which enables us to control the interaction between the rough vortex patch and the boundary layer.</description>

Abstract: We provide few remarks on nonlinear Landau damping that concerns decay of the electric field in the classical Vlasov-Poisson system near spatially homogenous equilibria. In particular, this includes the analyticity framework, \`a la Grenier-Nguyen-Rodnianski, for non specialists, treating the analytic case studied by Mouhot-Villani, among other remarks for plasmas confined on a torus and in the whole space. Finally, we also establish the nonlinear Landau damping for a family of Vlasov-Riesz systems, which are new and surprisingly include the borderline Vlasov-Dirac-Benney system in the sharp analytic spaces.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations on looping-edge graphs with $\delta'$-type interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the existence and orbital (in)stability of certain standing-wave solutions for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on a looping-edge graph $\mathcal{G}$, consisting of a circle and a finite number $N$ of infinite half-lines attached to a common vertex. Our main goal is to take the first steps toward understanding the dynamics of the NLS under $\delta'$-type interactions. Here we consider a negative $Z$-strength at the vertex, where continuity of the wave function is not mandatory. On the circle, we propose Jacobi elliptic profiles of dnoidal type combined with soliton tail profiles on the half-lines, and we establish the existence and (in)stability of these solutions depending on the relative size of $N$, $Z$, and the phase velocity of the standing wave. Tools from Krein--von Neumann extension theory for symmetric operators play a fundamental role in our stability analysis. We also develop a local and global well-posedness theory for the NLS in the energy space $H^1(\mathcal{G})$. Finally, we present an approach to characterize the domains of self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator on a looping-edge graph, which incorporate the continuity of derivatives at the vertex.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates. A detailed comparison of the It\^o and Stratonovich interpretations for the proposed model is presented in the Appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate saddle point configurations in spherical ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy. These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet eigenvalue problems for some concave elliptic Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of solitary waves for the 1D focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the full asymptotic stability of solitary wave solutions for the 1D focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation on the line under small perturbations in weighted Sobolev spaces, building upon our results in [58]. The proof integrates the space-time resonances approach, based on the distorted Fourier transform, with modulation techniques to show modified scattering for the radiation term and convergence for the modulation parameters. A key challenge throughout the nonlinear analysis is the slow local decay of the radiation term, caused by threshold resonances in the linearized operator. The presence of favorable null structures in the quadratic nonlinearities mitigates this problem through the use of normal form transformations. Another essential step in the proof involves developing a variant of the local smoothing estimate that incorporates a moving center.</description>

      <title>Spherical harmonics and point configurations on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing spherical harmonics on the two-dimensional unit sphere as superpositions of Gaussian beams whose poles form well-separated point configurations. The distributional and analytic properties of the resulting spherical harmonics are determined by the geometry of these poles: when the configuration is equidistributed, the sequence of harmonics exhibits quantum ergodicity, while their $L^\infty$ norms are quantitatively controlled by the maximal clustering of poles within small neighborhoods of great circles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic geometry at infinity of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a vanishing theorem in $L^2$-cohomology for exact wedge $3$-Sasakian metrics generalizing a result of Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>

      <title>Removable sets for pseudoconvexity for weakly smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.</description>
