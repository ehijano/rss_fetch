      <title>Majorization and Inequalities among Complete Homogenous Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression with Multimodal Large Language Models and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques, our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then simplified by further processing with a language model.</description>

      <title>Deciding One to One property of Boolean maps: Condition and algorithm in terms of implicants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computational problem of deciding invertibility (or one to one-ness) of a Boolean map $F$ in $n$-Boolean variables. This problem is a special case of deciding invertibilty of a map $F:\mathbb{F}_{q}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_{q}^n$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q=2$. Algebraic condition for invertibility of $F$ is well known to be equivalent to invertibility of the Koopman operator of $F$ as shown in \cite{RamSule}. In this paper a condition for invertibility is derived in the special case of Boolean maps $F:B_0^n\rightarrow B_0^n$ where $B_0$ is the two element Boolean algebra in terms of \emph{implicants} of Boolean equations defined by the map. This condition is then extended to the case of general maps in $n$ variables and $m\geq n$ equations. Hence this condition answers the special case of invertibility of maps $F$ defined over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$ alternatively, in terms of implicants instead of the Koopman operator. The problem of deciding invertibility of a map $F$ (or that of finding its Garden of Eden (GOE)) over finite fields is distinct from the satisfiability problem (SAT) or the problem of deciding consistency of polynomial equations over finite fields. Hence the well known algorithms for deciding SAT or of solvability using Grobner basis for checking membership in an ideal generated by polynomials is not known to answer the question of invertibility of a map. Similarly it appears that algorithms for satisfiability or polynomial solvability are not useful for computation of GOE of $F$ even for maps over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Inequalities among Symmetric Polynomial Functions: Counter-examples and New Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric polynomial functions are fundamental questions in mathematics and have various applications in science and engineering. This paper investigates a beautiful and inspiring conjecture, proposed by Cuttler, Greene and Skandera in 2011, on inequalities among the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial function $H_{n,\lambda}$: It states that the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$ implies majorization order $\lambda\preceq\mu$. The conjecture is a close analogy with other known results on Muirhead-type inequalities. In 2021, Heaton and Shankar disproved the conjecture by showing a counterexample for number of variables $n=3$ and degree $d=8$. They then asked whether the conjecture is true when $n$ is sufficiently large. In this paper, we show, by a family of counter-examples, that the conjecture does not hold for any $n$ and any $d$ as long as $n\geq2$ and $d\geq8$. Based on the insights gained from the counter-examples, we propose a new conjecture for the inequality $H_{n,\lambda}\leq H_{n,\mu}$.</description>
