      <title>Modular versus Hierarchical: A Structural Signature of Topic Popularity in Mathematical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical researchers, especially those in early-career positions, face critical decisions about topic specialization with limited information about the collaborative environments of different research areas. The aim of this paper is to study how the popularity of a research topic is associated with the structure of that topic's collaboration network, as observed by a suite of measures capturing organizational structure at several scales. We apply these measures to 1,938 algorithmically discovered topics across 121,391 papers sourced from arXiv metadata during the period 2020--2025. Our analysis, which controls for the confounding effects of network size, reveals a structural dichotomy--we find that popular topics organize into modular "schools of thought," while niche topics maintain hierarchical core-periphery structures centered around established experts. This divide is not an artifact of scale, but represents a size-independent structural pattern correlated with popularity. We also document a "constraint reversal": after controlling for size, researchers in popular fields face greater structural constraints on collaboration opportunities, contrary to conventional expectations. Our findings suggest that topic selection is an implicit choice between two fundamentally different collaborative environments, each with distinct implications for a researcher's career. To make these structural patterns transparent to the research community, we developed the Math Research Compass (https://mathresearchcompass.com), an interactive platform providing data on topic popularity and collaboration patterns across mathematical topics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving Large Language Models for Competitive Program Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Due to the demand for strong algorithmic reasoning, complex logic implementation, and strict adherence to input/output formats and resource constraints, competitive programming generation by large language models (LLMs) is considered the most challenging problem in current LLM-based code generation. However, previous studies often evaluate LLMs using simple prompts and benchmark datasets prone to data leakage. Moreover, prior work has limited consideration of the diversity in algorithm types and difficulty levels. Objective: In this study, we aim to evaluate and improve LLMs in solving real-world competitive programming problems. Methods: We initially collect 117 problems from nine regional ICPC/CCPC contests held in 2024 and design four filtering criteria to construct a curated benchmark consisting of 80 problems. Leveraging DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM, we evaluate its competitive program generation capabilities through the online judge (OJ) platforms, guided by a carefully designed basic prompt. For incorrect submissions, we construct a fine-grained error taxonomy and then propose a targeted improvement framework by combining a multi-turn dialogue-based repair phase and an information-augmented regeneration phase. Results: Experimental results show that only 5 out of 80 problems are fully accepted when using basic prompts. For the unsolved problems, we construct the error taxonomy, including general errors (such as design, boundary, condition, data type, syntax, and input/output errors) and specialized errors (such as those in mathematical problems, greedy algorithms, and graph theories). After applying our proposed improvement strategies, we substantially increased the number of correct solutions, with 46 out of 80 problems successfully accepted.</description>

      <title>Prediction Gaps as Pathways to Explanation: Rethinking Educational Outcomes through Differences in Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social contexts -- such as families, schools, and neighborhoods -- shape life outcomes. The key question is not simply whether they matter, but rather for whom and under what conditions. Here, we argue that prediction gaps -- differences in predictive performance between statistical models of varying complexity -- offer a pathway for identifying surprising empirical patterns (i.e., not captured by simpler models) which highlight where theories succeed or fall short. Using population-scale administrative data from the Netherlands, we compare logistic regression, gradient boosting, and graph neural networks to predict university completion using early-life social contexts. Overall, prediction gaps are small, suggesting that previously identified indicators, particularly parental status, capture most measurable variation in educational attainment. However, gaps are larger for girls growing up without fathers -- suggesting that the effects of social context for these groups go beyond simple models in line with sociological theory. Our paper shows the potential of prediction methods to support sociological explanation.</description>

      <title>Community-Based Efficient Algorithms for User-Driven Competitive Influence Maximization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, people in the modern world communicate with their friends, relatives, and colleagues through the internet. Persons/nodes and communication/edges among them form a network. Social media networks are a type of network where people share their views with the community. There are several models that capture human behavior, such as a reaction to the information received from friends or relatives. The two fundamental models of information diffusion widely discussed in the social networks are the Independent Cascade Model and the Linear Threshold Model. Liu et al. [1] propose a variant of the linear threshold model in their paper title User-driven competitive influence Maximization(UDCIM) in social networks. Authors try to simulate human behavior where they do not make a decision immediately after being influenced, but take a pause for a while, and then they make a final decision. They propose the heuristic algorithms and prove the approximation factor under community constraints( The seed vertices belong to an identical community). Even finding the community is itself an NP-hard problem. In this article, we extend the existing work with algorithms and LP-formation of the problem. We also implement and test the LP-formulated equations on small datasets by using the Gurobi Solver [2]. We furthermore propose one heuristic and one genetic algorithm. The extensive experimentation is carried out on medium to large datasets, and the outcomes of both algorithms are plotted in the results and discussion section.</description>

      <title>Peer Review as Structured Commentary: Immutable Identity, Public Dialogue, and Reproducible Scholarship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reconceptualises peer review as structured public commentary. Traditional academic validation is hindered by anonymity, latency, and gatekeeping. We propose a transparent, identity-linked, and reproducible system of scholarly evaluation anchored in open commentary. Leveraging blockchain for immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, we design a framework that incentivises intellectual contribution, captures epistemic evolution, and enables traceable reputational dynamics. This model empowers fields from computational science to the humanities, reframing academic knowledge as a living process rather than a static credential.</description>

      <title>Context, Credibility, and Control: User Reflections on AI Assisted Misinformation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how collaborative AI systems can enhance user agency in identifying and evaluating misinformation on social media platforms. Traditional methods, such as personal judgment or basic fact-checking, often fall short when faced with emotionally charged or context-deficient content. To address this, we designed and evaluated an interactive interface that integrates collaborative AI features, including real-time explanations, source aggregation, and debate-style interaction. These elements aim to support critical thinking by providing contextual cues and argumentative reasoning in a transparent, user-centered format. In a user study with 14 participants, 79% found the debate mode more effective than standard chatbot interfaces, and the multiple-source view received an average usefulness rating of 4.6 out of 5. Our findings highlight the potential of context-rich, dialogic AI systems to improve media literacy and foster trust in digital information environments. We argue that future tools for misinformation mitigation should prioritize ethical design, explainability, and interactive engagement to empower users in a post-truth era.</description>

      <title>Density, asymmetry and citation dynamics in scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors. We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach, surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models. These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact. Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the dynamics of scientific reward.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Attribute and Structural Anomalies for Improved Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses. Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Breadth, Depth, and Flux of Course-Prerequisite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Course-prerequisite networks (CPNs) are directed acyclic graphs that model complex academic curricula by representing courses as nodes and dependencies between them as directed links. These networks are indispensable tools for visualizing, studying, and understanding curricula. For example, CPNs can be used to detect important courses, improve advising, guide curriculum design, analyze graduation time distributions, and quantify the strength of knowledge flow between different university departments. However, most CPN analyses to date have focused only on micro- and meso-scale properties. To fill this gap, we define and study three new global CPN measures: breadth, depth, and flux. All three measures are invariant under transitive reduction and are based on the concept of topological stratification, which generalizes topological ordering in directed acyclic graphs. These measures can be used for macro-scale comparison of different CPNs. We illustrate the new measures numerically by applying them to three real and synthetic CPNs from three universities: the Cyprus University of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and Johns Hopkins University. The CPN data analyzed in this paper are publicly available in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents Are the Antidote to Walled Gardens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.</description>

      <title>Scaling Human Judgment in Community Notes with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an open ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of which notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This approach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and legitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of diverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter of what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be used to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful notes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This becomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver context quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn, enhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can work, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research agenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Who is driving the conversation? Analysing the nodality of British MPs and journalists on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, political conversations now take place in more diffuse environments. In this context, it is not always clear why some actors, more than others, have greater influence on how discussions are shaped. To investigate the factors behind such influence, we build on nodality, a concept in political science which describes the capacity of an actor to exchange information within discourse networks. This concept goes beyond traditional network metrics that describe the position of an actor in the network to include exogenous drivers of influence (e.g. factors relating to organisational hierarchies). We study online discourse on Twitter (now X) in the UK to measure the relative nodality of two sets of policy actors - Members of Parliament (MPs) and accredited journalists - on four policy topics. We find that influence on the platform is driven by two key factors: (i) active nodality, derived from the actor's level of topic-related engagement, and (ii) inherent nodality, which is independent of the platform discourse and reflects the actor's institutional position. These findings significantly further our understanding of the origins of influence on social media platforms and suggest in which contexts influence is transferable across topics.</description>

      <title>Voter model can accurately predict individual opinions in online populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate general opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the user level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the user level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popularity dynamics in social media depend on a complex interplay of social influence between users and popularity-based recommendations that are provided by the platforms. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time dynamical system to model the evolution of popularity on social media. Our model generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model to a set of influencers vying for popularity. We study the asymptotic behavior of this model and illustrate it with numerical examples. Our results highlight the interplay of social influence, past popularity, and content quality in determining the popularity of influencers.</description>

Abstract: Deepfakes can fuel online misinformation. As deepfakes get harder to recognize with the naked eye, human users become more reliant on deepfake detection models to help them decide whether a video is real or fake. Currently, models yield a prediction for a video's authenticity, but do not integrate a method for alerting a human user. We introduce a framework for amplifying artifacts in deepfake videos to make them more detectable by people. We propose a novel, semi-supervised Artifact Attention module, which is trained on human responses to create attention maps that highlight video artifacts, and magnify them to create a novel visual indicator we call "Deepfake Caricatures". In a user study, we demonstrate that Caricatures greatly increase human detection, across video presentation times and user engagement levels. We also introduce a deepfake detection model that incorporates the Artifact Attention module to increase its accuracy and robustness. Overall, we demonstrate the success of a human-centered approach to designing deepfake mitigation methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization and Low-Rank Attention for Noisy Node Classification</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in learning node representations and have shown strong performance in tasks such as node classification. However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations. The code is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/GCL-LR-Attention.</description>

      <title>Z-REx: Human-Interpretable GNN Explanations for Real Estate Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18001</link>

Abstract: Transparency and interpretability are crucial for enhancing customer confidence and user engagement, especially when dealing with black-box Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendation systems. Modern recommendation systems leverage Graph Neural Network (GNN) due to their ability to produce high-quality recommendations in terms of both relevance and diversity. Therefore, the explainability of GNN is especially important for Link Prediction (LP) tasks since recommending relevant items can be viewed as predicting links between users and items. GNN explainability has been a well-studied field, but existing methods primarily focus on node or graph-level tasks, leaving a gap in LP explanation techniques. This work introduces Z-REx, a GNN explanation framework designed explicitly for heterogeneous link prediction tasks. Z-REx utilizes structural and attribute perturbation to identify critical substructures and important features while reducing the search space by leveraging domain-specific knowledge. In our experimentation, we show the efficacy of Z-REx in generating contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations for ZiGNN, a GNN-based recommendation engine, using a real-world real-estate dataset from Zillow Group, Inc. We compare against State-of-The-Art (SOTA) GNN explainers to show Z-REx outperforms them by 61% in the Fidelity metric by producing superior human-interpretable explanations.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>
