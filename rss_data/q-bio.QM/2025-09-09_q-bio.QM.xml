      <title>ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs for downstream generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of Bayesian and Frequentist methods for epidemic forecasting: Insights from simulated and historical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is critical for effective public health interventions. This study compares Bayesian and Frequentist estimation frameworks within deterministic compartmental epidemic models, focusing on nonlinear least squares optimization versus Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling via Stan. We compare forecasting performance under shared modeling structure and error assumptions for specific implementations of both approaches.
  We assess performance on simulated datasets (with R0 values of 2 and 1.5) and historical datasets including the 1918 influenza pandemic, 1896-97 Bombay plague, and COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Weighted Interval Score, and 95% prediction interval coverage.
  Forecasting performance depends on epidemic phase and dataset characteristics, with no method consistently outperforming across all contexts. Frequentist methods perform well at peak and post-peak phases but are less accurate pre-peak. Bayesian methods, particularly with uniform priors, offer better early-epidemic accuracy and stronger uncertainty quantification, especially valuable when data are sparse or noisy. Frequentist methods often yield more accurate point forecasts with lower error metrics, though their interval estimates may be less robust.
  We examine how prior choice influences Bayesian forecasts and how extending forecasting horizons affects convergence. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing estimation strategies tailored to epidemic phase and data quality, supporting more effective public health interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present bfact, a Python package for performing accurate low-rank Boolean matrix factorisation (BMF). bfact uses a hybrid combinatorial optimisation approach based on a priori candidate factors generated from clustering algorithms. It selects the best disjoint factors before performing either a second combinatorial or heuristic algorithm to recover the BMF. We show that bfact does particularly well at estimating the true rank of matrices in simulated settings. In real benchmarks, using a collation of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from the Human Lung Cell Atlas, we show that bfact achieves strong signal recovery, with a much lower rank.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of dynamical models in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems theory describes how interacting quantities change over time and space, from molecular oscillators to large-scale biological patterns. Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families: regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states. Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of chemical and biological systems. By highlighting strengths, limitations, and interpretability, we aim to guide researchers in selecting tools for analyzing complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamics in the life sciences.</description>

      <title>STL-based Optimization of Biomolecular Neural Networks for Regression and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>Computational predictions of nutrient precipitation for intensified cell 1 culture media via amino acid solution thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex mixtures.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable organ level 3D plant segmentation: Bridging the data algorithm computing gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

      <title>An AI system to help scientists write expert-level empirical software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow, manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value itself is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.</description>

      <title>Nanobot Algorithms for Treatment of Diffuse Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns. For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics studies are becoming increasingly large and commonplace, necessitating simultaneous analysis of a large number of spatially resolved variables. Correspondingly, a diverse range of methodologies have been proposed to compare the spatial expression structure of genes. Here, we apply persistent homology, a method from topological data analysis, to produce a continuous quantification of spatial structure in a given gene's expression, and show how this can be used for downstream tasks such as spatially variable gene identification. We explore the unique advantages of topology for this task, deriving biologically meaningful insights into kidney disease and myocardial infarction using public spatial transcriptomics data. We also show how the non-parametric nature of homology enables our methodology to extend naturally to other spatial omics modalities, demonstrating this on a spatial metabolomics sample. Our work showcases the advantages of using a continuous quantification of spatial structure over p-value based approaches to SVG identification, the potential for developing unified methods for the analysis of different spatial omics modalities, and the utility of persistent homology in big data applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding interesting phenomena is the core of scientific discovery, but it is a manual, ill-defined concept. We present an integrative pipeline for automating the discovery of interesting simple hypotheses (feature-target relations with effect direction and a potential underlying mechanism) in structured biomedical data. The pipeline combines machine learning, knowledge graphs, literature search and Large Language Models. We formalize "interestingness" as a combination of novelty, utility and plausibility. On 8 major diseases from the UK Biobank, our pipeline consistently recovers risk factors years before their appearance in the literature. 40--53% of our top candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts. The pipeline addresses the challenge of operationalizing "interestingness" scalably and for any target.

      <title>Unsupervised Evolutionary Cell Type Matching via Entropy-Minimized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan, transforming diffuse transport matrices into sparse, interpretable correspondences. Through systematic evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that OT-MESH achieves near-optimal matching accuracy with computational efficiency, while maintaining remarkable robustness to noise. Compared to other OT-based methods like RefCM, OT-MESH provides speedup while achieving comparable accuracy. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. The U-Net is compared with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>PLAME: Lightweight MSA Design Advances Protein Folding From Evolutionary Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation-diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.</description>
