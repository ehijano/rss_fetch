      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni$\~n$o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>

      <title>Extending SST Anomaly Forecasts Through Simultaneous Decomposition of Seasonal and PDO Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to forecasting North Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) by recognizing that interannual variability primarily reflects amplitude changes in four dominant seasonal cycles. Our multivariate linear model simultaneously captures these amplitude-modulated seasonal cycles along with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which naturally emerges as an intrinsic feature of the system rather than a separate phenomenon. Using sixteen-dimensional regression based on four spatially distributed time series per variable, the model delivers unprecedented forecast accuracy for both interannual amplitude modulations and PDO evolution, maintaining skill beyond 36 months -- a substantial improvement over current operational and research forecasts, including machine learning methods. Predictions initialized in 2024 project that the PDO will remain in its negative phase through late 2026, implying reduced likelihood of severe marine heatwaves in the eastern North Pacific during this period. These findings have direct implications for regional climate impacts, including storm tracks, precipitation patterns, and marine ecosystem health. By treating seasonal and interannual variability as coupled rather than independent processes, this framework advances our understanding of North Pacific climate dynamics and provides a powerful tool for stakeholders managing climate-sensitive resources and planning adaptation strategies in regions strongly influenced by North Pacific conditions.</description>

      <title>Tracking Summer Greenland Blocking: the Upstream Pathway Shapes Historical Extremes and Future Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation and future evolution of summer Greenland atmospheric blocking is here investigated from a Lagrangian perspective using a novel python package \textit{blocktrack}. By applying the blocktrack algorithm to ERA5 reanalysis and a CMIP6 model ensemble, we identify and track blocking events over Greenland, and obtain their trajectories, intensities, durations and wave-breaking characteristics. Two types of Greenland Blocking (GB) are identified in ERA5 via the Wave Breaking Index, respectively characterized by anticyclonic and cyclonic wave breaking. These correspond to the previously identified upstream and retrograding GBs. Upstream blocks, which originate in Northern Canada, exhibit stronger moisture transport before and during the blocking onset and higher temperature anomalies than retrograding blocks, which follow a east-to-west trajectory and originate in the Northern Atlantic. Our analyses show how the recent observed increase in the frequency of GB, particularly in 2012, is primarily driven by upstream blocks. CMIP6 models generally fail to capture the increase seen in observations and underestimate GB variability. Future projections under the SSP370 scenario show a decline in retrograding blocks but a possible increase in upstream blocks, depending on the detection index used. We discuss possible drivers of these changes, which include jet stream position shifts, increased frequency of high moisture transport events from the equator to the high latitudes, surface temperature increases due to Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and Arctic Amplification. By analyzing block trajectories, this study demonstrates how Lagrangian diagnostics can provide novel insights into the dynamics of blocking events over Greenland.</description>

      <title>Flo: A data-driven limited-area storm surge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Flo, a data-driven storm surge model, covering the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. The model is built using the Anemoi framework for creating machine learning weather forecasting systems, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and partners. The model is based on a graph neural network, and is capable of simulating water level due to storm surge at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 hour with a quality comparable to the numerical model on which it was trained. The model was trained using a data set consisting of 43 years of atmospheric data from the 3-km Norwegian Reanalysis hindcast for mean sea level pressure and winds, and the NORA-Surge hindcast for storm surge. Evaluation was done by comparing results from hindcast runs of the Flo model against independent observations of more than 90 water level gauges along the European coast, and against the NORA-Surge hindcast. The evaluation shows that Flo produces hindcasts with accuracy similar to the NORA-Surge hindcast. Since no data assimilation was applied in the NORA-Surge hindcast used as training data, the Flo model is not expected to outperform the numerical model when compared to observations. The current work takes an important step transforming storm surge forecasting from being based purely on numerical physics-based models, to taking advantage of recent advancements in machine learning. This does not represent a large step forward with regards to improving the forecast skill, but forms a foundation for future training of a storm surge model that offers more flexibility for taking observations into account.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Rainfall-induced Mass Movement as Self-organization Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organizing processes shape Earth's surface, creating complex patterns from simple rules in most landforms. Rainfall-induced mass movements dramatically reshape landscapes through rapid sediment transfer, but whether they self-organize remains unknown. Here we decode their organizational principles by treating spatial changes in scar geometries as fingerprints of the movement process. In 65,936 scars worldwide, we discovered three geometric signals from width, sinuosity and curvature converge on shared patterns and identify a slow-to-fast hierarchy characteristic of self-organizing landforms: long-range correlations show width retaining spatial memory while curvature decorrelates quickly; power spectra quantify a 4-3-2 hierarchy (width-sinuosity-curvature) in scaling exponents; and information flow confirms a top-down organization (width-sinuosity-curvature). Although entropy increases toward finer scales, phase-space reconstructions settle on low-dimensional attractors, revealing hidden order. Together, the evidence shows that width establishes flow corridors through slow dynamics, sinuosity mediates momentum and gravity by intermediate adjustments, and curvature responds rapidly to the terrain. We also developed a model based on simple terrain-inertia trade-offs, demonstrating how mass movements maintain large-scale coherence while flexibly navigating obstacles, potentially extending run-out distances. This organizing rule offers a fundamental mechanism for predicting the destructive reach of mass movements, which are intensifying in our warming, wetter world.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence of inertia--gravity waves: a theory for the oceanic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a derivation using kinetic wave theory of the two-dimensional empirical Garrett--Munk spectrum for ocean internal waves, valid at all frequencies including near-inertial frequencies. This is based directly on the governing equations for a two-dimensional Boussinesq system with constant stratification and rotation. Our results improve on previous work by side-stepping the use of canonical variables, by taking full account of the Coriolis parameter in a non-hydrostatic dispersion relation, by filtering the balanced flow component from the dynamics, by using the conservation laws for energy and two components of pseudomomentum to bring the collision integral into a very simple form, by giving precise convergence conditions for the collision integral, and by finding the unique scale-invariant turbulent wave spectrum that corresponds to turbulent fluxes from small to large wavenumbers. The last step was achieved in the limit of small but nonzero Coriolis parameter.
  Key results are that any nonzero Coriolis parameter regularizes the singular nature of the non-rotating problem and that the homogeneity properties of the dispersion relation and of the interaction coefficients alone already imply that the spectrum is separable in vertical wavenumber and frequency. Within the restrictions of two-dimensional dynamics, this provides a theoretical framework for internal-wave turbulence consistent with oceanic observations.</description>

      <title>Climatic Extremes in Brazil: a parallel analysis of Historical Trends and Socioeconomical Impacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important consequence of human induced climate change is the increase in extreme weather events. This study contributes to the understanding of Brazil's climate change by examining historical temperature and precipitation patterns. Extreme events of temperature and precipitation are identified using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes records from 634 meteorological stations operating intermittently since 1961. Using the first 30 years (1961 to 1990) as the reference period, our results show a significant increase in warm days and a corresponding decrease in cold days over the last 30 years (1991 to 2020), in agreement with previous works. In terms of precipitation, it indicates a trend toward drier conditions in the Northeast region of Brazil, whereas the South is experiencing wetter conditions, with an increase in the number of heavy precipitation days in South and in the extremely dry periods in the Northeast. These results have been verified for consistency with several extreme climate indices measured in this study. Additionally, data from S2iD is analyzed, an official database that records natural disasters in Brazil, to estimate their impact in terms of human losses and financial costs over the past decade. Our findings indicate that drought events are the most economically costly, with multiple instances causing damages exceeding a billion USD, whereas storms have the greatest impact on people. Although it is not possible to directly attribute the natural disasters recorded in the S2iD database to the extreme weather events identified through meteorological data, discussion is done on potential implications of these events in the frequency and location of the disasters.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Robustness of Extreme Precipitation Super-Resolution Across Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles, complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional transformations, such as those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models offer quick approximations to complex numerical and experimental systems but typically lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While Bayesian methods provide uncertainty estimates, they offer no statistical guarantees and struggle with high-dimensional spatio-temporal problems due to computational costs. We present a conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides statistically guaranteed marginal coverage for surrogate models in a model-agnostic manner with near-zero computational cost. Our approach handles high-dimensional spatio-temporal outputs by performing cell-wise calibration while preserving the tensorial structure of predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse applications including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, weather forecasting, and fusion diagnostics, we demonstrate that CP achieves empirical coverage with valid error bars regardless of model architecture, training regime, or output dimensionality. We evaluate three nonconformity scores (conformalised quantile regression, absolute error residual, and standard deviation) for both deterministic and probabilistic models, showing that guaranteed coverage holds even for out-of-distribution predictions where models are deployed on physics regimes different from training data. Calibration requires only seconds to minutes on standard hardware. The framework enables rigorous validation of pre-trained surrogate models for downstream applications without retraining. While CP provides marginal rather than conditional coverage and assumes exchangeability between calibration and test data, our method circumvents the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, offering a practical tool for trustworthy deployment of machine learning in physical sciences.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the soil and atmospheric stress on carbon sequestration in a Mediterranean pine forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$ in a Mediterranean semi-arid Aleppo Pine Forest (Pinus halepensis) close to the border of the semi-arid timberline was characterized and quantified under field conditions. Measurements of organic and inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration with gas exchange and stock counting approaches were made in both rainfed control (approximately 12$\%$ average annual soil moisture) and summer irrigated plots (approximately 24$\%$ annual average soil moisture), providing the opportunity to separate the effects of atmospheric water demand from soil water stress on the atmospheric CO$_2$ sequestration responses. Measurements yield an organic carbon sequestration (OCS) rate of approximately 550 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, two-thirds in soil and one-third in biomass. In addition, measurements yield an inorganic carbon sequestration (ICS) rate of approximately 216 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$; via calcite (CaCO$_3$) precipitation in the soil due to root exhalation of CO$_2$ (60$\%$) and microbial activity (40$\%$). The drip irrigated plot showed approximately 3 times higher organic CO$_2$ sequestration than the control plot. The organic sequestration is divided equally between the soil and the biomass. For the irrigated plot, the inorganic CO$_2$ was approximately 1.8 times higher than that of the control plot. However, for inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration, the soil moisture would need to be maintained lower than that of the study plot to preclude dissolving precipitated calcite. For many drylands, irrigation could be achieved by using fossil water reserves. These measured values demonstrate the relatively high potential carbon sequestration in Mediterranean drylands forests under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions.</description>
