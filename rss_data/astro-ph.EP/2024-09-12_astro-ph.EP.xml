      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Design, scientific goals, and performance of the SCExAO survey for planets around accelerating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the motivation, design, and early results for our 42-night, 125 star Subaru/SCExAO direct imaging survey for planets around accelerating stars. Unlike prior large surveys, ours focuses only on stars showing evidence for an astrometric acceleration plausibly due to the dynamical pull of an unseen planet or brown dwarf. Our program is motivated by results from a recent pilot program that found the first planet jointly discovered from direct imaging and astrometry and resulted in a planet and brown dwarf discovery rate substantially higher than previous unbiased surveys like GPIES. The first preliminary results from our program reveal multiple new companions; discovered planets and brown dwarfs can be further characterized with follow-up data, including higher-resolution spectra. Finally, we describe the critical role this program plays in supporting the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraphic Instrument, providing a currently-missing list of targets suitable for the CGI technological demonstration without which the CGI tech demo risks failure.</description>

      <title>The HD 191939 Exoplanet System is Well-Aligned and Flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$ for HD 191939 b, the innermost planet in a 6 planet system, using Keck/KPF to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Planet b is a sub-Neptune with radius 3.4 $\pm$ 0.8 R$_{\oplus}$ and mass 10.0 $\pm$ 0.7 M$_{\oplus}$ with an RM amplitude $&lt;$1 ms$^{-1}$. We find the planet is consistent with a well-aligned orbit, measuring $\lambda= \, $ 3.7 $\pm$ 5.0 degrees. Additionally, we place new constraints on the mass and period of the distant super-Jupiter, planet f, finding it to be 2.88 $\pm$ 0.26 $M_J$ on a 2898 $\pm$ 152 day orbit. With these new orbital parameters, we perform a dynamical analysis of the system and constrain the mutual inclination of the non-transiting planet e to be smaller than 12 degrees relative to the plane shared by the inner three transiting planets. Additionally, the further planet f is inclined off this shared plane, the greater the amplitude of precession for the entire inner system, making it increasingly unlikely to measure an aligned orbit for planet b. Through this analysis, we show that this system's wide variety of planets are all well-aligned with the star and nearly co-planar, suggesting that the system formed dynamically cold and flat out of a well-aligned proto-planetary disk, similar to our own solar system.</description>

      <title>A photochemical PHO network for hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the detection of phosphine PH3 in the Solar System gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, a direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at Solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at Solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times Solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.</description>

      <title>Earth's Mesosphere During Possible Encounters With Massive Interstellar Clouds 2 and 7 Million Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting $\sim10^5$ years. Polar mesospheric ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving outgoing longwave radiation.</description>

      <title>The young exoplanetary system TOI-4562: Confirming the presence of a third body in the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young planetary systems represent an opportunity to investigate the early stages of (exo)planetary formation because the gravitational interactions have not yet significantly changed the initial configuration of the system. TOI-4562 b is a highly eccentric temperate Jupiter analogue orbiting a young F7V-type star of $&lt;700$ Myr in age with an orbital period of $P_{orb} \sim 225$ days and an eccentricity of $e=0.76$, and is one of the largest known exoplanets to have formed in situ. We observed a new transit of TOI-4562 b using the 0.6-m Zeiss telescope at the Pico dos Dias Observatory (OPD/LNA) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and combine our data with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and archive data, with the aim being to improve the ephemerides of this interesting system. The $O-C$ diagram for the new ephemeris is consistent with the presence of a giant planet in an outer orbit around TOI-4562. TOI-4562 c is a planet with a mass of $M=5.77 M_{Jup}$, an orbital period of $P_{orb}= 3990$ days, and a semi-major axis of $a = 5.219$ AU. We report the discovery of TOI-4562 c, the exoplanet with the longest orbital period discovered to date via the transit timing variation (TTV) method. The TOI-4562 system is in the process of violent evolution with intense dynamical changes - judging by its young age and high eccentricity - and is therefore a prime target for studies of formation and evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The K2 and TESS Synergy III: search and rescue of the lost ephemeris for K2's first planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-2 b/HIP 116454 b, the first exoplanet discovery by K2 during its Two-Wheeled Concept Engineering Test, is a sub-Neptune (2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 $R_\oplus$, 9.7 $\pm$ 1.2 $M_\oplus$) orbiting a relatively bright (KS = 8.03) K-dwarf on a 9.1 day period. Unfortunately, due to a spurious follow-up transit detection and ephemeris degradation, the transit ephemeris for this planet was lost. In this work, we recover and refine the transit ephemeris for K2-2 b, showing a $\sim40{\sigma}$ discrepancy from the discovery results. To accurately measure the transit ephemeris and update the parameters of the system, we jointly fit space-based photometric observations from NASA's K2, TESS, and Spitzer missions with new photometric observations from the ground, as well as radial velocities from HARPS-N that are corrected for stellar activity using a new modeling technique. Ephemerides becoming lost or significantly degraded, as is the case for most transiting planets, highlights the importance of systematically updating transit ephemerides with upcoming large efforts expected to characterize hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres. K2-2 b sits at the high-mass peak of the known radius valley for sub-Neptunes, and is now well-suited for transmission spectroscopy with current and future facilities. Our updated transit ephemeris will ensure no more than a 13-minute uncertainty through 2030.</description>

      <title>The early Solar System and its meteoritical witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteorites, and in particular primitive meteorites (chondrites), are irreplaceable probes of the solar protoplanetary disk. We review their essential properties and endeavour to place them in astrophysical context. The earliest solar system solids, refractory inclusions, may have formed over the innermost au of the disk and have been transported outward by its expansion or turbulent diffusion. The age spread of chondrite components may be reconciled with the tendency of drag-induced radial drift if they were captured in pressure maxima, which may account for the non-carbonaceous/carbonaceous meteorite isotopic dichotomy. The solid/gas ratio around unity witnessed by chondrules, if interpreted as nebular (non-impact) products, suggests efficient radial concentration and settling at such locations, conducive to planetesimal formation by the streaming instability. The cause of the pressure bumps, e.g. Jupiter or condensation lines, remains to be ascertained.</description>

      <title>Detectability Simulations of a NIR Surface Biosignature on Proxima Centauri b with Future Space Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telescope missions are currently being designed which will make direct imaging of habitable exoplanets possible in the near future, and studies are needed to quantify the detectability of biosignature features in the planet's reflectance spectrum. We simulated the detectability of a NIR-absorbing surface biosignature feature with simulated observations of the nearby exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. We modeled a biosignature spectral feature with a reflectance spectrum based on an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial species that has strong absorption at 1 um, which could make it well suited for life on an M-dwarf hosted planet. We modeled the distribution of this organism across the planet's surface based on climate states from a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), which were Archean and Proterozoic-like exo-Earth analogues. We included the GCM runs' prognostically simulated water clouds and added organic haze into the Archean-like atmospheres. We simulated observations of these Proxima Centauri b scenarios with the LUVOIR-A and B telescope concepts, with LUVOIR-B serving as a proxy to the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We calculated integration times necessary to detect the biosignature, and found that it would be detectable on Proxima Centauri b if the organism is moderately abundant (greater than a 1-4% global surface area coverage), as long as the atmosphere is transmitting in the wavelength range under consideration. Small amounts of methane, clouds, and haze do not greatly impede detectability. We found preliminary evidence that such a biosignature would be detectable on exoplanets within 15 pc, but further investigations are needed to corroborate this.</description>

      <title>Validation of up to seven TESS planet candidates through multi-colour transit photometry using MuSCAT2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TESS mission searches for transiting exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars across the entire sky. M-type planet hosts are ideal targets for this mission due to their smaller size and cooler temperatures, which makes it easier to detect smaller planets near or within their habitable zones. Additionally, M~dwarfs have a smaller contrast ratio between the planet and the star, making it easier to measure the planet's properties accurately. Here, we report the validation analysis of 13 TESS exoplanet candidates orbiting around M dwarfs. We studied the nature of these candidates through a multi-colour transit photometry transit analysis using several ground-based instruments (MuSCAT2, MuSCAT3, and LCO-SINISTRO), high-spatial resolution observations, and TESS light curves. We present the validation of five new planetary systems: TOI-1883b, TOI-2274b, TOI2768b, TOI-4438b, and TOI-5319b, along with compelling evidence of a planetary nature for TOIs 2781b and 5486b. We also present an empirical definition for the Neptune desert boundaries. The remaining six systems could not be validated due to large true radius values overlapping with the brown dwarf regime or, alternatively, the presence of chromaticity in the MuSCAT2 light curves.</description>

      <title>Size distribution of small grains in the inner zodiacal cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft has transited the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud and detects impacts to the spacecraft body via its electric field instrument. Multiple dust populations have been proposed to explain the PSP dust impact rates. PSP's unique orbit allows us to identify a region where the impact rates are likely dominated by $\alpha$-meteoroids, small zodiacal grains on approximately circular, bound orbits. From the distribution of voltage signals generated by dust impacts to PSP in this region, we find the cumulative mass index for grains with radii of $\sim$0.6-1.4 $\mu$m (masses of $3\times10^{-15}$ to $3\times10^{-14}$ kg) to be $\alpha = 1.1 \pm 0.3$ from 0.1-0.25 $R_\odot$. $\alpha$ increases toward the Sun, with even smaller fragments generated closer to the Sun. The derived size distribution is steeper than previously estimated, and in contrast to expectations we find most of the dust mass resides in the smallest fragments and not in large grains inside 0.15 au. As the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud are likely collisionally evolved, these results place new constraints how the solar system's zodiacal cloud and by extension astrophysical debris disks are partitioned in mass.</description>

      <title>The only inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary: WD1032+011B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their short orbital periods and relatively high flux ratios, irradiated brown dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs offer better opportunities to study irradiated atmospheres than hot Jupiters, which have lower planet-to-star flux ratios. WD1032+011 is an eclipsing, tidally locked white dwarf-brown dwarf binary with a 9950 K white dwarf orbited by a 69.7 M$_{Jup}$ brown dwarf in a 0.09 day orbit. We present time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrophotometric data of WD1032+011. We isolate the phase-dependent spectra of WD1032+011B, finding a 210 K difference in brightness temperature between the dayside and nightside. The spectral type of the brown dwarf is identified as L1 peculiar, with atmospheric retrievals and comparison to field brown dwarfs showing evidence for a cloud-free atmosphere. The retrieved temperature of the dayside is $1748^{+66}_{-67}$ K, with a nightside temperature of $1555^{+76}_{-62}$ K, showing an irradiation-driven temperature contrast coupled with inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. The brown dwarf radius is inflated, likely due to the constant irradiation from the white dwarf, making it the only known inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sub-Kelvin Variations in Stellar Temperature with High-Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of stellar variability often relies on the measurement of selected activity indicators such as coronal emission lines and non-thermal emissions. On the flip side, the effective stellar temperature is normally seen as one of the key fundamental parameters (with mass and radius) to understanding the basic physical nature of a star and its relation with its environment (e.g., planetary instellation). We present a novel approach for measuring disk-averaged temperature variations to sub-Kelvin accuracy inspired by algorithms developed for precision radial velocity. This framework uses the entire content of the spectrum, not just pre-identified lines, and can be applied to existing data obtained with high-resolution spectrographs. We demonstrate the framework by recovering the known rotation periods and temperature modulation of Barnard star and AU Mic in datasets obtained in the infrared with SPIRou at CHFT and at optical wavelengths on $\epsilon$ Eridani with HARPS at ESO 3.6-m telescope. We use observations of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733\,b, obtained with SPIRou, to show that this method can unveil the minute temperature variation signature expected during the transit event, an effect analogous to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect but in temperature space. This method is a powerful new tool for characterizing stellar activity, and in particular temperature and magnetic features at the surfaces of cool stars, affecting both precision radial velocity and transit spectroscopic observations. We demonstrate the method in the context of high-resolution spectroscopy but the method could be used at lower resolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar energetic particle and cosmic ray effects in exoplanetary atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic particles, in the form of stellar energetic particles and cosmic rays, can lead to disequilibrium chemical effects in exoplanetary atmospheres. In Earth-like atmospheres, energetic particles can drive the formation of prebiotic molecules, the building blocks of life. Here instead, I study the transport of energetic particles through a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmosphere and calculate the resulting ionisation rate of molecular hydrogen using a Monte Carlo energetic particle transport model. I focus on a GJ436 b-like atmosphere at orbital distances between 0.01-0.2 au which includes the orbital distance of the exoplanet GJ436 b (0.028 au). I found that stellar energetic particles lead to high ionisation rates in a GJ436 b-like atmosphere between 0.01-0.2 au. These results motivate the use of chemical models of gas giant atmospheres including energetic particle ionisation to ultimately produce synthetic James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel transmission spectra in the future.</description>

      <title>A Geodetic and Astrometric VLBI Experiment at 22/43/88/132 GHz</title>

Abstract: Extending geodetic and astrometric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations from traditional centimeter wavebands to millimeter wavebands offers numerous scientific potentials and benefits. However, it was considered quite challenging due to various factors, including the increased effects of atmospheric opacity and turbulence at millimeter wavelengths. Here, we present the results of the first geodetic-mode VLBI experiment, simultaneously observing 82 sources at 22/43/88/132 GHz (K/Q/W/D bands) using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). We introduced the frequency phase transfer (FPT) method to geodetic VLBI analysis, an approach for calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at higher frequencies by transferring phase solutions from lower frequencies. With a 2-minute scan, FPT improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of most fringes, some by over 100%, thereby enhancing the detection rate of weak sources at millimeter wavebands. Additionally, FPT reduced systematic errors in group delay and delay rate, with the weighted root-mean-squares (WRMS) of the post-fitting residuals decreasing from 25.0 ps to 20.5 ps at the W band and from 39.3 ps to 27.6 ps at the D band. There were no notable differences observed in calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at the K band (WRMS = 12.4 ps) and Q band (WRMS = 11.8 ps) with the KVN baselines. This experiment demonstrated that the millimeter waveband can be used for geodetic and astrometric applications with high precision.</description>

      <title>Updated Catalog of Kepler Planet Candidates: Focus on Accuracy and Orbital Periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new catalog of Kepler planet candidates that prioritizes accuracy of planetary dispositions and properties over uniformity. This catalog contains 4376 transiting planet candidates, including 1791 residing within 709 multi-planet systems, and provides the best parameters available for a large sample of Kepler planet candidates. We also provide a second set of stellar and planetary properties for transiting candidates that are uniformly-derived for use in occurrence rates studies. Estimates of orbital periods have been improved, but as in previous catalogs, our tabulated values for period uncertainties do not fully account for transit timing variations (TTVs). We show that many planets are likely to have TTVs with long periodicities caused by various processes, including orbital precession, and that such TTVs imply that ephemerides of Kepler planets are not as accurate on multi-decadal timescales as predicted by the small formal errors (typically 1 part in $10^6$ and rarely $ &gt; 10^{-5}$) in the planets' measured mean orbital periods during the Kepler epoch. Analysis of normalized transit durations implies that eccentricities of planets are anti-correlated with the number of companion transiting planets. Our primary catalog lists all known Kepler planet candidates that orbit and transit only one star; for completeness, we also provide an abbreviated listing of the properties of the two dozen non-transiting planets that have been identified around stars that host transiting planets discovered by Kepler.</description>

      <title>Outcomes of Sub-Neptune Collisions</title>

Abstract: Observed high multiplicity planetary systems are often tightly packed. Numerical studies indicate that such systems are susceptible to dynamical instabilities. Dynamical instabilities in close-in tightly packed systems, similar to those found in abundance by Kepler, often lead to planet-planet collisions. For sub-Neptunes, the dominant type of observed exoplanets, the planetary mass is concentrated in a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by a low-density gaseous envelope. For these, using the traditional perfect merger assumption to resolve collisions is questionable. Using both N-body integration and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, we have simulated sub-Neptune collisions for a wide range of impact parameters ($b^{\prime}$) and impact velocities ($v_{\rm{im}}$) to study the possible outcomes in detail. We find that the majority of the collisions with kinematic properties similar to what is expected from dynamical instabilities in multiplanet systems may not lead to mergers of sub-Neptunes. Instead, both sub-Neptunes survive the encounter, often with significant atmosphere loss. When mergers do occur, they can involve significant mass loss and can sometimes lead to complete disruption of one or both planets. Sub-Neptunes merge or disrupt if $b^{\prime}&lt;b_{\rm{c}}^{\prime}$, a critical value dependent on $v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, where $v_{\rm{esc}}$ is the escape velocity from the surface of the hypothetical merged planet assuming perfect merger. For $v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\lesssim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}^{\prime}\propto(v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}})^{-2}$, and collisions with $b^{\prime}&lt;b_{\rm{c}}^{\prime}$ typically leads to mergers. On the other hand, for $v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\gtrsim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}^{\prime}\propto v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, and the collisions with $b^{\prime}&lt;b_{\rm{c}}^{\prime}$ can result in complete destruction of one or both sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of the Uranian satellite system I. From the 5/3 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance to the present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual gravitational interactions between the five major Uranian satellites raise small quasi-periodic fluctuations on their orbital elements. At the same time, tidal interactions between the satellites and the planet induce a slow outward drift of the orbits, while damping the eccentricities and the inclinations. In this paper, we revisit the current and near past evolution of this system using a $N-$body integrator, including spin evolution and tidal dissipation with the weak friction model. We update the secular eigenmodes of the system and show that it is unlikely that any of the main satellites were recently captured into a high obliquity Cassini state. We rather expect that the Uranian satellites are in a low obliquity Cassini state and compute their values. We also estimate the current variations in the eccentricities and inclinations, and show that they are not fully damped. We constrain the modified quality factor of Uranus to be $Q_U' = ( 1.2 \pm 0.4 ) \times 10^5$, and that of Ariel to be $ Q_A' = (7 \pm 3) \times 10^4 $. We find that the system most likely encountered the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel in the past, at about $(0.7 \pm 0.2)$ Gyr ago. We additionally determine the eccentricities and inclinations of all satellites just after the resonance passage that comply with the current system. We finally show that, from the crossing of the 5/3 MMR to the present, the evolution of the system is mostly peaceful and dominated by tides raised on Uranus by the satellites.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of the Uranian satellite system II. Crossing of the 5/3 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, the main satellites of Uranus are not involved in any low order mean motion resonance (MMR). However, owing to tides raised in the planet, Ariel and Umbriel most likely crossed the 5/3 MMR in the past. Previous studies on this resonance passage relied on limited time-consuming $N-$body simulations or simplified models focusing solely on the effects of the eccentricity or the inclination. In this paper, we aim to provide a more comprehensive view on how the system evaded capture in the 5/3 MMR. For that purpose, we developed a secular resonant two-satellite model with low eccentricities and low inclinations, including tides using the weak friction model. By performing a large number of numerical simulations, we show that capture in the 5/3 MMR is certain if the initial eccentricities of Ariel, $e_1$, and Umbriel, $e_2$, are related through $(e_1^2 + e_2^2)^{1/2} &lt; 0.007$. Moreover, we observe that the eccentricity of Ariel is the key variable to evade the 5/3 MMR with a high probability. We determine that for $e_1 &gt; 0.015$ and $e_2 &lt; 0.01$, the system avoids capture in at least $60\%$ of the cases. We also show that, to replicate the currently observed system, the initial inclinations of Ariel and Umbriel must lay within $I_1 \le 0.05^{\circ}$ and $0.06^{\circ} \le I_2 \le 0.11^{\circ}$, respectively. We checked these results using a complete $N-$body model with the five main satellites and did not observe any significant differences.</description>

      <title>Searching for Stellar Activity Cycles using Flares: The Short and Long Timescale Activity Variations of TIC-272272592</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine 4 years of Kepler 30-min data, and 5 Sectors of TESS 2-min data for the dM3 star KIC-8507979/TIC-272272592. This rapidly rotating (P=1.2 day) star has previously been identified as flare active, with a possible long-term decline in its flare output. Such slow changes in surface magnetic activity are potential indicators of Solar-like activity cycles, which can yield important information about the structure of the stellar dynamo. We find that while TIC-272272592 shows evidence for both short and long timescale variations in its flare activity, it is unlikely physically motivated. Only a handful of stars have been subjected to such long baseline point-in-time flare studies, and we urge caution in comparing results between telescopes due to differences in bandpass, signal to noise, and cadence. In this work, we develop an approach to measure variations in the flare frequency distributions over time, which is quantified as a function of the observing baseline. For TIC-272272592, we find a $2.7\sigma$ detection of a Sector which has a flare deficit, therefore indicating the short term variation could be a result of sampling statistics. This quantifiable approach to describing flare rate variation is a powerful new method for measuring the months-to-years changes in surface magnetic activity, and provides important constraints on activity cycles and dynamo models for low mass stars.</description>
