      <title>Multivariate Analysis of Gut Microbiota Composition and Prevalence of Gastric Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global surge in the cases of gastric cancer has prompted an investigation into the potential of gut microbiota as a predictive marker for the disease. The alterations in gut diversity are suspected to be associated with an elevated risk of gastric cancer. This paper delves into finding the correlation between gut microbiota and gastric cancer, focusing on patients who have undergone total and subtotal gastrectomy. Utilizing data mining and statistical learning methods, an analysis was conducted on 16S-RNA sequenced genes obtained from 96 participants with the aim of identifying specific genera of gut microbiota associated with gastric cancer. The study reveals several prominent bacterial genera that could potentially serve as biomarkers assessing the risk of gastric cancer. These findings offer a pathway for early risk assessment and precautionary measures in the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The intricate mechanisms through which these gut microbiotas influence gastric cancer progression warrant further investigation. This research significantly aims to contribute to the growing understanding of the gut-cancer axis and its implications in disease prediction and prevention.</description>

      <title>PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</description>

      <title>Pathway Tools version 28.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome Informatics and Systems Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03964v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathway Tools is a bioinformatics software environment with a broad set of capabilities. The software provides genome-informatics tools such as a genome browser, sequence alignments, a genome-variant analyzer, and comparative-genomics operations. It offers metabolic-informatics tools, such as metabolic reconstruction, quantitative metabolic modeling, prediction of reaction atom mappings, and metabolic route search. Pathway Tools also provides regulatory-informatics tools, such as the ability to represent and visualize a wide range of regulatory interactions. The software creates and manages a type of organism-specific database called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB), which the software enables database curators to interactively edit. It supports web publishing of PGDBs and provides a large number of query, visualization, and omics-data analysis tools. Scientists around the world have created more than 45,000 PGDBs by using Pathway Tools, many of which are curated databases for important model organisms. Those PGDBs can be exchanged using a peer-to-peer database-sharing system called the PGDB Registry.</description>

      <title>OmniGenome: Aligning RNA Sequences with Secondary Structures in Genomic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alignment between RNA sequences and structures in foundation models (FMs) has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</description>
