      <title>HyperFusion: Hierarchical Multimodal Ensemble Learning for Social Media Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track).

      <title>Leveraging Unlabeled Audio-Visual Data in Speech Emotion Recognition using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However, collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER (LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.</description>

      <title>Beat and Downbeat Tracking in Performance MIDI Using an End-to-End Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for enhanced music analysis and score generation.</description>

      <title>MuteSwap: Silent Face-based Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.</description>

      <title>MVP: Winning Solution to SMP Challenge 2025 Video Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms serve as central hubs for content dissemination, opinion expression, and public engagement across diverse modalities. Accurately predicting the popularity of social media videos enables valuable applications in content recommendation, trend detection, and audience engagement. In this paper, we present Multimodal Video Predictor (MVP), our winning solution to the Video Track of the SMP Challenge 2025. MVP constructs expressive post representations by integrating deep video features extracted from pretrained models with user metadata and contextual information. The framework applies systematic preprocessing techniques, including log-transformations and outlier removal, to improve model robustness. A gradient-boosted regression model is trained to capture complex patterns across modalities. Our approach ranked first in the official evaluation of the Video Track, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for multimodal video popularity prediction on social platforms.

      <title>Contrastive Conditional Latent Diffusion for Audio-visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a contrastive conditional latent diffusion model for audio-visual segmentation (AVS) to thoroughly investigate the impact of audio, where the correlation between audio and the final segmentation map is modeled to guarantee the strong correlation between them. To achieve semantic-correlated representation learning, our framework incorporates a latent diffusion model. The diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map, resulting in ground-truth aware inference during the denoising process at the test stage. As our model is conditional, it is vital to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to the model output. We thus extensively model the contribution of the audio signal by minimizing the density ratio between the conditional probability of the multimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio-visual data, and that of the unimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio data only. In this way, our latent diffusion model via density ratio optimization explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for AVS, which can then be achieved with contrastive learning as a constraint, where the diffusion part serves as the main objective to achieve maximum likelihood estimation, and the density ratio optimization part imposes the constraint. By adopting this latent diffusion model via contrastive learning, we effectively enhance the contribution of audio for AVS. The effectiveness of our solution is validated through experimental results on the benchmark dataset.

      <title>Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

      <title>Enabling Collaborative Parametric Knowledge Calibration for Retrieval-Augmented Vision Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) systems address complex visual-grounded questions with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases. The tasks of knowledge retrieval and answer generation tasks both necessitate precise multimodal understanding of question context and external knowledge. However, existing methods treat these two stages as separate modules with limited interaction during training, which hinders bi-directional parametric knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance. To fully exploit the cross-task synergy in KB-VQA, we propose a unified retrieval-augmented VQA framework with collaborative parametric knowledge calibration. The proposed framework can effectively adapt general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained, knowledge-intensive tasks while enabling the retriever and generator to collaboratively enhance and share their parametric knowledge during both training and inference. To enhance fine-grained understanding of questions and external documents, we also integrate late interaction mechanism into the proposed training framework. Additionally, we introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary. Our approach achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models, delivering a significant 4.7\% improvement in answering accuracy, and brings an average 7.5\% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.</description>

      <title>ICME 2025 Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-, bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration. This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor, providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks: general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.</description>
