      <title>Long-time propagation of chaos and exit times for metastable mean-field particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of stochastic particles evolving in a multi-well energy landscape and attracted to their barycenter is the prototypical example of mean-field process undergoing phase transitions: at low temperature, the corresponding mean-field deterministic limit has several stationary solutions, and the empirical measure of the particle system is then expected to be a metastable process in the space of probability measures, exhibiting rare transitions between the vicinity of these stationary solutions. We show two results in this direction: first, the exit time from such metastable domains occurs at time exponentially large with the number of particles and follows approximately an exponential distribution; second, up to the expected exit time, the joint law of particles remain close to the law of independent non-linear McKean-Vlasov processes.</description>

      <title>Stability of H\"older regularity and weighted functional inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces, which may possess both strongly local and pure-jump parts. We introduce a new formulation of a tail condition for jump measures and weighted functional inequalities. Our framework accommodates Dirichlet forms with singular jump measures and those associated with trace processes of mixed-type stable processes. Using these new weighted functional inequalities, we establish stable, equivalent characterizations of H\"older regularity for caloric and harmonic functions. As an application of our main result, we prove the H\"older continuity of caloric functions for a large class of symmetric Markov processes exhibiting boundary blow-up behavior, among other results.</description>

      <title>On some properties of a positive linear operator via the Moran model in population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a positive linear operator acting on the Banach space of all continuous functions on the unit interval via the Moran model studied in population genetics. We show that this operator, named the Moran operator, uniformly approximates every continuous function on the unit interval. Furthermore, some limit theorems for the iterates of the Moran operator are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a path-kernel formula for the linear response of SDEs, where the perturbation applies to initial conditions, drift coefficients, and diffusion coefficients. It tempers the unstableness by gradually moving the path-perturbation to hit the probability kernel. Then we derive a pathwise sampling algorithm and demonstrate it on the Lorenz 96 system with noise.</description>

      <title>Ancestral lineages and sampling in populations with density-dependent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a density-dependent Markov jump process describing a population where each individual is characterized by a type, and reproduces at rates depending both on its type and on the population type distribution. First, using an appropriate change in probability, we exhibit a time-inhomogeneous Markov process, the auxiliary process, which allows to capture the behavior of a sampled lineage in the population process. This is achieved through a many-to-one formula, which relates the average of a function over ancestral lineages sampled in the population processes to its average over the auxiliary process, yielding a direct interpretation of the underlying survivorship bias. In addition, this construction allows for more general sampling procedures than what was previously obtained in the literature, such as sampling restricted to subpopulations. Second, we consider the large population regime, when the population size grows to infinity. Under classical assumptions, the population type distribution can then be approached by a diffusion approximation, which captures the fluctuations of the population process around its deterministic large population limit. We establish a many-to-one formula allowing to sample in the diffusion approximation, and quantify the associated approximation error.</description>

      <title>An averaging principle for nonlinear parabolic PDEs via reflected FBSDEs driven by G-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the averaging problem for a class of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with reflection driven by G-Brownian motion (reflected G-FBSDEs), which corresponds to the singular perturbation problem of a kind of fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with a lower obstacle. The reflection keeps the solution above a given stochastic process. By the use of the nonlinear stochastic techniques and viscosity solution methods, we prove that the limit distribution of solution is the unique viscosity solution of an obstacle problem for a fully nonlinear parabolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Foundations of regular variation on topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its introduction by J. Karamata, regular variation has evolved from a purely mathematical concept into a cornerstone of theoretical probability and data analysis. It is extensively studied and applied in different areas. Its significance lies in characterising large deviations, determining the limits of partial sums, and predicting the long-term behaviour of extreme values in stochastic processes. Motivated by various applications, the framework of regular variation has expanded over time to incorporate random observations in more general spaces, including Banach spaces and Polish spaces.
  In this monograph, we identify three fundamental components of regular variation: scaling, boundedness, and the topology of the underlying space. We explore the role of each component in detail and extend a number of previously obtained results to general topological spaces. Our more abstract approach unifies various concepts appearing in the literature, streamlines existing proofs and paves the way for novel contributions, such as: a generalised theory of (hidden) regular variation for random measures and sets; an innovative treatment of regularly varying random functions and elements scaled by independent random quantities and numerous other advancements. Throughout the text, key results and definitions are illustrated by instructive examples, including extensions of several established models from the literature. By bridging abstraction with practicality, this work aims to deepen both theoretical understanding and methodological applicability of regular variation.</description>

      <title>Probability of Transition to Turbulence in a Reduced Stochastic Model of Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of turbulence initiation in pipe flow under different noise structures by estimating the probability of initiating metastable transitions. We establish lower bounds on turbulence transition probabilities using linearized models with multiplicative noise near the laminar state. First, we consider the case of stochastic perturbations by It\^o white noise; then, through the Stratonovich interpretation, we extend the analysis to noise types such as white and red noise in time. Our findings demonstrate the viability of detecting the onset of turbulence as rare events under diverse noise assumptions. The results also contribute to applied SPDE theory and offer valuable methodologies for understanding turbulence across application areas.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for the stochastic primitive equations in the large rotation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the unique ergodicity of the viscous primitive equations with additive white-in-time noise remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate that, as the rotational intensity approaches infinity, the distribution of any given strong solution, rescaled by the rotation, is attracted to the unique invariant measure of the stochastic limit resonant system. This suggests that the system exhibits nearly unique ergodicity in the large rotation limit. The proof is based on a stochastic averaging principle combined with a coupling argument.</description>

      <title>Tail Asymptotics of Cluster Sizes in Multivariate Heavy-Tailed Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a distributional fixed-point equation related to a multi-type branching process that is key in the cluster sizes analysis of multivariate heavy-tailed Hawkes processes. Specifically, we explore the tail behavior of its solution and demonstrate the emergence of a form of multivariate hidden regular variation. Large values of the cluster size vector result from one or several significant jumps; A discrete optimization problem involving any given rare event set of interest determines the exact configuration of these large jumps and the degree of hidden regular variation. Our proofs rely on a detailed probabilistic analysis of the spatiotemporal structure of multiple large jumps in multi-type branching processes.</description>

Abstract: It will be shown that transformations of order one on the Wiener space give rise to quadratic forms as exponents of change of variables formulas, and conversely every exponentially integrable quadratic form has a transformation of order one realizing the form in such a manner. Several expressions of corresponding change of variables formulas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Masses of blocks of the $\Lambda$-coalescent with dust via stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the masses of blocks of the $\Lambda$-coalescent with dust and some aspects of their large and small time behaviors. To do so, we start by associating the $\Lambda$-coalescent to a nested interval-partition constructed from the flow of inverses, introduced by Bertoin and Le Gall in [Ann. inst. Henri Poincare (B) Probab. Stat. 41(3), 307-333 (2003)], of the $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot flow, and prove Poisson representations for the masses of blocks in terms of the flow of inverses. The representations enable us to use the power of stochastic calculus to study the masses of blocks. We apply this method to study the long and small time behaviors. In particular, for all $k&gt;1$, we determine the decay rate of the expectation of the $k$-th largest block as time goes to infinity and find that a cut-off phenomenon, related to the presence of dust, occurs: the decay rate is increasing for small indices $k$ but remains constant after a fixed index depending on the measure $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities and large deviations for continuous greedy animals and paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the continuous greedy paths model: given a $d$-dimensional Poisson point process with positive marks interpreted as masses, let $\mathrm P(\ell)$ denote the maximum mass gathered by a path of length $\ell$ starting from the origin. It is known that $\mathrm P(\ell)/\ell converges a.s.\ to a deterministic constant $\mathrm P$. We show that the lower-tail deviation probability for $\mathrm P(\ell) has order $\mathrm{exp}(-\ell^2)$ and, under exponential moment assumption on the mass distribution, that the upper-tail deviation probability has order $\mathrm{exp}(-\ell)$. In the latter regime, we prove the existence and some properties -notably, convexity -of the corresponding rate function. An immediate corollary is the large deviation principle at speed $\ell$ for $\mathrm P(\ell)$. Along the proof we show an upper-tail concentration inequality in the case where marks are bounded. All of the above also holds for greedy animals and have versions where the paths or animals involved have two anchors instead of one.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems and lack thereof for a multilayer random walk mimicking human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous-time random walk model on an infinite multilayer structure inspired by transportation networks. Each layer is a copy of $\mathbb{R}^d$, indexed by a non-negative integer. A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere gravitating fluids. Least action principles and particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monge-Amp\`ere gravitation theory (MAG) was introduced by Brenier to obtain an approximate solution of the early Universe reconstruction problem. It is a modification of Newtonian gravitation which is based on quadratic optimal transport. Later, Brenier, then Ambrosio, Baradat and Brenier discovered a double large deviation principle for Brownian particles whose rate function is precisely MAG's action functional.
  In the present article, following Brenier we first recap MAG's theory. Then, we slightly extend it from particles to fluid. This allows us to revisit the Ambrosio-Baradat-Brenier particle system and propose another one which is easier to interpret and whose large deviation rate function is MAG's action functional for fluids.
  This model leads to a Gibbs conditioning principle that is an entropy minimization problem close to the Schr\"odinger problem. While the setting of the Schr\"odinger problem is a system of noninteracting particles, the particle system we work with is subject to some branching mechanism which regulates the thermal fluctuations and some quantum force which balances them.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and hyperfluctuations of random measures in commutative spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Bartlett spectral measure for isometrically invariant random measures on proper metric commutative spaces. When the underlying Gelfand pair corresponds to a higher-rank, connected, simple matrix Lie group with finite center and a maximal compact subgroup, we prove that the number variance is asymptotically bounded above, uniformly across all random measures, by the volume raised to a power strictly less than 2. On Euclidean and real hyperbolic spaces we define a notion of heat kernel hyperuniformity for random distributions that generalizes hyperuniformity of random measures, and we prove that every sufficiently well behaved spectral measure can be realized as the Bartlett spectral measure of an invariant Gaussian random distribution. We also compute Bartlett spectral measures for invariant determinantal point processes in commutative spaces, providing a spectral proof of hyperuniformity for infinite polyanalytic ensembles in the complex plane, as well as heat kernel non-hyperuniformity of the zero set of the standard hyperbolic Gaussian analytic function on the Poincar\'e disk.</description>

Abstract: In a country with multiple elections, it may be expedient to hold some or all of them on a common polling date. Our main result, Theorem C, is that under certain assumptions, an increase in the simultaneity of polling increases the likelihood of a sweep, i.e. the likelihood that a single party wins all the elections. We discuss the applicability of our result to the two most common real world electoral systems, namely first-past-the-post (most voters, including US and India) and party list proportional representation (most countries).
  We deduce Theorem C from a certain inequality proved in Theorem D, which is of independent interest. In particular, we connect our inequality to the Harris correlation inequality, which is a multivariate generalization of the Chebyshev sum inequality, and plays an important role in statistical mechanics and graph theory. More precisely, we show that Theorem D also implies Theorem F, which extends the domain of the Harris inequality to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <title>LSD of the Commutator of two data Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma_k^{1/2}Z_k$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma_k$ are $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrices that commute and are independent of the $Z_k$'s for $k=1,2$. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the joint spectral distribution of $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a system of Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = n^{-1}(X_1X_2^* + X_2X_1^*)$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <title>On Moment-Entropy inequalities in the space of matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of works, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang established what could be called affine information theory, which is the study of moment-entropy and Fisher-information-type inequalities that are invariant with respect to affine transformations for random vectors. Their set of tools stemmed from sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities in the $L^p$ Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex geometry they had established. In this work, we generalize the affine information theory to the setting of matrices. These inequalities on the space of $n\times m$ matrices are induced by the interaction between $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its Euclidean structure and $\mathbb{R}^m$ equipped with a pseudo-norm.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</description>

      <title>Splitting algorithms for paraxial and It\^o-Schr\"odinger models of wave propagation in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a full discretization procedure to solve wave beam propagation in random media modeled by a paraxial wave equation or an It\^o-Schr\"odinger stochastic partial differential equation. This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem. The analysis is based on equations satisfied by statistical moments in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger case and on integral (Duhamel) expansions for the paraxial model. Several numerical simulations illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>POSERS: Steganography-Driven Molecular Tagging Using Randomized DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses a significant challenge across multiple industries, leading to financial losses and health risks. While DNA-based molecular tagging has emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely on predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as sequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we introduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized Sequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences. POSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions within randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting attempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be adjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We mathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test, successfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our results highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution for secure product authentication.</description>

Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of the probability measure on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev{\'e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <title>Validity of the total quasi-steady-state approximation in stochastic biochemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic models for biochemical reaction networks are widely used to explore their complex dynamics but face significant challenges, including difficulties in determining rate constants and high computational costs. To address these issues, model reduction approaches based on deterministic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) have been employed, resulting in propensity functions in the form of deterministic non-elementary reaction functions, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation. In particular, the total QSSA (tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived as universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies have challenged this perception. In this review, we demonstrate that applying tQSSA in stochastic model reduction can distort dynamics, even in cases where the deterministic tQSSA is rigorously valid. This highlights the need for caution when using deterministic QSSA in stochastic model reduction to avoid erroneous conclusions from model simulations.</description>

      <title>Taming Infinity one Chunk at a Time: Concisely Represented Strategies in One-Counter MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a canonical model to reason about decision making within a stochastic environment. We study a fundamental class of infinite MDPs: one-counter MDPs (OC-MDPs). They extend finite MDPs via an associated counter taking natural values, thus inducing an infinite MDP over the set of configurations (current state and counter value). We consider two characteristic objectives: reaching a target state (state-reachability), and reaching a target state with counter value zero (selective termination). The synthesis problem for the latter is not known to be decidable and connected to major open problems in number theory. Furthermore, even seemingly simple strategies (e.g., memoryless ones) in OC-MDPs might be impossible to build in practice (due to the underlying infinite configuration space): we need finite, and preferably small, representations.
  To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two natural classes of concisely represented strategies based on a (possibly infinite) partition of counter values in intervals. For both classes, and both objectives, we study the verification problem (does a given strategy ensure a high enough probability for the objective?), and two synthesis problems (does there exist such a strategy?): one where the interval partition is fixed as input, and one where it is only parameterized. We develop a generic approach based on a compression of the induced infinite MDP that yields decidability in all cases, with all complexities within PSPACE.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Energy Market Contracts: Dynkin Game with Doubly RBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a Contract for Difference (CfD) with early exit options, a widely used risk management instrument in electricity markets. The contract involves a producer and a regulatory entity, both of whom can strategically exit based on evolving market conditions. The problem is formulated as a two-player Dynkin game, where electricity prices follow a mean-reverting stochastic process, and contract terminations incur penalties. The strategic interaction is modeled using Doubly Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (DRBSDEs), which characterize the fair value of the contract and optimal exit strategies. To solve the DRBSDEs, we develop a deep learning-based numerical method, leveraging neural networks for efficient approximation. The results provide insights into the role of exit penalties, price volatility, and market dynamics in optimizing CfD agreements, offering practical implications for policymakers and market participants.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time mean field games: a primal-dual characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a primal-dual formulation for continuous-time mean field games (MFGs) and provides a complete analytical characterization of the set of all Nash equilibria (NEs). We first show that for any given mean field flow, the representative player's control problem with {\it measurable coefficients} is equivalent to a linear program over the space of occupation measures. We then establish the dual formulation of this linear program as a maximization problem over smooth subsolutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which plays a fundamental role in characterizing NEs of MFGs. Finally, a complete characterization of \emph{all NEs for MFGs} is established by the strong duality between the linear program and its dual problem. This strong duality is obtained by studying the solvability of the dual problem, and in particular through analyzing the regularity of the associated HJB equation.
  Compared with existing approaches for MFGs, the primal-dual formulation and its NE characterization do not require the convexity of the associated Hamiltonian or the uniqueness of its optimizer, and remain applicable when the HJB equation lacks classical or even continuous solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a lower bound for the Cheeger constant and the spectral gap for random complex curves in $\C P^2$. The complex curve is endowed with the restriction of the ambient Fubini-Study metric, and the probability measure is the Gaussian measure induced by the $\mathscr{L}^2$-Hermitian product on the space of complex homogeneous polynomialsof degree $d$ in $3$ variables. The proof relies on our previous  bounds for the systole and the curvature of random complex curves, together with an isoperimetric inequality for small ovals on complex curves. More generally, we establish such lower bounds for random complex curves within complex projective manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study conformal integrators for linearly damped stochastic Poisson systems. We analyse the qualitative and quantitative properties of these numerical integrators: preservation of dynamics of certain Casimir and Hamiltonian functions, almost sure bounds of the numerical solutions, and strong and weak rates of convergence under appropriate conditions. These theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments on, for example, the linearly damped free rigid body with random inertia tensor or the linearly damped stochastic Lotka--Volterra system.</description>

As opposed to Hairer's more extrinsic tree-based setting, due to the intrinsic description encoded by multi-indices, it is not possible to obtain a solution theory via the standard fixed-point argument. Instead, we develop a more intrinsic approach for existence using a variant of the continuity method from classical PDE theory based on a priori estimates for a new `robust' formulation of the equation. This formulation also allows us to obtain uniqueness of solutions and continuity of the solution map in the model norm even at the limit of vanishing regularisation scale. Since our proof relies on the structure of the nonlinearity in only a mild way, we expect the same ideas to be sufficient to treat a more general class of equations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Theory for High-Dimensional Rank One Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a pseudo-likelihood theory for rank one matrix estimation problems in the high dimensional limit. We prove a variational principle for the limiting pseudo-maximum likelihood which also characterizes the performance of the corresponding pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator. We show that this variational principle is universal and depends only on four parameters determined by the corresponding null model. Through this universality, we introduce a notion of equivalence for estimation problems of this type and, in particular, show that a broad class of estimation tasks, including community detection, sparse submatrix detection, and non-linear spiked matrix models, are equivalent to spiked matrix models. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the performance of the least-squares (or ``best rank one'') estimator for any rank one matrix estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Law of large numbers for a finite-range random walk in a dynamic random environment with nonuniform mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study random walks evolving on Z in a dynamic random environment that we assume to have time correlations that decrease polynomially fast. We show a law of large numbers by generalizing methods already used for the nearest-neighbor framework to the finite-range one. This requires some new ideas to get around the absence of a monotonicity property that was crucial in the proof for the nearest-neighbour case. Our proof works both in discrete and continuous time.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d&gt;4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of the self-avoiding walk and its finite-memory version, known as the memory-$\tau$ walk, which prohibits loops whose length is at most $\tau$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$. The critical point is defined as the radius of convergence of the generating function for each model. It is known that the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk is non-decreasing in $\tau$ and converges to that of the self-avoiding walk as $\tau$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we study the rate at which the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk converges to that of the self-avoiding walk and show that the order is $\tau^{-(d-2)/2}$. The proof relies on the lace expansion, introduced by Brydges and Spencer.</description>

      <title>Laws of the iterated and single logarithm for sums of independent indicators, with applications to the Ginibre point process and Karlin's occupancy scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for an infinite sum of independent indicators parameterized by $t$ as $t\to\infty$. It is shown that if the expectation $b$ and the variance $a$ of the sum are comparable, then the normalization in the LIL includes the iterated logarithm of $a$. If the expectation grows faster than the variance, while the ratio $\log b/\log a$ remains bounded, then the normalization in the LIL includes the single logarithm of $a$ (so that the LIL becomes a law of the single logarithm). Applications of our result are given to the number of points of the infinite Ginibre point process in a disk and the number of occupied boxes and related quantities in Karlin's occupancy scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contractive coupling rates have been recently introduced by Conforti as a tool to establish convex Sobolev inequalities (including modified log-Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequality) for some classes of Markov chains. In this work, we show how contractive coupling rates can also be used to prove stronger inequalities, in the form of curvature lower bounds for Markov chains and geodesic convexity of entropic functionals. We illustrate this in several examples discussed by Conforti, where in particular, after appropriately choosing a parameter function, we establish positive curvature in the entropic and (discrete) Bakry--\'{E}mery sense. In addition, we recall and give straightforward generalizations of some notions of coarse Ricci curvature, and we discuss some of their properties and relations with the concepts of couplings and coupling rates: as an application, we show exponential contraction of the $p$-Wasserstein distance for the heat flow in the aforementioned examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Liggett's condition can be relaxed without disrupting the convergence of open ASEP stationary measures to the open KPZ stationary measure. This is equivalent to demonstrating that, under weak asymmetry scaling and appropriate scaling of time and space, the four-parameter Askey-Wilson process converges to a two-parameter continuous dual Hahn process. We conjecture that the convergence of the open ASEP height function process to solutions to the open KPZ equation will hold for a wider range of ASEP parameters than those permitted by Liggett's condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inviscid Burgers equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}:=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ forced by the derivative of a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We construct global solutions with mean $\theta$ simultaneously for all $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, and in addition construct their associated global shocks (which are unique except on a countable set of $\theta$). We then show that as $\theta$ changes, the solution only changes through the movement of the global shock, and give precise formulas for this movement. This is an analogue of previous results by the author and Yu Gu in the viscous case with white-in-time forcing, which related the derivative of the solution in $\theta$ to the density of a particle diffusing in the Burgers flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of processes that contains many natural examples. The interesting feature of such type processes lays on its infinite memory that allows it to record a quite ancient history. Then, using the martingale decomposition method, we establish some deviation and moment inequalities for separately Lipschitz functions of such a process, under various moment conditions on some dominating random variables. Our results generalize the Markov models of Dedecker and Fan [Stochastic Process. Appl., 2015] and a recent paper by Chazottes et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab., 2023] for the special case of a specific class of infinite memory models with discrete values. An application to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamic algorithm is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Smooth Numbers for Harmonic Samples A Stein method Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a de Bruijn type approximation for quantifying the content of m smooth numbers, derived from samples obtained through a probability measure over the set of integers less than or equal to n, with point mass function at k inversely proportional to k. Our analysis is based on a stochastic representation of the measure of interest, utilizing weighted independent geometric random variables. This representation is analyzed through the lens of Stein method for the Dickman distribution. A pivotal element of our arguments relies on precise estimations concerning the regularity properties of the solution to the Dickman Stein equation for heaviside functions, recently developed by Bhattacharjee and Schulte. Remarkably, our arguments remain mostly in the realm of probability theory, with Mertens first and third theorems standing as the only number theory estimations required.</description>

      <title>Probability laws associated to the quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps -- the ultimate case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Sasada and Uozumi (2024) investigated connections between classical (deterministic) and random integrable models, discovering a hierarchy of quadrirational Yang-Baxter independence preserving (IP) maps together with related families of probability distributions. In view of the limiting properties of these IP maps, the newly defined generalized second kind beta ($\mathrm{GB}_{II}$) model stands at the top of the hierarchy: for independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ following a $\mathrm{GB}_{II}$ distribution, Sasada and Uozumi (2024) showed that when a special quadrirational Yang-Baxter map $F^{(\alpha,\beta)}$, parameterized by two distinct parameters $\alpha,\beta\in(0,\infty)$, is applied to the pair $(X,Y)$, it produces another pair $(U,V)$ of independent $\mathrm{GB}_{II}$-distributed random variables. Interestingly, the boundary cases of $\alpha\in\{0,\infty\}$ or $\beta\in\{0,\infty\}$ are related to one of the Matsumoto-Yor IP maps identified in Koudou and Vallois (2012).
  The aim of this paper is to show the uniqueness of this IP model. To this end, we introduce specially designed Laplace-type transforms. First, we carefully explain the connection between the results from Sasada and Uozumi (2024) and Koudou and Vallois (2012). Next, we focus on the characterization of second kind beta and the generalized second kind beta distributions through the IP map $F^{(\alpha,\infty)}$. Finally, extending considerably the methodology developed for the case $(\alpha,\infty)$, we prove the characterization of $\mathrm{GB}_{II}$ distributions in the case $(\alpha,\beta)\in(0,\infty)^2$ with $\alpha\neq\beta$, which implies uniqueness in the ultimate missing case of the quadrirational Yang-Baxter hierarchy of IP models.</description>

Abstract: The aim of these notes is to give a quick introduction to FK-percolation, focusing on certain recent results about the phase transition of the two dimensional model, namely its continuity or discontinuity depending on the cluster weight $q$, and the asymptotic rotational invariance of the critical phase (when the phase transition is continuous). As such, the main focus is on FK-percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ with $q \geq 1$, but we do mention some important results valid for general dimension. To favour quick access to recent results, the style is minimal, with certain proofs omitted or left as exercises.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of singular value spectrum of random matrices and two-point quantitative invertibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ random matrix with independent, identically distributed mean 0, variance 1 subgaussian entries. We prove that $$ \mathbb{P}(A\text{ has distinct singular values})\geq 1-e^{-cn} $$ for some $c&gt;0$, confirming a conjecture of Vu. This result is then generalized to singular values of rectangular random matrices with i.i.d. entries.
  We also prove that for two fixed real numbers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ with a sufficient lower bound on $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$, we have a joint singular value small ball estimate for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ $$ \mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A-\lambda_1I_n)\leq\epsilon n^{-1/2},\sigma_{min}(A-\lambda_2I_n)\leq\epsilon n^{-1/2})\leq C\epsilon^2+e^{-cn}, $$ where $\sigma_{min}(A)$ is the minimal singular value of a square matrix $A$ and $I_n$ is the identity matrix. For much smaller $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$ we derive a similar estimate with $C$ replaced by $C\sqrt{n}/|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|$. This generalizes the one-point estimate of Rudelson and Vershynin, which proves $\mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A)\leq \epsilon n^{-1/2})\leq C\epsilon+e^{-cn}$. Analogous two-point bounds are proven when $A$ has i.i.d. real and complex parts, with $\epsilon^4$ in place of $\epsilon^2$ on the right hand side of the estimate and for any complex numbers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$. These two point estimates can be used to derive strong anticoncentration bounds for an arbitrary linear combination of two eigenvalues of $A$.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Relation on Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.07166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is based on F. Burghart's master thesis at Stuttgart university from July 2018, supervised by Prof. Freiberg.
  We review the Einstein relation, which connects the Hausdorff, local walk and spectral dimensions on a space, in the abstract setting of a metric measure space equipped with a suitable operator. This requires some twists compared to the usual definitions from fractal geometry. The main result establishes the invariance of the three involved notions of fractal dimension under bi-Lipschitz continuous isomorphisms between mm-spaces and explains, more generally, how the transport of the analytic and stochastic structure behind the Einstein relation works. While any homeomorphism suffices for this transport of structure, non-Lipschitz maps distort the Hausdorff and the local walk dimension in different ways. To illustrate this, we take a look at H\"older regular transformations and how they influence the local walk dimension and describe the Einstein relation on graphs of fractional Brownian motions. We conclude by giving a short list of further questions that may help building a general theory of the Einstein relation.</description>

      <title>Moments of Colored Permutation Statistics on Conjugacy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the moments of statistics on conjugacy classes of the colored permutation groups $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}=\mathbb{Z}_r\wr \mathfrak{S}_n$. We first show that any fixed moment coincides on all conjugacy classes where all cycles have sufficiently long length. Additionally, for permutation statistics that can be realized via a process we call symmetric extensions, these moments are polynomials in $n$. Finally, for the descent statistic on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n\cong \mathfrak{S}_{n,2}$, we show that its distribution on conjugacy classes without short cycles satisfies a central limit theorem. Our results build on and generalize previous work of Fulman (\textit{J. Comb. Theory Ser. A.}, 1998), Hamaker and Rhoades (arXiv, 2022), and Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Stucky, Sundaram, and Yin (arXiv, 2023). In particular, our techniques utilize the combinatorial framework introduced by Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Stucky, Sundaram, and Yin.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any integer $n\geq 2$, we prove that for any large enough integer $d$, with large probability the injectivity radius of a random degree $d$ complex hypersurface in $\C P^n$ is larger than $d^{-\frac{1}2(3n+2)}$. Here the hypersurface is endowed with the restriction of the ambient Fubini-Study metric, and the probability measure is induced by the Fubini-Study $L^2$-Hermitian product on the space of homogeneous complex polynomials of degree $d$ in $(n+1)$-variables. We also prove that with high probability, the sectional curvatures of the random hypersurface are bounded by  $d^{\frac{3}2(n+2)}$,  and that its spectral gap is bounded below by $\exp(-d^{\frac{1}4(3n+15)})$. These results extend to random  submanifolds of higher codimension in any complex projective manifold. Independently, we prove that the diameter of a degree $d$ divisor is bounded by $Cd^3$, which generalizes and amends the bound given in~\cite{feng1999diameter} for planar curves.</description>

      <title>Estimation of on- and off-time distributions in a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph in which edges, according to an alternating renewal process, change from present to absent and vice versa. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Zeroth- and First-order Stochastic Trust-Region Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm's sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN's effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN's effect is pronounced -- ASTRO with CRN achieves $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ a.s. sample complexity compared to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN's effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

      <title>Detecting random bifurcations via rigorous enclosures of large deviations rate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Limiting eigenvalue distribution of the general deformed Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>On a class of high dimensional linear regression methods with debiasing and thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, inspired by classical regularization theory, for designing and analyzing a broad class of linear regression approaches. Our framework encompasses traditional methods like least squares regression and Ridge regression, as well as innovative techniques, including seven novel regression methods such as Landweber and Showalter regressions. Within this framework, we further propose a class of debiased and thresholded regression methods to promote feature selection, particularly in terms of sparsity. These methods may offer advantages over conventional regression techniques, including Lasso, due to their ease of computation via a closed-form expression. Theoretically, we establish consistency results and Gaussian approximation theorems for this new class of regularization methods. Extensive numerical simulations further demonstrate that the debiased and thresholded counterparts of linear regression methods exhibit favorable finite sample performance and may be preferable in certain settings.</description>
