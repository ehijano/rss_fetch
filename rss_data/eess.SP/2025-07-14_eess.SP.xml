      <title>LNN-powered Fluid Antenna Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems represent an innovative approach in wireless communication, recently applied in multiple access to optimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio through port selection. This letter frames the port selection problem as a multi-label classification task for the first time, improving best-port selection with limited port observations. We address this challenge by leveraging liquid neural networks (LNNs) to predict the optimal port under emerging fluid antenna multiple access scenarios alongside a more general $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading model. We also apply hyperparameter optimization to refine LNN architectures for different observation scenarios. Our approach yields lower outage probability values than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits via CRB of semi-blind channel estimation in Massive MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the deterministic and stochastic Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRB) for semi-blind channel estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We derive and analyze mathematically tractable expressions for both metrics under various asymptotic regimes, which govern the growth rates of the number of antennas, the number of users, the training sequence length, and the transmission block length. Unlike the existing work, our results show that the CRB can be made arbitrarily small as the transmission block length increases, but only when the training sequence length grows at the same rate and the number of users remains fixed. However, if the number of training sequences remains proportional to the number of users, the channel estimation error is always lower-bounded by a non-vanishing constant. Numerical results are presented to support our findings and demonstrate the advantages of semi-blind channel estimation in reducing the required number of training sequences.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation-Enabled Realistic Map-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is crucial for the improvement of signal processing performance in wireless communications. However, traditional model-based methods frequently experience difficulties in dynamic environments. Similarly, alternative machine-learning approaches typically lack generalization across different datasets due to variations in channel characteristics. To address this issue, in this study, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach to bridge the gap between the quasi-static channel model (QSCM) and the map-based channel model (MBCM). Specifically, we first proposed a channel estimation pipeline that takes into account realistic channel simulation to train our foundation model. Then, we proposed domain adaptation methods to address the estimation problem. Using simulation-based training to reduce data requirements for effective application in practical wireless environments, we find that the proposed strategy enables robust model performance, even with limited true channel information.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Overlapping Community Detection for Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been commonly used to construct functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of the human brain. TFCNs are primarily limited to quantifying pairwise relationships between ROIs ignoring higher order dependencies between multiple brain regions. Recently, hypergraph construction methods from fMRI time series data have been proposed to characterize the high-order relations among multiple ROIs. While there have been multiple methods for constructing hypergraphs from fMRI time series, the question of how to characterize the topology of these hypergraphs remains open. In this paper, we make two key contributions to the field of community detection in brain hypernetworks. First, we construct a hypergraph for each subject capturing high order dependencies between regions. Second, we introduce a spectral clustering based approach on hypergraphs to detect overlapping community structure. Finally, the proposed method is implemented to detect the consensus community structure across multiple subjects. The proposed method is applied to resting state fMRI data from Human Connectome Project to summarize the overlapping community structure across a group of healthy young adults.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Offset Estimation for Clock-Asynchronous Bistatic ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is poised to become a key application for next generation communication networks (e.g., B5G/6G), providing simultaneous sensing and communication services with minimal changes to existing network infrastructure and hardware. However, a significant challenge in bistatic cooperative sensing is clock asynchronism, arising from the use of different clocks at far separated transmitters and receivers. This asynchrony leads to Timing Offsets (TOs) and Carrier Frequency Offsets (CFOs), potentially causing sensing ambiguity. Traditional synchronization methods typically rely on static reference links or GNSS-based timing sources, both of which are often unreliable or unavailable in UAVbased bistatic ISAC scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Time-Varying Offset Estimation (TVOE) framework tailored for clock-asynchronous bistatic ISAC systems, which leverages the geometrically predictable characteristics of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path to enable robust, infrastructure-free
  synchronization. The framework treats the LoS delay and the Doppler shift as dynamic observations and models their evolution as a hidden stochastic process. A state-space formulation is developed to jointly estimate TO and CFO via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), enabling real-time tracking of clock offsets across successive frames. Furthermore, the estimated offsets are subsequently applied to correct the timing misalignment of all Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) components, thereby enhancing the high-resolution target sensing performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TVOE method improves the estimation accuracy by 60%.</description>

      <title>Image Super-Resolution-Based Signal Enhancement in Bistatic ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is poised to become a cornerstone technology in next-generation communication networks, such as Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G, by enabling the concurrent execution of sensing and communication functions without requiring significant modifications to existing infrastructure. Despite its promising potential, a major challenge in bistatic cooperative sensing lies in the degradation of sensing accuracy, primarily caused by the inherently weak received signals resulting from high reflection losses in complex environments. Traditional methods have predominantly relied on adaptive filtering techniques to enhance the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by dynamically adjusting the filter coefficients. However, these methods often struggle to adapt effectively to the increasingly complex and diverse network topologies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Image Super-Resolution-based Signal Enhancement (ISR-SE) framework that significantly improves the recognition and recovery capabilities of ISAC signals. Specifically, we first perform a time-frequency analysis by applying the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to the received signals, generating spectrograms that capture the frequency, magnitude, and phase components. These components are then mapped into RGB images, where each channel represents one of the extracted features, enabling a more intuitive and informative visualization of the signal structure. To enhance these RGB images, we design an improved denoising network that combines the strengths of the UNet architecture and diffusion models. This hybrid architecture leverages UNet's multi-scale feature extraction and the generative capacity of diffusion models to perform effective image denoising, thereby improving the quality and clarity of signal representations under low-SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for sub-THz Radio Unit Selection using sub-10 GHz Channel Information and Inferred Device Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense and distributed deployment of sub-THz radio units (RUs) alongside sub-10 GHz access point (AP) is a promising approach to provide high data rate and reliable coverage for future 6G applications. However, beam search or RU selection for the sub-THz RUs incurs significant overhead and high power consumption. To address this, we introduce a method that leverages deep learning to infer a suitable sub-THz RU candidate from a set of sub-THz RUs using the sub-10 GHz channel characteristics. A novel aspect of this work is the consideration of inter-band beam configuration (IBBC), defined as the broadside angle between the low-band and high-band antenna patterns of the user equipment (UE). Since IBBC indicates the beamforming information or UE's orientation, it is typically not shared with the network as a part of signalling. Therefore, we propose a solution strategy to infer a suitable sub-THz RU even when UEs do not share their IBBC information. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the inferred sub-THz RU and highlights the detrimental impact of neglecting UE orientation on the systems performance.</description>

      <title>Matched Filtering-Based Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has recently emerged as an excellent backward-compatible 6G waveform. In this paper, an enhanced AFDM is proposed whereby the delay-Doppler (DD) coupling phase is considered. Specifically, we study matched filtering (MF) assisted channel estimation (CE) for AFDM systems in complex doubly selective channels. By deriving the complete input-output relationship, the inter-chirp-carrier interference, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the effective SINR loss of AFDM, are investigated in discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain. Further, we look into the path ambiguity problem and show that it may lead to severe performance deterioration in fractional-delay fractional-Doppler channels. To address such a problem, we introduce an MF assisted CE scheme building upon a novel pilot arrangement across two consecutive AFDM transmissions. This allows us to sequentially estimate the parameters of each path by exploiting the separability and approximate orthogonality of different paths in the DAFT domain, thus leading to significantly reduced complexity. Furthermore, based on generalized Fibonacci search (GFS), an MF-GFS scheme is proposed to avoid significantly redundant computation, which can be extended to typical wide-band systems. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes offer superior advantages in terms of their improved communication performance and lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Free-running vs. Synchronous: Single-Photon Lidar for High-flux 3D Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that single-photon lidar (SPL) should operate in low-light conditions to minimize dead-time effects. Many methods have been developed to mitigate these effects in synchronous SPL systems. However, solutions for free-running SPL remain limited despite the advantage of reduced histogram distortion from dead times. To improve the accuracy of free-running SPL, we propose a computationally efficient joint maximum likelihood estimator of the signal flux, the background flux, and the depth using only histograms, along with a complementary regularization framework that incorporates a learned point cloud score model as a prior. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that free-running SPL yields lower estimation errors than its synchronous counterpart under identical conditions, with our regularization further improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Enregy Efficient Design of Hybrid NOMA Based on Hybrid SIC with Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) technology, which effectively utilizes both NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technologies through flexible resource allocation in a single transmission, has demonstrated immense potential for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper proposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive interference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA transmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is rigorously derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the probability of the proposed H-NOMA scheme approaches 1 in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime without any constraints on either users' target rates or transmit power ratios. This represents a significant improvement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific restrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in existing work. The above observation indicates that with less energy consumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy efficiency. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and also demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed H-NOMA scheme.</description>

      <title>Reframing SAR Target Recognition as Visual Reasoning: A Chain-of-Thought Dataset with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image recognition, traditional methods often struggle with the intrinsic limitations of SAR data, such as weak texture, high noise, and ambiguous object boundaries. This work explores a novel perspective by reformulating SAR target recognition as a multimodal reasoning task. We leverage multimodal large language models (MLLMs), specifically GPT-4o, to perform target classification based on SAR imagery, guided by candidate categories and enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. A new dataset is constructed based on the FAIR-CSAR benchmark, comprising raw SAR images, structured target annotations, candidate label sets, and GPT-generated CoT reasoning chains. Experimental results show that the MLLMs are capable of generating logically coherent and interpretable inferences in most scenarios. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and current limitations of MLLMs in interpreting SAR imagery, and we provide detailed insights into model behavior through failure case analysis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating MLLMs into SAR analysis pipelines and establishes a foundation for future research in SAR-oriented visual reasoning.</description>

      <title>Novel Physics-Aware Attention-Based Machine Learning Approach for Mutual Coupling Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a physics-aware convolutional long short-term memory (PC-LSTM) network for efficient and accurate extraction of mutual impedance matrices in dipole antenna arrays. By reinterpreting the Green's function through a physics-aware neural network and embedding it into an adaptive loss function, the proposed machine learning-based approach achieves enhanced physical interpretability in mutual coupling modeling. Also, an attention mechanism is carefully designed to calibrate complex-valued features by fusing the real and imaginary parts of the Green's function matrix. These fused representations are then processed by a convolutional long short-term memory network, and the impedance matrix of the linear antenna array can be finally derived. Validation against five benchmarks underscores the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating accurate impedance extraction with up to a 7x speedup compared to CST Microwave Studio, making it a fast alternative to full-wave simulations for mutual coupling characterization.</description>

      <title>A New Wireless Image Transmission System Using Code Index Modulation and Image Enhancement for High-Rate Next Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of wireless network technologies, the wireless image transmission area has become prominent. The need for high resolution, data traffic density, widespread use of multimedia applications, and the importance of high rate and reliable image transmission in medical and military fields necessitate the design of novel and high-performance wireless image transmission systems. This paper proposes a code index modulation (CIM)-based image transmission (CIM-IT) system that utilizes spreading code index and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol for image transmission over a wireless channel. The proposed CIM-IT system maps bits to each pixel value of the image to be transmitted and transmits these bits over a wireless channel using a single-input and multiple-output system comprising code index modulation and QAM techniques. At the receiver, the active spreading code index and the selected QAM symbol are estimated using a despreading-based maximum likelihood detector, and the corresponding bits are obtained. The image conveyed from the transmitter is then reconstructed at the receiver side using the pixel values corresponding to the bits. The obtained noisy image is enhanced using important enhancement filters. In addition, an advanced filter is proposed to improve the transmitted degraded image with optimum results. Furthermore, error performance, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and throughputof the CIM-IT system are performed and the results are compared with traditional wireless communication techniques.</description>

      <title>Compute SNR-Optimal Analog-to-Digital Converters for Analog In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is an energy-efficient alternative to digital architectures for accelerating machine learning and signal processing workloads. However, its energy efficiency is limited by the high energy cost of the column analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Reducing the ADC precision is an effective approach to lowering its energy cost. However, doing so also reduces the AIMC's computational accuracy thereby making it critical to identify the minimum precision required to meet a target accuracy. Prior works overestimate the ADC precision requirements by modeling quantization error as input-independent noise, maximizing the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR), and ignoring the discrete nature of ideal pre-ADC signal. We address these limitations by developing analytical expressions for estimating the compute signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), a true metric of accuracy for AIMCs, and propose CACTUS, an algorithm to obtain CSNR-optimal ADC parameters. Using a circuit-aware behavioral model of an SRAM-based AIMC in a 28nm CMOS process, we show that for a 256-dimensional binary dot product, CACTUS reduces the ADC precision requirements by 3b while achieving 6dB higher CSNR over prior methods. We also delineate operating conditions under which our proposed CSNR-optimal ADCs outperform conventional SQNR-optimal ADCs.</description>

      <title>Precoded Zak-OTFS for Per-Carrier Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the scattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding at the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years ago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution where a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional partial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS modulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by twisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this channel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD carrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all carriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD carriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating data and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Wide-Area Data Imaging via Massive Non-Orthogonal Direct Device-to-HAPS Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Aerial Processing for X MAP-X is an innovative framework for reconstructing spatially correlated ground data, such as environmental or industrial measurements distributed across a wide area, into data maps using a single high altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) and a large number of distributed sensors. With subframe-level data reconstruction, MAP-X provides a transformative solution for latency-sensitive IoT applications. This article explores two distinct approaches for AI integration in the post-processing stage of MAP-X. The DNN-based pointwise estimation approach enables real-time, adaptive reconstruction through online training, while the CNN-based image reconstruction approach improves reconstruction accuracy through offline training with non-real-time data. Simulation results show that both approaches significantly outperform the conventional inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)-based linear post-processing method. Furthermore, to enable AI-enhanced MAP-X, we propose a ground-HAPS cooperation framework, where terrestrial stations collect, process, and relay training data to the HAPS. With its enhanced capability in reconstructing field data, AI-enhanced MAP-X is applicable to various real-world use cases, including disaster response and network management.</description>

      <title>VoxelRF: Voxelized Radiance Field for Fast Wireless Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless channel modeling in complex environments is crucial for wireless communication system design and deployment. Traditional channel modeling approaches face challenges in balancing accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, while recent neural approaches such as neural radiance field (NeRF) suffer from long training and slow inference. To tackle these challenges, we propose voxelized radiance field (VoxelRF), a novel neural representation for wireless channel modeling that enables fast and accurate synthesis of spatial spectra. VoxelRF replaces the costly multilayer perception (MLP) used in NeRF-based methods with trilinear interpolation of voxel grid-based representation, and two shallow MLPs to model both propagation and transmitter-dependent effects. To further accelerate training and improve generalization, we introduce progressive learning, empty space skipping, and an additional background entropy loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that VoxelRF achieves competitive accuracy with significantly reduced computation and limited training data, making it more practical for real-time and resource-constrained wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Aware Extended Kalman Filter for Tracking Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad range of applications involve signals with irregular structures that can be represented as a graph. As the underlying structures can change over time, the tracking dynamic graph topologies from observed signals is a fundamental challenge in graph signal processing (GSP), with applications in various domains, such as power systems, the brain-machine interface, and communication systems. In this paper, we propose a method for tracking dynamic changes in graph topologies. Our approach builds on a representation of the dynamics as a graph-based nonlinear state-space model (SSM), where the observations are graph signals generated through graph filtering, and the underlying evolving topology serves as the latent states. In our formulation, the graph Laplacian matrix is parameterized using the incidence matrix and edge weights, enabling a structured representation of the state. In order to track the evolving topology in the resulting SSM, we develop a sparsity-aware extended Kalman filter (EKF) that integrates $\ell_1$-regularized updates within the filtering process. Furthermore, a dynamic programming scheme to efficiently compute the Jacobian of the graph filter is introduced. Our numerical study demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to accurately track sparse and time-varying graphs under realistic conditions, with highly nonlinear measurements, various noise levels, and different change rates, while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Beamforming Design Using Target Beam Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning-based beamforming design framework that directly maps a target beam pattern to optimal beamforming vectors across multiple antenna array architectures, including digital, analog, and hybrid beamforming. The proposed method employs a lightweight encoder-decoder network where the encoder compresses the complex beam pattern into a low-dimensional feature vector and the decoder reconstructs the beamforming vector while satisfying hardware constraints. To address training challenges under diverse and limited channel station information (CSI) conditions, a two-stage training process is introduced, which consists of an offline pre-training for robust feature extraction using an auxiliary module, followed by online training of the decoder with a composite loss function that ensures alignment between the synthesized and target beam patterns in terms of the main lobe shape and side lobe suppression. Simulation results based on NYUSIM-generated channels show that the proposed method can achieve spectral efficiency close to that of fully digital beamforming under limited CSI and outperforms representative existing methods.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic frequency distribution characterises neural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing multivariate time series with certain basic dynamics is crucial for understanding, predicting and controlling nonlinear spatiotemporally dynamic systems such as the brain. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method for decomposing nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics into several basic dynamics (dynamic modes; DMs) with intrinsic frequencies and decay rates. In particular, unlike Fourier transform-based methods, which are used to decompose a single-channel signal into the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves with discrete frequencies at a regular interval, DMD can derive the intrinsic frequencies of a multichannel signal on the basis of the available data; furthermore, it can capture nonstationary components such as alternations between states with different intrinsic frequencies. Here, we propose the use of the distribution of intrinsic frequencies derived from DMDs (DM frequencies) to characterise neural activities. The distributions of DM frequencies in the electroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or Parkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated. By using the distributions, these patients were distinguished from healthy subjects with significantly greater accuracy than when using amplitude spectra derived by discrete Fourier transform. This finding suggests that the distribution of DM frequencies exhibits distinct behaviour from amplitude spectra, and therefore, the distribution may serve as a new biomarker by characterising the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological signals.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems for Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the potential of pinching-antenna systems for enhancing physical layer security. By pre-installing multiple pinching antennas at discrete positions along a waveguide, the capability of the considered system to perform amplitude and phase adjustment is validated through the formulation of a secrecy rate maximization problem. Specifically, amplitude control is applied to enhance the signal quality at the legitimate user, while phase alignment is designed to degrade the received signal quality at the eavesdropper. This cooperation among pinching antennas is modeled as a coalitional game, and a corresponding antenna activation algorithm is proposed. The individual impact of each antenna is quantified based on the Shapley value and marginal contribution, providing a fair and efficient method for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that the considered pinching-antenna system achieves significant improvements in secrecy rate, and that the Shapley value based algorithm outperforms conventional coalition value based solutions.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems with LoS Blockages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this letter is to explore the capability of pinching-antenna systems to construct line-of-sight (LoS) links in the presence of LoS blockages. Specifically, pinching antennas are pre-installed at preconfigured positions along waveguides and can be selectively activated to create LoS links for enhancing desired signals and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links for eliminating inter-user interference. On this basis, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing waveguide assignment and antenna activation. To solve this problem, a matching based algorithm is proposed using two distinct preference designs. Simulation results demonstrate that the considered pinching-antenna system and proposed solutions can dynamically establish LoS links and effectively exploit LoS blockages to mitigate interference, thereby significantly improving system throughput.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Throughput and Seamless Handover Solutions for Urban 5G-Vehicle C-Band Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates downlink transmission in 5G Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks (ISTNs) supporting automotive users (UEs) in urban environments, where base stations (BSs) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (LSats) cooperate to serve moving UEs over shared C-band frequency carriers. Urban settings, characterized by dense obstructions, together with UE mobility, and the dynamic movement and coverage of LSats pose significant challenges to user association and resource allocation. To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem designed to improve both throughput and seamless handover (HO). Particularly, the formulated problem balances sum-rate (SR) maximization and connection change (CC) minimization through a weighted trade-off by jointly optimizing power allocation and BS-UE/LSat-UE associations over a given time window. This is a mixed-integer and non-convex problem which is inherently difficult to solve. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) technique. Furthermore, we introduce a practical prediction-based algorithm capable of providing efficient solutions in real-world implementations. Especially, the simulations use a realistic 3D map of London and UE routes obtained from the Google Navigator application to ensure practical examination. Thanks to these realistic data, the simulation results can show valuable insights into the link budget assessment in urban areas due to the impact of buildings on transmission links under the blockage, reflection, and diffraction effects. Furthermore, the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in terms of SR and the CC-number compared to the greedy and benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>CovertAuth: Joint Covert Communication and Authentication in MmWave Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam alignment (BA) is a crucial process in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, enabling precise directional transmission and efficient link establishment. However, due to characteristics like omnidirectional exposure and the broadcast nature of the BA phase, it is particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping and identity impersonation attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel secure framework named CovertAuth, designed to enhance the security of the BA phase against such attacks. In particular, to combat eavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability and covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication problem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power is formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness requirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive convex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To combat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array impairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy detector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical models for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities are also provided to conduct performance analysis. Based on these models, an optimization problem is constructed to determine the optimal weight value that maximizes authentication accuracy. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that CovertAuth presents improved detection accuracy under the same covertness requirement compared to existing works.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the low-rank decomposition problem, such as principal and independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) for continuous-time vector-valued signals and provide a model-agnostic implicit neural signal representation framework to learn numerical approximations to solve the problem. Modeling signals as continuous-time stochastic processes, we unify the approaches to both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where standard techniques are not applicable.</description>

      <title>Transformer based Collaborative Reinforcement Learning for Fluid Antenna System (FAS)-enabled 3D UAV Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel Three dimensional (3D) positioning framework of fluid antenna system (FAS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is developed. In the proposed framework, a set of controlled UAVs cooperatively estimate the real-time 3D position of a target UAV. Here, the active UAV transmits a measurement signal to the passive UAVs via the reflection from the target UAV. Each passive UAV estimates the distance of the active-target-passive UAV link and selects an antenna port to share the distance information with the base station (BS) that calculates the real-time position of the target UAV. As the target UAV is moving due to its task operation, the controlled UAVs must optimize their trajectories and select optimal antenna port, aiming to estimate the real-time position of the target UAV. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem to minimize the target UAV positioning error via optimizing the trajectories of all controlled UAVs and antenna port selection of passive UAVs. Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement learning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use the local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while optimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the trajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different from current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV, and an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical state-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy and the target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed AR-MARL scheme can reduce the average positioning error by up to 17.5% and 58.5% compared to the VD-MARL scheme and the proposed method without FAS.</description>

      <title>Reliable Task Offloading in MEC through Transmission Diversity and Jamming-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) enables low-latency applications by bringing computation closer to the user, but dynamic task arrivals and communication threats like jamming complicate reliable task offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we formulate a dynamic MEC framework considering the transmission diversity that jointly addresses task scheduling and resource block (RB) assignment in the presence of jamming. First, we define and evaluate key network metrics-including dropped task ratio and bandwidth utilization-while maintaining service continuity by accounting for the existing commitments of the edge server to previously offloaded tasks. Then, we propose a jamming-aware offloading and RB allocation framework that leverages transmission diversity and optimal scheduling across distributed gNBs. The proposed solution is compared to a similar scenario without transmission diversity and two baseline strategies of first-come-first-served (FCFS) and shortest task first (STF). The proposed algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of jamming while enhancing resource utilization and minimizing task drop rates, making it highly suitable for mission-critical MEC applications. At signal-to-jamming-and-noise ratio (SJNR) of 4 dB, the proposed method achieves a $0.26$ task drop rate, outperforming the scenario without transmission diversity with a task drop rate of 0.50 and STF and FCFS strategies with 0.52 and 0.63 task drop rates, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Access Point Activation and Power Allocation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are investigated where distributed access points jointly serve users and sensing targets. We demonstrate that only a subset of access points (APs) has to be activated for both tasks, while deactivating redundant APs is essential for power savings. This motivates joint active AP selection and power control for optimizing energy efficiency. The resultant problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To address this, we propose a model-based Branch-and-Bound approach as a strong baseline to guide a semi-supervised heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) for selecting the best active APs and the power allocation. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HetGNN reduces power consumption by 20-25\% and runs nearly 10,000 times faster than model-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Introducing Meta-Fiber into Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for MIMO Communications: A Low-Complexity Design with only Two Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), which integrate multiple programmable metasurface layers, have recently emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing. SIMs benefit from flexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM designs face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy attenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose incorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of layers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a meta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal processing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains the operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization problem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and the desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of the meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a non-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase shift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional multi-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are analyzed to provide design insights. Finally, numerical results are illustrated, demonstrating that the proposed two-layer SIM with meta-fiber achieves over a 25% improvement in channel capacity while reducing the total number of meta-atoms by 59% as compared with a conventional seven-layer SIM.</description>

Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Learning: Algorithms and Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is often represented through the relationships between data samples, forming a graph structure. In many applications, it is necessary to learn this graph structure from the observed data. Current graph learning research has primarily focused on unsigned graphs, which consist only of positive edges. However, many biological and social systems are better described by signed graphs that account for both positive and negative interactions, capturing similarity and dissimilarity between samples. In this paper, we develop a method for learning signed graphs from a set of smooth signed graph signals. Specifically, we employ the net Laplacian as a graph shift operator (GSO) to define smooth signed graph signals as the outputs of a low-pass signed graph filter defined by the net Laplacian. The signed graph is then learned by formulating a non-convex optimization problem where the total variation of the observed signals is minimized with respect to the net Laplacian. The proposed problem is solved using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and a fast algorithm reducing the per-ADMM iteration complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of nodes is introduced. Furthermore, theoretical proofs of convergence for the algorithm and a bound on the estimation error of the learned net Laplacian as a function of sample size, number of nodes, and graph topology are provided. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on simulated data and gene regulatory network inference problem and compared to existing signed graph learning methods.</description>

      <title>TolerantECG: A Foundation Model for Imperfect Electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</description>

      <title>Learning-Aided Iterative Receiver for Superimposed Pilots: Design and Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superimposed pilot transmission scheme offers substantial potential for improving spectral efficiency in MIMO-OFDM systems, but it presents significant challenges for receiver design due to pilot contamination and data interference. To address these issues, we propose an advanced iterative receiver based on joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding, which refines the receiver outputs through iterative feedback. The proposed receiver incorporates two adaptive channel estimation strategies to enhance robustness under time-varying and mismatched channel conditions. First, a variational message passing (VMP) method and its low-complexity variant (VMP-L) are introduced to perform inference without relying on time-domain correlation. Second, a deep learning (DL) based estimator is developed, featuring a convolutional neural network with a despreading module and an attention mechanism to extract and fuse relevant channel features. Extensive simulations under multi-stream and high-mobility scenarios demonstrate that the proposed receiver consistently outperforms conventional orthogonal pilot baselines in both throughput and block error rate. Moreover, over-the-air experiments validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed design. Among the methods, the DL based estimator achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity, highlighting its suitability for real-world deployment in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improved Differential Evolution for Enhancing the Aggregated Channel Estimation of RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-Free Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are investigated with the support of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The RIS phase shifts are designed for improved channel estimation in the presence of spatial correlation. Specifically, we formulate the channel estimate and estimation error expressions using linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation for the aggregated channels. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the average normalized mean square error (NMSE) subject to practical phase shift constraints. To circumvent the problem of inherent nonconvexity, we then conceive an enhanced version of the differential evolution algorithm that is capable of avoiding local minima by introducing an augmentation operator applied to some high-performing Diffential Evolution (DE) individuals. Numerical results indicate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the channel estimation quality of the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Multichannel Wiener Filter for Acoustic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic beamforming models typically assume wide-sense stationarity of speech signals within short time frames. However, voiced speech is better modeled as a cyclostationary (CS) process, a random process whose mean and autocorrelation are $T_1$-periodic, where $\alpha_1=1/T_1$ corresponds to the fundamental frequency of vowels. Higher harmonic frequencies are found at integer multiples of the fundamental. This work introduces a cyclic multichannel Wiener filter (cMWF) for speech enhancement derived from a cyclostationary model. This beamformer exploits spectral correlation across the harmonic frequencies of the signal to further reduce the mean-squared error (MSE) between the target and the processed input. The proposed cMWF is optimal in the MSE sense and reduces to the MWF when the target is wide-sense stationary. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate considerable improvements in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) on synthetic data but also indicate high sensitivity to the accuracy of the estimated fundamental frequency $\alpha_1$, which limits effectiveness on real data.</description>

      <title>Harmonics to the Rescue: Why Voiced Speech is Not a Wss Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech processing algorithms often rely on statistical knowledge of the underlying process. Despite many years of research, however, the debate on the most appropriate statistical model for speech still continues. Speech is commonly modeled as a wide-sense stationary (WSS) process. However, the use of the WSS model for spectrally correlated processes is fundamentally wrong, as WSS implies spectral uncorrelation. In this paper, we demonstrate that voiced speech can be more accurately represented as a cyclostationary (CS) process. By employing the CS rather than the WSS model for processes that are inherently correlated across frequency, it is possible to improve the estimation of cross-power spectral densities (PSDs), source separation, and beamforming. We illustrate how the correlation between harmonic frequencies of CS processes can enhance system identification, and validate our findings using both simulated and real speech data.</description>

Abstract: The Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS) and Low-Power Synchronization Signal (LP-SS), introduced in 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 19, represent a major step forward in enabling power-efficient IoT communications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the LP-WUS and LP-SS procedures in the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states, and outlines key physical layer design choices. The LP-WUS is designed to be detected by a low-power energy detector (ED), allowing the main radio (MR) to remain switched off. This architecture enables power savings of up to 80% compared to conventional 5G paging mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Agnostic Federated Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known \emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hemodynamic Parameter Estimations: Nonlinear Blood Behavior in 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hemodynamic parameters are often estimated assuming a constant Newtonian viscosity, even though blood exhibits shear-thinning behavior. This article investigates the influence of blood rheology and hematocrit (Hct) percentage on the estimation of Wall Shear Stress (WSS), rate of viscous Energy Loss ($\dot{E}_L$) at different points in the cardiac cycle, and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI). We focus on a hematocrit-dependent power-law non-Newtonian model, considering a wide range of Hct values at physiological temperature, with rheological parameters obtained from previously reported experimental data. In all cases, we systematically compared WSS, $\dot{E}_L$, and OSI using both Newtonian and power-law models, underscoring the crucial role of blood rheology in accurately assessing cardiovascular diseases. Our results show that, in in-silico experiments, differences in WSS and $\dot{E}_L$ across a wide range of Hct values can reach as high as 190\% and 113\% at systole, and as low as -72\% and -74\% at diastole, respectively. In in-vivo data, differences in WSS and $\dot{E}_L$ can reach up to -45\% and -60\% at systole, and range from -69\% to 73\% at diastole. This study enhances our understanding of the impact of blood rheology on hemodynamic parameter estimations using both in-silico and in-vivo aortic 4D Flow MRI data.</description>

Abstract: Infrared thermography, which has widely spread particularly during the COVID-19 period, has been effectively used for research on health monitoring and emotion estimation. Nevertheless, detecting minute temperature changes with thermography is challenging as it is disturbed by not only noise but also outside temperature surrounding the object. In this study, we demonstrate detecting face temperature variation by implementing lock-in thermography using heartbeat signals as a reference. It allows us to detect minute temperature changes, as low as $\sim$10 mK, on the forehead with a commercially available thermal camera. The proposed approach enables stable measurement of body temperature variation, showing potential for non-contact emotion estimation.</description>

      <title>HiFAKES: Synthetic High-Frequency NILM Data for NILM Models Diagnostics and Generalization Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring electricity consumption at the appliance level is crucial for increasing energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings. Using a single meter, the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) breaks down household consumption down to appliance-level, providing comprehensive insights into end-user electricity behavior. NILM models are trained on a household's total power consumption paired with submetered appliance labels. When sampled at high frequencies ($\geq$ 1 kHz), these datasets capture the full waveform characteristics, significantly improving disaggregation accuracy and model generalization. Nevertheless, such datasets are scarce, collected from a limited number of households, and rarely include labels for power estimation, which complicates their use for model training, evaluation, or debugging. We propose HiFAKES, a pre-trained synthetic data generator that can instantly generate unlimited amounts of fully labeled high-frequency NILM data, including aggregated and submetered current signatures. The data is ready-to-use and annotated for load identification (classification) and power estimation (regression). It allows simulating seen and completely unseen scenarios of appliances' behavior with full control over the number of appliance classes, operational modes, class similarity, brand diversity, and the number of concurrently running devices. We propose a structured methodology to test the generalization of NILM models on simulated unseen households. The reliability of the HiFAKES synthetic data is assessed using a domain-agnostic 3-dimensional metric. The generated signatures achieve high realism (93\% authenticity), closely resemble real-world data (84\% fidelity), and include a reasonable portion of unseen signatures (5\%).</description>

      <title>A Framework for Fractional Matrix Programming Problems with Applications in FBL MU-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient framework is conceived for fractional matrix programming (FMP) optimization problems (OPs) namely for minimization and maximization. In each generic OP, either the objective or the constraints are functions of multiple arbitrary continuous-domain fractional functions (FFs). This ensures the framework's versatility, enabling it to solve a broader range of OPs than classical FMP solvers, like Dinkelbach-based algorithms. Specifically, the generalized Dinkelbach algorithm can only solve multiple-ratio FMP problems. By contrast, our framework solves OPs associated with a sum or product of multiple FFs as the objective or constraint functions. Additionally, our framework provides a single-loop solution, while most FMP solvers require twin-loop algorithms.
  Many popular performance metrics of wireless communications are FFs. For instance, latency has a fractional structure, and minimizing the sum delay leads to an FMP problem. Moreover, the mean square error (MSE) and energy efficiency (EE) metrics have fractional structures. Thus, optimizing EE-related metrics such as the sum or geometric mean of EEs and enhancing the metrics related to spectral-versus-energy-efficiency tradeoff yield FMP problems. Furthermore, both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the channel dispersion are FFs. In this paper, we also develop resource allocation schemes for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, using finite block length (FBL) coding, demonstrating attractive practical applications of FMP by optimizing the aforementioned metrics.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review of Deep Unfolding Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in wireless communications has been extensively explored, with deep unfolding emerging as a powerful model-based technique. Deep unfolding enhances interpretability by transforming complex iterative algorithms into structured layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach seamlessly integrates domain knowledge with deep learning (DL), leveraging the strengths of both methods to simplify complex signal processing tasks in communication systems. To provide a solid foundation, we first present a brief overview of DL and deep unfolding. We then explore the applications of deep unfolding in key areas, including signal detection, channel estimation, beamforming design, decoding for error-correcting codes, sensing and communication, power allocation, and security. Each section focuses on a specific task, highlighting its significance in emerging 6G technologies and reviewing recent advancements in deep unfolding-based solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing deep unfolding techniques and propose potential improvements to enhance their applicability across diverse wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advances in Anti-Deception Jamming Strategies for Radar Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deception jamming has long been a significant threat to radar systems, interfering with search, acquisition, and tracking by introducing false information that diverts attention from the targets of interest. As deception strategies become more sophisticated, the vulnerability of radar systems to these attacks continues to escalate. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the evolution of anti-deception jamming techniques, starting with legacy solutions and progressing to the latest advancements. Current research is categorized into three key areas: prevention strategies, which hinder the ability of jammers to alter radar processing; detection strategies, which alert the system to deception and may classify the type of attack; and mitigation strategies, which aim to reduce or suppress the impact of jamming. Additionally, key avenues for further research are highlighted, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cognitive, and AI-enabled radar systems. We envision this paper as a gateway to the existing literature on anti-deception jamming, a critical area for safeguarding radar systems against evolving threats.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Remote Tracking Through Correlated Observations in Pull-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are correlated, meaning that each sensor sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communication or proximity-based monitoring. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over age-based and deep-Q network baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</description>

      <title>Embracing Diffraction: A Paradigm Shift in Wireless Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless signals are integral to modern society, enabling both communication and increasingly, environmental sensing. While various propagation models exist, ranging from empirical methods to full-wave simulations, the phenomenon of electromagnetic diffraction is often treated as a secondary effect or a correction factor. This paper positions diffraction as a fundamentally important and underutilized mechanism that is rich with information about the physical environment. Specifically, diffraction-inducing elements generate distinct signatures that are rich with information about their underlying properties such as their geometries. We then argue that by understanding and exploiting these relationships, diffraction can be harnessed strategically. We introduce a general optimization framework to formalize this concept, illustrating how diffraction can be leveraged for both inverse problems (sensing scene details such as object geometries from measured fields) and design problems (shaping radio frequency (RF) fields for communication objectives by configuring diffracting elements). Focusing primarily on edge diffraction and Keller's Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), we discuss specific applications in RF sensing for scene understanding and in communications for RF field programming, drawing upon recent work. Overall, this paper lays out a vision for systematically incorporating diffraction into the design and operation of future wireless systems, paving the way for enhanced sensing capabilities and more robust communication strategies.</description>

      <title>GPS-Aided Deep Learning for Beam Prediction and Tracking in UAV mmWave Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications, maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3 beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.</description>

      <title>Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Approaching Rate-Distortion Limits in Neural Compression with Lattice Transform Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural compression has brought tremendous progress in designing lossy compressors with good rate-distortion (RD) performance at low complexity. Thus far, neural compression design involves transforming the source to a latent vector, which is then rounded to integers and entropy coded. While this approach has been shown to be optimal on a few specific sources, we show that it can be highly sub-optimal on synthetic sources whose intrinsic dimensionality is greater than one. With integer rounding in the latent space, the quantization regions induced by neural transformations, remain square-like and fail to match those of optimal vector quantization. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the choice of scalar quantization in the latent space, and not the transform design. By employing lattice quantization instead, we propose Lattice Transform Coding (LTC) and show that it approximately recovers optimal vector quantization at reasonable complexity. On real-world sources, LTC improves upon standard neural compressors. LTC also provides a framework that can integrate structurally (near) optimal information-theoretic designs into lossy compression; examples include block coding, which yields coding gain over optimal one-shot coding and approaches the asymptotically-achievable rate-distortion function, as well as nested lattice quantization for low complexity fixed-rate coding.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Correlated Phase-Noise Channels: An Electro-Optic Frequency Comb Example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity of a discrete-time channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each subchannel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$, where $M$ represents the number of subchannels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of subchannels $M$. For the specific case of $M=2$, capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$. This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of $\mathbf{x}^{\sharp}$. First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le Cs^{-1/2}\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ holds for all $\mathbf{x}$ in the unit Euclidean sphere, where $\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ is the $\ell_1$ distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to its closest $s$-sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small $\tau_0$, appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\tau_0)$. This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary $\zeta_0$-fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\sqrt{\zeta_0\log(1/\zeta_0)})$. The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Multiuser Scheduling in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Hybrid Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF) metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms, followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the specific criteria within a given scenario.</description>
