      <title>Athermal creep deformation of ultrastable amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Simulating Curved Lipid Membranes Using Anchored Frozen Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid bilayers often form high-curvature configurations due to self-assembly conditions or certain biological processes. However, particle-based simulations of lipid membranes are predominantly of flat lipid membranes because planar membranes are easily connected over periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a curved lipid membrane, one can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a bicelle (disk-like bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to control curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic potentials, or ``tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations due to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an alternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved lipid membrane with ``frozen'' equilibrated membrane patches. The method presented here is compatible with all particle-based lipid models and easily extended to many geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with DPPC, DOPC, DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3 coarse-grained model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts, prevents lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free membrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes and discussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities (thickness, order parameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces asymmetric changes in lipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the coupled effect of curvature and membrane asymmetry in both number and lipid type. We report the resulting unique morphologies (inducing gel phase, faceting) and behaviors (thickness dependent on adjacent leaflet type) that are accessible with this method.</description>

      <title>A Phase Diagram for Crystallization of a Complex Macromolecular Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization of biological molecules has high potential to solve some challenges in drug manufacturing. Thus, understanding the process is critical to efficiently adapting crystallization to biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This article describes phase behavior for the solution crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids of serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as model biological macromolecular assemblies. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments are used to determine the combined effects of pH and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride concentrations in which full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. Full and empty capsids show different crystallization behavior although they possess similar capsid structure and similar outer morphology with icosahedral symmetry and 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry. The differential charge environment surrounding full and empty capsids is found to influence capsid crystallization. The crystal growth rate is found to be affected by the mass of the macromolecular assembly rather than the structure/shape of the macromolecular assembly. The regions of precipitant concentrations and pH in which crystallization occurs are found to be different for different rAAV serotypes and for full and empty capsids for each serotype. Depending on the precipitant concentrations and the rAAV serotype, a variety of complex crystal morphologies are formed and a variety of non-crystallization outcomes such as unidentified dense solid-phase/opaque crystals and an oil/dense phase is observed. The well-defined dense phase/oil is found to be converted into a solid phase over a long period of time. Trends in the crystallization of full and empty capsids between serotypes is observed to be altered by the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMS) associated with the massive macromolecular proteinaceous assembly.</description>

      <title>Curvature-sensing and generation of membrane proteins: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane proteins are crucial in regulating biomembrane shapes and controlling the dynamic changes in membrane morphology during essential cellular processes. These proteins can localize to regions with their preferred curvatures (curvature sensing) and induce localized membrane curvature. Thus, this review describes the recent theoretical development in membrane remodeling performed by membrane proteins. The mean-field theories of protein binding and the resulting membrane deformations are reviewed. The effects of hydrophobic insertions on the area-difference elasticity energy and that of intrinsically disordered protein domains on the membrane bending energy are discussed. For the crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins, anisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume significantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover, simulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding and colloidal particle adhesion are reviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.</description>

      <title>Active rheology of soft solids performed with acoustical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-beam acoustical tweezers are used to manipulate individual microbubbles and provide quantitative measurements of the local shear modulus of soft hydrogels. The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam's angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provide local values of the medium's shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials opening new opportunities in the field of active rheology.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of molten salts: insights from molecular dynamics simulations and fundamental bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in two common molten salts, LiF and KCl. Our analysis includes the total thermal conductivity and intrinsic conductivity involving mass currents measured experimentally. The latter shows good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate their key thermodynamic properties such as constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats. We subsequently compare the results to the lower bound for thermal diffusivity expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. Using this comparison and recent theoretical insights into thermodynamic and transport properties in liquids, we interpret thermal properties on the basis of atomistic dynamics and phonon excitations. We finally find that thermal diffusivity of molten salts is close to their kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>Director-layer dynamics in the smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the anti-ferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</description>

      <title>Sensitive particle shape dependence of growth-induced mesoscale nematic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed growth, anisotropic cell shapes, and confinement drive self-organization in multicellular systems. We investigate the influence of particle shape on the distribution and dynamics of nematic microdomains in a minimal in-silico model of proliferating, sterically interacting particles, akin to colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. By introducing continuously tuneable tip variations around a common rod shape with spherical caps, we find that subtle changes significantly impact the emergent dynamics, leading to distinct patterns of microdomain formation and stability. Our analysis reveals separate effects of particle shape and aspect ratio, as well as a transition from exponential to scale-free size distributions, which we recapitulate using an effective master equation model. This allows us to relate differences in microdomain size distributions to different physical mechanisms of microdomain breakup. Our results thereby contribute to the characterization of the effective dynamics in growing aggregates at large and intermediate length scales and the microscopic properties that control it. This could be relevant both for biological self-organization and design strategies for future artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Active Loop Extrusion guides DNA-Protein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial organization of DNA involves DNA loop extrusion and the formation of protein-DNA condensates. While the significance of each process is increasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.</description>
