      <title>On the signature of squared distance matrices of metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues of matrices of squared distances between randomly sampled i.i.d. points in a given metric measure space. These numbers and their limits, as the number of points grows, in fact contain some important information about the whole space. In particular, by knowing them, we can determine whether this space can be isometrically embedded in the Hilbert space. We show that the limits of these numbers exist almost surely, are nonrandom and the same for all Borel probability measures of full support, and, moreover, are naturally related to the operators defining the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method. We also relate them to the signature of the pseudo-Euclidean space in which the given metric space can be isometrically embedded. In addition, we provide several examples of explicit calculations or just estimates of those limits for sample metric spaces. In particular, for a large class of countable spaces (for instance, containing all graphs with bounded intrinsic metrics), we get that the number of negative eigenvalues increases to infinity as the size of samples grows. However, we are able to provide examples when the number of samples grows to infinity and the numbers of both negative and positive eigenvalues increases to infinity, or the number of positive eigenvalues is bounded (but as large as desired), and the number of positive ones is fixed. Finally, we consider the example of the universal countable Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Additive Kinematic Formulas for Functional Minkowski Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an additive kinematic formula for the functional Minkowski vectors using mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. These vectors, recently introduced and characterized by the author and F. Mussnig, form a natural family of vector-valued valuations on the space of convex functions. This result represents the first integral geometric application of this characterization.</description>

      <title>Structure of Metric $1$-currents: approximation by normal currents and representation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the $1$-dimensional flat chain conjecture in any complete and quasiconvex metric space, namely that metric $1$-currents can be approximated in mass by normal $1$-currents. The proof relies on a new Banach space isomorphism theorem, relating metric $1$-currents and their boundaries to the Arens-Eells space. As a by-product, any metric $1$-current in a complete and separable metric space can be represented as the integral superposition of oriented $1$-rectifiable sets, thus dropping a finite dimensionality condition from previous results of Schioppa [Schioppa Adv. Math. 2016, Schioppa J. Funct. Anal. 2016]. The connection between the flat chain conjecture and the representation result is provided by a structure theorem for metric $1$-currents in Banach spaces, showing that any such current can be realised as the restriction to a Borel set of a boundaryless normal $1$-current. This generalizes, to any Banach space, the $1$-dimensional case of a recent result of Alberti-Marchese in Euclidean spaces [Alberti-Marchese 2023]. The argument of Alberti-Marchese requires the strict polyhedral approximation theorem of Federer for normal $1$-currents, which we obtain in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees with non-identical leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees summarize evolutionary relationships. The Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space for comparing phylogenetic trees has many elegant mathematical properties, but it does not encompass trees with differing leaf sets. To overcome this, we introduce Towering space: a complete metric space that extends BHV space to trees with non-identical leaf sets. Towering space is a structured collection of BHV spaces connected via pruning and regrafting operations. We study the geometry of paths in Towering space and present an algorithm for computing metric distances. By addressing a major limitation of BHV space, Towering space facilitates the analysis of modern phylogenetic datasets such as multi-domain gene trees.</description>

      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>

      <title>Compressibility Barriers to Neighborhood-Preserving Data Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To what extent is it possible to visualize high-dimensional datasets in a two- or three-dimensional space? We reframe this question in terms of embedding $n$-vertex graphs (representing the neighborhood structure of the input points) into metric spaces of low doubling dimension $d$, in such a way that maintains the separation between neighbors and non-neighbors. This seemingly lax embedding requirement is surprisingly difficult to satisfy. Our investigation shows that an overwhelming fraction of graphs require $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Even when considering sparse regular graphs, the situation does not improve, as an overwhelming fraction of such graphs requires $d= \Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$. The landscape changes dramatically when embedding into normed spaces. In particular, all but a vanishing fraction of graphs demand $d=\Theta(n)$. Finally, we study the implications of these results for visualizing data with intrinsic cluster structure. We find that graphs produced from a planted partition model with $k$ clusters on $n$ points typically require $d=\Omega(\log n)$, even when the cluster structure is salient. These results challenge the aspiration that constant-dimensional visualizations can faithfully preserve neighborhood structure.</description>

      <title>From Lipschitz embedding to Lipschitz equivalence between dust-like self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K,F\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be two dust-like self-similar sets sharing the same Hausdorff dimension. We consider when the mere existence of a Lipschitz embedding from $K$ to $F$ already implies their Lipschitz equivalence. Our main result is threefold: (1) if the Lipschitz image of $K$ intersects $F$ in a set of positive Hausdorff measure, then $K$ admits a Lipschitz surjection onto $F$; (2) if $F$ is in addition homogeneous, then the generating iterated function systems of $K, F$ should have algebraically dependent ratios and consequently, $K$ and $F$ are Lipschitz equivalent; (3) the Lipschitz equivalence can fail without the homogeneity assumption. This answers two questions in Balka and Keleti [Adv. Math. 446 (2024), 109669].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Laplacians on general countable weighted simplicial complexes from a conceptual point of view. These operators will first be introduced formally before showing that those formal operators coincide with self-adjoint realizations of operators arising from quadratic forms. A major conceptual perspective is the correspondence to signed Schr\"odinger operators unveiling the Forman curvature. The main results are criteria for essential self-adjointness via lower bounded Forman curvature and a Gaffney type result via completeness. Finally, we study spectral relations between these Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Structures on Iwahori-Hecke Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iwahori-Hecke algebras are $q$-deformations of group algebras of Coxeter groups. In this article, we initiate a systematic study of quantum metric structures on Iwahori-Hecke algebras by establishing that, for finite rank right-angled Coxeter systems, the canonical filtrations of the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebras satisfy the Haagerup-type condition introduced by Ozawa and Rieffel if and only if the Coxeter diagram's complement contains no induced squares. As a consequence, these algebras naturally inherit compact quantum metric space structures in the sense of Rieffel. Additionally, we investigate continuity phenomena in this framework by demonstrating that, as the deformation parameter $q$ approaches $1$, the deformed Iwahori-Hecke algebras converge to the group algebra of the Coxeter group in Latr\'emoli\`ere's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of one-dimensional metric currents: SBV-representations, connectedness and the flat chain conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of one-dimensional metric currents and their relationship to the geometry of metric spaces is presented. We resolve the one-dimensional flat chain conjecture in this general setting, by proving that its validity is equivalent to a simple geometric connectedness property. More precisely, we prove that metric currents can be approximated in the mass norm by normal currents if and only if every $1$-rectifiable set can be covered by countably many Lipschitz curves up to an $\mathscr{H}^1$-negligible set. Building on this, we demonstrate that any $1$-current in a Banach space can be completed into a cycle by a rectifiable current, with the added mass controlled by the Kantorovich--Rubinstein norm of its boundary. We further refine our approximation result by showing that these currents can be approximated by polyhedral currents modulo a cycle. Finally, in arbitrary complete metric spaces, we establish a Smirnov-type decomposition for one-dimensional currents. This decomposition expresses such currents as a superposition, without mass cancellation, of currents associated with curves of bounded variation that have a vanishing Cantor part.</description>

      <title>Rectifiability of a class of integralgeometric measures and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve a long-standing open problem posed by Federer concerning the rectifiability of the integral geometric measure with exponent p &gt;1, thereby settling a question that has persisted since its formulation. While the main theorem is unchanged from previous versions, the exposition and applications have been substantially revised to highlight the result's consequences for Vitushkin's conjecture on analytic capacity and removability in the complex plane. As an application, we establish two novel results related to Vitushkin's conjecture: in a multi-scale setting, we provide an affirmative answer for sets with finite integral geometric measure within regimes of Favard length behavior at small scales not previously addressed; and in a single-scale framework, we extend the Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem beyond the classical sigma-finite setting, namely for planar sets intersecting a typical line in finitely many points. The rectifiability criterion for general Radon measures via slicing, included in earlier versions, has been removed and will appear in separate work.</description>

Abstract: The classical theorem of Wendel provides an exact formula for the probability that the convex hull of independent symmetrically distributed vectors in ${\mathbb R}^d$ contains the origin as long as the distributions of the vectors are continuous. In this note, we provide an extension to Wendel's theorem for independent random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_n$ with i.i.d components having a (possibly discrete) symmetric distribution of unit variance. As a related observation, we give sharp estimates on the probability that a random linear program of the form ``$\max\langle x,{\mathfrak c}\rangle\quad\mbox{subject to }\langle X_i,x\rangle\leq 1,\;i\leq n$'', is bounded.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension reduction modulus for superlogarithmic distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metric dimension reduction modulus $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is the smallest $k$ such that every $n$--point metric space can be embedded into some $k$-dimensional normed space, with bi--Lipschitz distortion at most $\alpha$. Determining sharp asymptotics for $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is a fundamental task in metric geometry, with $\alpha=\Theta(\log n)$ bearing particular interest. A line of advances over the past decades has led to an upper bound on $k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty)$ for $\alpha = \Omega(\log n)$, but a matching lower bound has remained open. We close this gap, establishing: for every fixed $\beta &gt; 0$, $$ k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty) =\Theta\bigg(\frac{\log n}{\log(\frac{\alpha}{\log n}+1)}\bigg)\quad \mbox{for every $\alpha\geq \beta \log n$}. $$ This resolves a question from Naor's 2018 ICM plenary lecture. Our result is obtained by characterizing the minimum dimension $d$ for which, with high probability, a random regular graph admits an $\alpha$--embedding into some $d$--dimensional normed space.</description>

Abstract: We prove that over a Poncelet triangle family interscribed between two nested ellipses $\E,\E_c$, (i) the locus of the orthocenter is not only a conic, but it is axis-aligned and homothetic to a $90^o$-rotated copy of $\E$, and (ii) the locus of the isogonal conjugate of a fixed point $P$ is also a conic (the expected degree was four); a parabola (resp. line) if $P$ is on the (degree-four) envelope of the circumcircle (resp. on $\E$). We also show that the envelope of both the circumcircle and radical axis of incircle and circumcircle contain a conic component if and only if $\E_c$ is a circle. The former case is the union of two circles!</description>

Abstract: This is the first part of a general description in terms of mass transport for time-evolving interacting particles systems, at a mesoscopic level. Beyond kinetic theory, our framework naturally applies in biology, computer vision, and engineering.
  The central object of our study is a new discrepancy $\mathsf d$ between two probability distributions in position and velocity states, which is reminiscent of the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but of second-order nature. We construct $\mathsf d$ in two steps. First, we optimise over transport plans. The cost function is given by the minimal acceleration between two coupled states on a fixed time horizon $T$. Second, we further optimise over the time horizon $T&gt;0$.
  We prove the existence of optimal transport plans and maps, and study two time-continuous characterisations of $\mathsf d$. One is given in terms of dynamical transport plans. The other one -- in the spirit of the Benamou--Brenier formula -- is formulated as the minimisation of an action of the acceleration field, constrained by Vlasov's equations. Equivalence of static and dynamical formulations of $\mathsf d$ holds true. While part of this result can be derived from recent, parallel developments in optimal control between measures, we give an original proof relying on two new ingredients: Galilean regularisation of Vlasov's equations and a kinetic Monge--Mather shortening principle.
  Finally, we establish a first-order differential calculus in the geometry induced by $\mathsf d$, and identify solutions to Vlasov's equations with curves of measures satisfying a certain $\mathsf d$-absolute continuity condition. One consequence is an explicit formula for the $\mathsf d$-derivative of such curves.</description>

      <title>Torus covers with controlled volume and diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under a lower Ricci curvature bound and an upper diameter bound, a torus admits a finite-sheeted covering space with volume bounded from below and diameter bounded from above. This partially recovers a result of Kloeckner and Sabourau, whose original proof contains a serious gap that currently lacks a resolution.</description>
