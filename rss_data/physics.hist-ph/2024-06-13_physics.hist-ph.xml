      <title>Foundational Issues in Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I offer an introduction to group field theory (GFT) and to some of the issues affecting the foundations of this approach to quantum gravity. I first introduce covariant GFT as the theory that one obtains by interpreting the amplitudes of certain spin foam models as Feynman amplitudes in a perturbative expansion. However, I argue that it is unclear that this definition of GFTs amounts to something beyond a computational rule for finding these transition amplitudes and that GFT doesn't seem able to offer any new insight into the foundations of quantum gravity. Then, I move to another formulation of GFT which I call canonical GFT and which uses the standard structures of quantum mechanics. This formulation is of extended use in cosmological applications of GFT, but I argue that it is only heuristically connected with the covariant version and spin foam models. Moreover, I argue that this approach is affected by a version of the problem of time which raises worries about its viability. Therefore, I conclude that there are serious concerns about the justification and interpretation of GFT in either version of it.</description>

      <title>An Argument for the Non-Arbitrary Existence Hypothesis using Anthropic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses anthropic reasoning to argue for the Non-Arbitrary Existence Hypothesis (NAEH). Nick Bostrom's Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) combined with NAEH is compared against SSA without such an assumption and also SSA with the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA). When considered in the light of various thought experiments, including the Incubator Gedanken, the Doomsday Argument, the Presumptuous Philosopher and Bostrom's Adam and Eve thought experiments, SSA with NAEH is found to give the most plausible results. The possibility of principles not explicitly considered in the paper being superior also is discussed but found to have limited plausibility.</description>
