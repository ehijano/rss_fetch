Abstract: Enormous progress have been made in the last 20 years since the publication of our review \cite{csk05polrev} in this journal on transport and traffic phenomena in biology. In this brief article we present a glimpse of the major advances during this period. First, we present similarities and differences between collective intracellular transport of a single micron-size cargo by multiple molecular motors and that of a cargo particle by a team of ants on the basis of the common principle of load-sharing. Second, we sketch several models all of which are biologically motivated extensions of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP); some of these models represent the traffic of molecular machines, like RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome, that catalyze template-directed polymerization of RNA and proteins, respectively, whereas few other models capture the key features of the traffic of ants on trails. More specifically, using the ASEP-based models we demonstrate the effects of traffic of RNAPs and ribosomes on random and `programmed' errors in gene expression as well as on some other subcellular processes. We recall a puzzling empirical result on the single-lane traffic of predatory ants {\it Leptogenys processionalis} as well as recent attempts to account for this puzzle. We also mention some surprising effects of lane-changing rules observed in a ASEP-based model for 3-lane traffic of army ants. Finally, we explain the conceptual similarities between the pheromone-mediated indirect communication, called stigmergy, between ants on a trail and the floor-field-mediated interaction between humans in a pedestrian traffic. For the floor-field model of human pedestrian traffic we present a major theoretical result that is relevant from the perspective of all types of traffic phenomena.</description>
