      <title>Quasi-metric spaces on which real-valued continuous functions are uniformly continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a quasi-metric space arises by relaxing the requirement of the symmetry axiom in the definition of a metric. This small variation alters several structural properties possessed by a standard metric space. This article aims to investigate the notion of UC quasi-metric spaces in a systematic manner. A quasi-metric space (X, d) is called a UC space if every real-valued continuous function on (X, d) is uniformly continuous. In the context of metric spaces, UC spaces help in bridging the gap between compactness and completeness. These spaces also play an important role in the theory of hyperspaces of closed sets and fixed point theory. In this article, we present several characterizations of UC quasi-metric spaces and provide various examples of such spaces. At several instances, our proof techniques highlight key differences between UC quasi-metric spaces and their metric counterparts.</description>

      <title>Generalized Descriptive Set Theory at Singular Cardinals of Countable Cofinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive development of the basics of descriptive set theory for non-separable complete metric spaces whose weight is a singular cardinal $\lambda$ of countable confinality. Somewhat unexpectedly, the resulting theory is remarkably similar to the classical one, although the methods used are necessarily fairly different and combine ideas and results from general topology, infinite combinatorics, and set theory.
  More in detail, we study $\lambda$-Polish spaces and standard $\lambda$-Borel spaces (characterization of the generalized Cantor and Baire spaces, analogues of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, classification up to $\lambda$-Borel isomorphism, etc.), their $\lambda$-Borel hierarchy (structural properties, changes of topologies, and so on), $\lambda$-analytic sets (including generalizations of the Lusin separation theorem and of the Souslin theorem), $\lambda$-coanalytic sets (including $\lambda$-$\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$-ranks and alike), and $\lambda$-projective sets. We also consider more advanced topics, and provide e.g. various uniformization results for $\lambda$-Borel set; these in turn lead to fundamental applications to the study of $\lambda$-Borel equivalence relations, such as a generalization of the celebrated Feldman-Moore theorem. Finally, we study a natural generalization of the classical Perfect Set Property, and develop tools to show that all definable sets enjoy such property under suitable large cardinal assumptions, most notably including Woodin's $\mathsf{I0}(\lambda)$.</description>
