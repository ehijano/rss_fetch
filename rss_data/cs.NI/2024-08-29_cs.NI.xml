      <title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Scheme for SFC Placement in Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 5G era and beyond, it is favorable to deploy latency-sensitive and reliability-aware services on edge computing networks in which the computing and network resources are more limited compared to cloud and core networks but can respond more promptly. These services can be composed as Service Function Chains (SFCs) which consist of a sequence of ordered Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). To achieve efficient edge resources allocation for SFC requests and optimal profit for edge service providers, we formulate the SFC placement problem in an edge environment and propose a multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheme to address the problem. The proposed scheme employs a set of RL agents to collaboratively make SFC placement decisions, such as path selection, VNF configuration, and VNF deployment. Simulation results show our model can improve the profit of edge service providers by 12\% compared with a heuristic solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-domain Network Slice Partitioning: A Graph Neural Network Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of multi-domain network slices, multiple domains need to work together to provide a service. The problem of determining which part of the service fits within which domain is referred to as slice partitioning. The partitioning of multi-domain network slices poses a challenging problem, particularly when striving to strike the right balance between inter-domain and intra-domain costs, as well as ensuring optimal load distribution within each domain. To approach the optimal partition solution while maintaining load balance between domains, a framework has been proposed. This framework not only generates partition plans with various characteristics but also employs a Graph Neural Network solver, which significantly reduces the plan generation time. The proposed approach is promising in generating partition plans for multi-domain network slices and is expected to improve the overall performance of the network.</description>

      <title>Predicting Parameter Change's Effect on Cellular Network Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular network provides convenient network access for ever-growing mobile phones. During the continuous optimization, operators can adjust cell parameters to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) flexibly. A precise prediction of the parameter change's effect can help operators make proper parameter adjustments. This work focuses on predicting cell status (like the workload and QoS) after adjusting the cell parameters. The prediction will be conducted before an adjustment is actually applied to provide an early inspection. As it can be hard for available parameter adjustments with a limited number to cover all the parameter and user behavior combinations, we propose ParaSeer fusing domain knowledge on parameter adjustments into data-driven time series forecasting. ParaSeer organizes several pre-trained Transformers for adjustment-free time series forecasting, utilizing plenty of adjustment-free data. On the other hand, ParaSeer models the effect of adjusting the transmission power and cell individual offset (CIO) as a multiplier for the workload. We derive a formula to calculate the multiplier from the underlying mechanism of those two parameters, helping ParaSeer eliminate the thirst for data with parameter adjustments. We compare ParaSeer with baselines on two real-world datasets, where ParaSeer outperforms the best baseline by more than 25.8% in terms of RMSE. The extensive experiments further illustrate the contributions of ParaSeer's components.</description>

      <title>An eBPF-Based Trace-Driven Emulation Method for Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System-level performance evaluation over satellite networks often requires a simulated or emulated environment for reproducibility and low cost. However, the existing tools may not meet the needs for scenarios such as the low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. To address the problem, this paper proposes and implements a trace-driven emulation method based on Linux's eBPF technology. Building a Starlink traces collection system, we demonstrate that the method can effectively and efficiently emulate the connection conditions, and therefore provides a means for evaluating applications on local hosts.</description>

      <title>Statistical QoS Provision in Business-Centric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More refined resource management and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning is a critical goal of wireless communication technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel Business-Centric Network (BCN) aimed at enabling scalable QoS provisioning, based on a cross-layer framework that captures the relationship between application, transport parameters, and channels. We investigate both continuous flow and event-driven flow models, presenting key QoS metrics such as throughput, delay, and reliability. By jointly considering power and bandwidth allocation, transmission parameters, and AP network topology across layers, we optimize weighted resource efficiency with statistical QoS provisioning. To address the coupling among parameters, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is Collaborative Optimization among Heterogeneous Actors with Experience Sharing (COHA-ES). Power and sub-channel (SC) Actors representing multiple APs are jointly optimized under the unified guidance of a common critic. Additionally, we introduce a novel multithreaded experience-sharing mechanism to accelerate training and enhance rewards. Extensive comparative experiments validate the effectiveness of our DRL framework in terms of convergence and efficiency. Moreover, comparative analyses demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the BCN structure in enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semantic and goal-oriented edge computing for satellite Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Semantic Communications (SemCom) and edge computing in space networks enables the optimal allocation of the scarce energy, computing, and communication resources for data-intensive applications. We use Earth Observation (EO) as a canonical functionality of satellites and review its main characteristics and challenges. We identify the potential of the space segment, represented by a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, to serve as an edge layer for distributed intelligence. Based on that, propose a system architecture that supports semantic and goal-oriented applications for image reconstruction and object detection and localization. The simulation results show the intricate trade-offs among energy, time, and task-performance using a real dataset and State-of-the-Art (SoA) processing and communication parameters.</description>

      <title>Agricultural On-Demand Networks for 6G enabled by THz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transforming process in the scope of agriculture towards Smart Agriculture is an essential step to fulfill growing demands in respect to nourishment. Crucial challenges include establishing robust wireless communication in rural areas, enabling collaboration among agricultural machines, and integrating artificial intelligence into farming practices. Addressing these challenges necessitates a consistent communication system, with wireless communication emerging as a key enabler. Cellular technologies, as 5G and its successor 6G, can offer a comprehensive solution here. Leveraging technologies following the ITU-R M. 2160 recommendation like THz communication, low-latency wireless AI, and embedded sensing, can provide a flexible and energy-efficient infrastructure. This paper introduces on-demand networks based on the OpenRAN approach and a 7.2 functional split. By implementing THz front-hauling between components, a flexible application of 5G or future 6G networks can be realized. Experiments demonstrate that THz communication is suitable for data transmission over the eCPRI interface, particularly in terms of data rate, thereby reducing the need for wired alternatives such as fiber optic cables. Furthermore, limitations such as limited range are discussed, and possible initial solutions are presented. The integration of the OpenRAN standard further enhances flexibility, which is crucial in dynamic agricultural environments. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the transformative potential of 6G-enabled wireless communication in shaping the future of smart agriculture.</description>

      <title>EdgeLinker: Practical Blockchain-based Framework for Healthcare Fog Applications to Enhance Security in Edge-IoT Data Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pervasive adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly advanced healthcare digitization and modernization. Nevertheless, the sensitive nature of medical data presents security and privacy challenges. On the other hand, resource constraints of IoT devices often necessitates cloud services for data handling, introducing single points of failure, processing delays, and security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the blockchain technology offers potential solutions for enhancing security, decentralization, and data ownership. An ideal solution should ensure confidentiality, access control, and data integrity while being scalable, cost-effective, and integrable with the existing systems. However, current blockchain-based studies only address some of these requirements. Accordingly, this paper proposes EdgeLinker; a comprehensive solution incorporating Proof-of-Authority consensus, integrating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control, and advanced cryptographic algorithms for secure data communication between IoT edge devices and the fog layer in healthcare fog applications. This novel framework has been implemented in a real-world fog testbed, using COTS fog devices. Based on a comprehensive set of evaluations, EdgeLinker demonstrates significant improvements in security and privacy with reasonable costs, making it an affordable and practical system for healthcare fog applications. Compared with the state-of-the-art, without significant changes in the write-time to the blockchain, EdgeLinker achieves a 35% improvement in data read time. Additionally, it is able to provide better throughput in both reading and writing transactions compared to the existing studies. EdgeLinker has been also examined in terms of energy, resource consumption and channel latency in both secure and non-secure modes, which has shown remarkable improvements.</description>

      <title>LIMO: Load-balanced Offloading with MAPE and Particle Swarm Optimization in Mobile Fog Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fog computing is essentially the expansion of cloud computing towards the network edge, reducing user access time to computing resources and services. Various advantages attribute to fog computing, including reduced latency, and improved user experience. However, user mobility may limit the benefits of fog computing. The displacement of users from one location to another, may increase their distance from a fog server, leading into latency amplification. This would also increase the probability of over utilization of fog servers which are located in popular destinations of mobile edge devices. This creates an unbalanced network of fog devices failing to provide lower makespan and fewer cloud accesses. One solution to maintain latency within an acceptable range is the migration of fog tasks and preserve the distance between the edge devices and the available resources. Although some studies have focused on fog task migration, none of them have considered load balancing in fog nodes. Accordingly, this paper introduces LIMO; an allocation and migration strategy for establishing load balancing in fog networks based on the control loop MAPE (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The periodical migration of tasks for load balancing aims to enhance the system's efficiency. The performance of LIMO has been modeled and evaluated using the Mobfogsim toolkit. The results show that this technique outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of network resource utilization with 10% improvement. Furthermore, LIMO reduces the task migration to cloud by more than 15%, while it reduces the request response time by 18%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless technology is seen as one of the enablers of real-time fusion of the physical and digital realms, as in Digital Twin, eXtended reality, or the Metaverse. This would allow people to interact, work, and entertain themselves in an immersive social network of online 3D~virtual environments. From the viewpoint of communication and networking, this will represent an evolution of the \emph{game networking} technology, designed to interconnect massive users in real-time online gaming environments. This article presents the basic principles of game networking and discusses their evolution towards meeting the requirements of the Metaverse and similar applications. Several open research challenges are discussed, along with possible solutions through experimental case studies.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Systems with Dynamic User Utility Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained significant attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most related studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently, computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters change. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that allows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their application layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as the policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm iteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA)--RA without considering user utility demands--among active users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. Derived convergence analyses provide guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical experiments corroborate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, scientists are trying to improve the entanglement swapping success rate by researching anti-noise technology on the physical level, thereby obtaining a higher generation rate of long-distance entanglement. However, we may improve the generation rate from another perspective, which is studying an efficient entanglement swapping strategy. This paper analyzes the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping strategies, including the node allocation principle, time synchronization, and processing of entanglement swapping failure. We present Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping (PSES) to solve these problems. The core idea of PSES is to segment the path and perform parallel entanglement swapping between segments to improve the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. We construct a tree-like model as the carrier of PSES and propose heuristic algorithms called Layer Greedy and Segment Greedy to transform the path into a tree-like model. Moreover, we realize the time synchronization and design the on-demand retransmission mechanism to process entanglement swapping failure. The experiments show that PSES performs superiorly to other entanglement swapping strategies, and the on-demand retransmission mechanism can reduce the average entanglement swapping time by 80% and the average entanglement consumption by 80%.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Federation Framework and Prototype for Open, Scalable, and Shared Access to NextG and IoT Testbeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new federation framework for UnionLabs, an innovative cloud-based resource-sharing infrastructure designed for next-generation (NextG) and Internet of Things (IoT) over-the-air (OTA) experiments. The framework aims to reduce the federation complexity for testbeds developers by automating tedious backend operations, thereby providing scalable federation and remote access to various wireless testbeds. We first describe the key components of the new federation framework, including the Systems Manager Integration Engine (SMIE), the Automated Script Generator (ASG), and the Database Context Manager (DCM). We then prototype and deploy the new Federation Plane on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud, demonstrating its effectiveness by federating two wireless testbeds: i) UB NeXT, a 5G-and-beyond (5G+) testbed at the University at Buffalo, and ii) UT IoT, an IoT testbed at the University of Utah. Through this work we aim to initiate a grassroots campaign to democratize access to wireless research testbeds with heterogeneous hardware resources and network environment, and accelerate the establishment of a mature, open experimental ecosystem for the wireless community. The API of the new Federation Plane will be released to the community after internal testing is completed.</description>
