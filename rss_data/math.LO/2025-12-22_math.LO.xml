      <title>Deconstructible classes of modules and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every deconstructible class of modules with all embeddings, all pure embedding and all RD-embeddings is stable. The argument is presented in the context of abstract classes of modules without amalgamation and the key idea is to construct a stable-like independence relation.
  In particular, the following classes of modules with all embeddings, all pure embedding and all RD-embeddings are shown to be stable: all free and torsion-free modules over any ring, and for each $n \geq 0$, the classes of all modules of projective and flat dimension $\leq n$ over any ring, and the class of all modules of injective dimension $\leq n$ over any right noetherian ring.</description>

      <title>Yet another cubical type theory, but via a semantic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new cubical type theory, termed (self-deprecatingly) the naive cubical type theory, and study its semantics using the universe category framework, which is similar to Uemura's categories with representable morphisms. In particular, we show that this new type theory admits an interpretation in a wide variety of settings, including simplicial sets and cartesian cubical sets.</description>

      <title>Blockwise Gluings And Amalgamation Failures in Integral Residuated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the blockwise gluing construction. This describes residuated integral chains which can be decomposed into (possibly) partial algebras, stacked one on top of the other, and such that elements in a certain component multiply in blocks, i.e., in the same way, with respect to lower components. This construction generalizes that of 1-sums (or ordinal sums). As first main results, we provide finite axiomatizations for varieties generated by particular chains that are gluings of their archimedean components. For such varieties we also prove the finite embeddability property, and as a consequence, the decidability of their universal theory. Moreover, we solve in the negative several longstanding open problems in the literature about the amalgamation property (AP). Indeed, we provide denumerably many new examples of varieties lacking the AP, including: semilinear (commutative) integral residuated lattices, semilinear FL_w-algebras, MTL-algebras, involutive and pseudocomplemented MTL-algebras, and all their n-potent subvarieties for n &gt; 1. For the commutative varieties, this also entails that the associated substructural logics do not have the deductive interpolation property.</description>

      <title>Probabilities are always axiomatizable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the interaction between logic and probability. In particular, we show that the convex hull of evaluations of a broad class of logics is always effectively axiomatizable. We define a Birkhoff-style calculus for probability axioms for which compactness, and finite completeness is proved. We give example for a logic for which probabilities are not finitely axiomatizable.</description>

      <title>Foundations for an Abstract Proof Theory in the Context of Horn Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, logic-independent framework for the study of sequent-style proof systems, which covers a number of proof-theoretic formalisms and concrete proof systems that appear in the literature. In particular, we introduce a generalized form of sequents, dubbed 'g-sequents,' which are taken to be binary graphs of typical, Gentzen-style sequents. We then define a variety of 'inference rule types' as sets of operations that act over such objects, and define 'abstract (sequent) calculi' as pairs consisting of a set of g-sequents together with a finite set of operations. Our approach permits an analysis of how certain inference rule types interact in a general setting, demonstrating under what conditions rules of a specific type can be permuted with or simulated by others, and being applicable to any sequent-style proof system that fits within our framework. We then leverage our permutation and simulation results to establish generic calculus and proof transformation algorithms, which show that every abstract calculus can be effectively transformed into a lattice of polynomially equivalent abstract calculi. We determine the complexity of computing this lattice and compute the relative sizes of proofs and sequents within distinct calculi of a lattice. We recognize that top and bottom elements in lattices correspond to many known deep-inference nested sequent systems and labeled sequent systems (respectively) for logics characterized by Horn properties.</description>

      <title>Weihrauch problems as containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We note that Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and that Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. We also show that Bauer's extended Weihrauch degrees and the posetal reflection of containers over partition assemblies are equivalent. Using this characterization, we show how a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, such as the composition product, also arise naturally from the abstract theory of polynomial functors.</description>
