      <title>Transverse instability of hybrid solitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse instability of two-component solitons forming in a planar waveguide operating in the regime of strong light-matter coupling. The instability emerges as a result of the coupling between transverse diffraction of the photonic component and nonlinearity of the material excitations. Solutions of three different forms are addressed which include bright, gray-dark, and gray-gray solitons. In the limit of long-wavelength transverse perturbations, the instability is described with an asymptotic expansion whose predictions agree with the results of numerical simulations. The dynamic development of instability of initially perturbed bright solitons leads to the formation of high-intensity spots in the photonic component. For gray-dark and dark-dark solitons, the transverse instability leads to the spontaneous nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs which emerge in both fields as transient patterns.</description>

      <title>Recurrence in a periodically driven and weakly damped Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report numerical evidence of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT)-like recurrence in weakly damped, periodically driven alpha-FPUT chains. In narrow regions of driving amplitude and damping, energy is quasi-periodically exchanged among a few low-frequency modes over long timescales. Unlike discrete time crystals, the recurrence period is not an integer multiple of the driving period and does not correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking, yet it may suggests a generalized, relaxed form of time-crystalline-like order. The maximum damping allowing recurrence decreases rapidly with chain length, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit such behavior is unlikely to persist. These results reveal a new type of coherent nonlinear dynamics in driven, open multimode systems and provide guidance for experimentally realizing long-lived quasi-periodic states.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <title>Properties of Non-topological Solitons in Two-dimensional Model With Resurrected Conformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>CFT-approach to Rotating Field Lumps in Attractive Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transmission line: shock waves and the simple wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transmission lines we consider are constructed from the nonlinear inductors and the nonlinear capacitors. In the first part of the paper we additionally include linear ohmic resistors. Thus, the dissipation being taken into account leads to the existence of \mbox{shocks -- the} travelling waves with different asymptotically constant values of the voltage (the capacitor charge) and the current before and after the front of the wave. For the particular values of ohmic resistances (corresponding to strong dissipation) we obtain the analytic solution for the profile of a shock wave. Both the charge on a capacitor and current through the inductor are obtained as the functions of the time and space coordinate. In the case of weak dissipation, we obtain the stationary dispersive shock waves. In the second part of the paper we consider the nonlinear lossless transmission line. We formulate a simple wave approximation for such transmission line, which decouples left/right-going waves. The approximation can also be used for the lossy transmission line, which is considered in the first part of the paper, to describe the formation of the shock wave (but, of course, not the shock wave itself).</description>
