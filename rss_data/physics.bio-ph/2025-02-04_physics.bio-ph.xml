      <title>Dynamical equivalence between resonant translocation of a polymer chain and diversity-induced resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of heterogeneous oscillators are often seen to display collective synchronized oscillations, even when single elements of the network do not oscillate in isolation. It has been found that it is the diversity of the individual elements that drives the phenomenon, possibly leading to the appearance of a resonance in the response. Here we study the way in which heterogeneity acts in producing an oscillatory regime in a network and show that the resonance response is based on the same physics underlying the resonant translocation regime observed in models of polymer diffusion on a substrate potential. Such a mechanical analog provides an alternative viewpoint that is useful to interpret and understand the nature of collective oscillations in heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Emamectin benzoate sensing using vivianenes (2D vivianites)</title>

Abstract: The excessive application of pesticides, particularly the overreliance on insecticides for the protection of desirable crops from pests, has posed a significant threat to both ecological systems and human health due to environmental pollution. This research outlines a comprehensive approach to recognizing and quantifying the presence of insecticides through the application of spectroscopic and electrochemical sensing methods. The detection of Emamectin benzoate (EB), a commonly used insecticide, was performed utilizing vivianenes, a 2D phosphate that has been mechanically exfoliated from the naturally occurring vivianite minerals. This investigation examined the structural and compositional characteristics of vivianenes, utilizing a range of characterization methods. The spectroscopic analyses reveal the molecular interactions and structural modifications that take place during the interaction of EB with the 2D template. Electrochemical investigations employing cyclic voltammetry were performed for different concentrations of EB to enable real-time monitoring of the pesticide. The modified sensing electrode using vivianene demonstrated a linear range of from 50 mg/L to 10 micro g/L, effectively detecting EB molecules at levels significantly below the hazardous threshold. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out to obtain further insights into the interaction mechanisms of the EB with the vivianites, and the results corroborate the adsorption mechanism. Our results highlight the potential application of 2D phosphate minerals as advanced sensors to enhance agricultural monitoring and promote sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Accelerated recrystallization of nanocrystalline films as a manifestation of the inner size effect of the diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the recrystallization of 100 nm thick polycrystalline films of copper and silver. It is found that in copper films deposited by the thermal evaporation method onto a substrate at room temperature, a bimodal crystallite size distribution with maxima at 15 and 35 nm is observed. The bimodal distribution in copper films is preserved during annealing, which leads to a shift of both peaks of the crystallite size distribution histograms to the larger sizes region. In contrast to Cu, micron-sized crystallites are present even in as-deposited Ag films besides the nanosized fraction. These grains are formed due to the phenomenon of self-annealing and weakly evolve during heating owing to grain growth stagnation. The nanosized fraction in as-deposited Ag films is represented by crystallites with the most probable size of 25 nm, which increases to 50 nm as a result of short-term annealing at the temperature of 250{\deg}C. The grain-boundary diffusion coefficient was determined, which is more than 10-18 m2/s for both films of metals. The obtained value indicates a multiple intensification of self-diffusion processes in films, the thickness of which allows us to refer them to macroscopic sample</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in model biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Information Exchange in Zebrafish: The Role of U-Turns in Visual Communication and Behavior Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motions of visually coupled zebrafish pairs are studied to understand the effects of information exchange on their behavior as a function of their minimal separation ($d$). We find that when $d$ is small, the pair can display a leader-follower relation (LFR) with trajectories of almost synchronized form. However, with larger $d$, although the same LFR is still maintained, the originally similar trajectories turn into different forms. Detailed analysis of their motion trajectories suggests that the pair might be using U-turns (UTs) to exchange information and to maintain a LFR at the same time. A simulation model based on UTs with inferred and proposed rules is able to reproduce prominent features of observed trajectories; indicating that the transition of trajectories can be understood as the result of a change in information exchange between the fish as $d$ increases. Our finding that UTs as important visual signals is consistent with the fact that UTs can induce a large amount of firings in retinas of observing fish.</description>

      <title>An Operating Principle of the Cerebral Cortex, and a Cellular Mechanism for Attentional Trial-and-Error Pattern Learning and Useful Classification Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10821</link>

Abstract: A feature of the brains of intelligent animals is the ability to learn to respond to an ensemble of active neuronal inputs with a behaviorally appropriate ensemble of active neuronal outputs. Previously, a hypothesis was proposed on how this mechanism is implemented at the cellular level within the neocortical pyramidal neuron: the apical tuft or perisomatic inputs initiate "guess" neuron firings, while the basal dendrites identify input patterns based on excited synaptic clusters, with the cluster excitation strength adjusted based on reward feedback. This simple mechanism allows neurons to learn to classify their inputs in a surprisingly intelligent manner. Here, we revise and extend this hypothesis. We modify synaptic plasticity rules to align with behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) observed in hippocampal area CA1, making the framework more biophysically and behaviorally plausible. The neurons for the guess firings are selected in a voluntary manner via feedback connections to apical tufts in the neocortical layer 1, leading to dendritic Ca2+ spikes with burst firing, which are postulated to be neural correlates of attentional, aware processing. Once learned, the neuronal input classification is executed without voluntary or conscious control, enabling hierarchical incremental learning of classifications that is effective in our inherently classifiable world. In addition to voluntary, we propose that pyramidal neuron burst firing can be involuntary, also initiated via apical tuft inputs, drawing attention towards important cues such as novelty and noxious stimuli. We classify the excitations of neocortical pyramidal neurons into four categories based on their excitation pathway: attentional versus automatic and voluntary/acquired versus involuntary. Additionally, we hypothesize that dendrites within pyramidal neuron minicolumn bundles are coupled via depolarization...</description>
