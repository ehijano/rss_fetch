      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Robust Distributed Wireless Clock Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed wireless clock synchronization is essential for aligning the clocks of distributed transceivers in support of joint transmission and reception techniques. One recently explored method involves synchronizing distributed transceivers using a two-tone waveform, where the tones are separated in frequency by a clock (frequency) reference signal. Prior research has demonstrated frequency accuracy better than 1 Hz; however, this approach remains vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional interference. In this demonstration, we present a robust, frequency-hopped two-tone waveform that enables transceivers to extract the reference signal without prior knowledge of the exact frequency at which the tones are transmitted.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Hybrid Beamforming Framework for MIMO Cell-Free ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach, while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.</description>

      <title>A closed-loop $2\times4$ downlink MIMO Framework for 5G New Radio using OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first-of-a-kind closed-loop $2\times4$ MIMO implementation for the downlink of 5G Open RAN using OpenAirInterface (OAI), which is capable of transmitting up to two transmission layers. Our implementation is a fully functional 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including the 5G Core Network (5G CN), 5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN), as well as 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This serves as a foundational framework for further advancements in the context of emerging Open RAN (O-RAN) development. A key feature of our implementation is the enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure at the UE, which includes Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). It is adjusted for the extended configuration to maximize data rates. To demonstrate the performance of our implementation, we measure the downlink data rates using $\textit{iperf3}$ in two scenarios: (i) fixed channels to assess two-layer data transmission and (ii) $\textit{Rice1}$ channels for general transmission analysis. The obtained simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the existing $2\times2$ MIMO configuration in the OAI, our implementation improves the data rates in almost all scenarios, especially at the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs).</description>

      <title>An Implementation of Multi-User MIMO Downlink for O-RAN 5G New Radio using OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission scheme on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). Our implementation features a fully functional O-RAN-compliant 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including a 5G Core Network (5G CN), a refined 5G RAN, which is split into a Centre Unit (CU) and an Distributed Unit (DU), and 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This implementation demonstrates MU-MIMO performance in the downlink while showcasing the disaggregation capabilities of O-RAN. Specifically, the Base Station (i.e. gNB) in our setup is capable of serving two UEs simultaneously over the same downlink Resource Block (RBs). User scheduling is performed based on the Precoding Matrix Indicators (PMIs) reported by the UEs according to the NR Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure. The system throughput performance is evaluated using $\textit{iperf}$. The obtained results via simulation and testbed experiments demonstrate that the MU-MIMO scheme achieves significant downlink throughput gains, particularly in the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regime, while keeping the Block Error Rate (BLER) below the required threshold of $10^{-1}$ for both UEs.</description>

      <title>Joint UE positioning and distributed sensing in the upper mid-band exploiting virtual apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks exploiting distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) nodes can provide enhanced localization and sensing performance, further emphasized when operating with large arrays and bandwidths available in the upper mid-band (also known as FR3). In this paper, we consider a DISAC system operating at FR3 where a single base station (BS) acts as the transmitter and several vehicular user equipments (UEs) act as the receivers. We tackle the design of the signal processing chain at the UE side to enable joint UE positioning and target localization. The system model exploits a multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) waveform, and incorporates practical effects such as inter-node timing offsets (TOs), extended targets, dense multipath, and realistic uniform planar arrays (UPAs) at both ends. The proposed design includes a multipath estimation stage at each UE, clutter removal, a novel clustering and association scheme, and a final joint estimator of UE positions and target locations. The estimator solves a weighted least squares (WLS) problem to jointly compute clock offsets and localize UEs and targets. Numerical results considering two UEs and two targets show that for 80\% of the cases the target localization error is below 32cm, while the UE positioning error is below 44cm.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25656v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>

      <title>A Novel Statistical Analysis Method for Radiation Source Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of electronic information technology, the number and variety of unknown radiation sources have increased significantly. Some of these sources share common characteristics, which offers the potential to effectively address the challenge of identifying unknown radiation sources. However, research on the classification of radiation sources remains relatively limited. This paper proposes a big data analysis method that combines linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with a rough neighborhood set (NRS) for radiation source classification, and its effectiveness is validated on the RadioML 2018 dataset. The results indicate that, under certain constraints, all modulation types can be categorized into four distinct classes, laying a foundation for further research on cognitive interference signal cancellation.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Rate Prediction for Multi-Band Cellular Handsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3. These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays, our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Doppler-Based Multistatic Drone Tracking via Cellular Downlink Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multistatic Doppler sensing system is proposed for the drone tracking via downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals. Specifically, the LTE base stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic Doppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is shown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle, the Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory tracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the initial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by solving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler measurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone and all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating BSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90 centimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range resolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory tracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler detection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Exploring the Impact of Twinning Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments, we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity, especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Measurements and Modeling in High-Speed Railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system. Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly, the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third, via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication designs for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Least-Squares Design of Fast-Convolution Based Variable-Bandwidth FIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a closed-form least-squares (LS) design approach for fast-convolution (FC) based variable-bandwidth (VBW) finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters. The proposed LS design utilizes frequency sampling and the VBW filter frequency-domain implementation using the overlap-save (OLS) method, that together offer significant savings in implementation and online bandwidth reconfiguration complexities. Since combining frequency-domain design and OLS implementation leads to a linear periodic time-varying (LPTV) behavior of the VBW filter, a set of the corresponding time-invariant impulse responses is considered in the proposed design. Through numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach enables not only closed-form design of FC-based VBW filters with substantial complexity reductions compared to existing solutions for a given performance, but also allows the variable bandwidth range to be extended without any increase in complexity. Moreover, a way of reducing the maximum approximation error energy over the whole set of the time-invariant filters of the LPTV system is shown by introducing appropriate weighting functions in the design.</description>

      <title>Joint Communications, Sensing, and Positioning in 6G Multi-Functional Satellite Systems: Survey and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed, covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT (JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges, including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) for the 6G and beyond space era.</description>

      <title>Neural Network State-Space Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical state estimation algorithms rely on predefined target's state-space model, which complicates model derivation and limits adaptability when system dynamics change. Neural network based estimators offer a data-driven alternative, but rarely fuse classical estimation theory into their structure and demand large, pre-computed training sets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified state-space structure without target's state-space model and treats both the input-layer activations and all network weights as latent states to be estimated online. We instantiate this nonlinear model with three canonical estimators-the extended Kalman estimator, the unscented Kalman estimator, and the particle estimator to simulate different neural network and demonstrate its generality. We then benchmark our approach against seven leading neural network estimators across three representative scenarios.

      <title>Performance Evaluation of eLoran Spatial ASF Corrections Based on Measured ASF Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of spatial ASF correction methods in the Korean eLoran system using measured ASF maps. Three correction scenarios were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only localized benefits.</description>

      <title>Path-Based Correlation Analysis of Meteorological Factors and eLoran Signal Delay Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike GNSS, which is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing due to its inherently weak received power, eLoran exhibits robustness owing to its high field strength. Therefore, the eLoran system can maintain reliable operation even in scenarios where GNSS becomes unavailable. However, since eLoran signals propagate through ground waves, the propagation delay is susceptible to changes in surface conditions, including both terrain and meteorological variations. This study aims to analyze the correlation between the temporal variations in eLoran signal propagation delay and meteorological factors at various points along the signal path.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Connectivity for Emergency Vehicles Through UAV Trajectory and Resource Allocation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication for emergency vehicles - such as ambulances and fire trucks - is essential to support their operations in various traffic and environmental conditions. In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular communication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which adjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication needs. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying service requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous data rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To support both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization approach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate for normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an instantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into account some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption, mobility limitations, and backhaul capacity. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, an iterative optimization method is employed, where the original problem is decomposed into two subproblems: bandwidth allocation and UAV trajectory design. In each iteration, the trajectory subproblem is solved using the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results confirm that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in meeting service requirements compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Secrecy-Driven Beamforming for Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework for multi-user systems with multiple communication users (CUs) and adversarial targets, where the design problem is formulated to maximize secrecy rate under joint sensing and communication constraints. An efficient solution is presented based on an accelerated fractional programming method using a non-homogeneous complex quadratic transform (QT), which decomposes the problem into tractable subproblems for beamforming and artificial noise (AN) optimization. Unlike conventional artificial noise strategies, the proposed approach also exploits AN to enhance sensing while avoiding interference with legitimate users. Simulation results show significant gains in secrecy rate, communication reliability, and sensing accuracy, confirming the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>FinGAN: An Interpretable RSS Generation Network for Scalable Fingerprint Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces FinGAN, a robust received signal strength (RSS) data generator designed to expand RSS fingerprint datasets. Compared to existing generative adversarial models that either rely on known reference positions (RPs) or depend on predefined priors, FinGAN learns the latent information between RPs and RSS values by maximizing the mutual information between the generated RSS data and the RPs, enabling an end-to-end RSS generation directly from RPs. This allows us to accurately generate RSS data for previously unmeasured RPs. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that FinGAN produces synthetic RSS data closely aligned with real RSS sample collected from the on-site experiment, preserving localization performance comparable to that achieved with complete real-world datasets. To further validate its generalizability, FinGAN is also trained and evaluated on open-source datasets from three typical office environments,and the results demonstrate consistent performance across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Reliable Risk-Aggregated Sum Rate Maximization via Model-Aided Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.</description>

      <title>Transmitter-Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for 6G wireless networks, offering more advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation than conventional diagonal RIS. This paper proposes a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework that incorporates BD-RIS at the transmitter. This not only opens the door to enhanced sensing and communication performance, but also alleviates the need for large-scale fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains at the transmitter. Based on the proposed system model, we formulate a normalized weighted optimization problem to jointly design the active beamforming and the BD-RIS scattering matrix with the aim of jointly minimizing the trace of the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing targets and maximizing the sum rate (SR) for communication users. To address this highly coupled optimization problem, we propose a novel and low-complexity iterative algorithm that efficiently solves the active beamforming and scattering matrix subproblems by transforming each into a series of tractable projection problems with closed-form solutions. Numerical results show the appealing capability of the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided ISAC over conventional diagonal RIS-aided ISAC in enhancing both sensing and communication performance. Moreover, compared to the classic iterative algorithm, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced dual-functional performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Framework for Label-Free Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and intelligent assessment of post-earthquake structural damage is critical for rapid disaster response. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled datasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To address this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain adaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target building without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates actual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the target structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the similarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight matrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the multi-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a discriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive and accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the features remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied as weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features from each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for assessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, significantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>

      <title>Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Single-Carrier Joint Communication and Sensing: Loss Design, Constellation Shaping and Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems. Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder-based system. To improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper bounds of the sensing and communication performance, namely the Cram\'er-Rao bound for AoA estimation and the mutual information for communication. The NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output to address the improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments. Our contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Secure ISAC with Fluid Antenna Systems: Joint Precoding and Port Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing physical-layer security in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging the reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FAS). We propose a joint precoding and port selection (JPPS) strategy that maximizes the sum secrecy rate while simultaneously ensuring reliable radar sensing. The problem is formulated using fractional programming (FP) and solved through an iterative algorithm that integrates FP transformations with successive convex approximation (SCA). To reduce computational complexity, we further develop low-complexity schemes based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, combined with greedy port selection and trace-inverse minimization. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in both secrecy performance and sensing accuracy compared to conventional baselines, across a wide range of FAS ports, user loads, and sensing targets. These findings highlight the critical importance of FAS geometry optimization in enabling secure and efficient joint communication-sensing for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference Framework for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth, provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU) and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.</description>

      <title>The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN, including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for future HetNets.</description>

      <title>Fast Energy-Theft Attack on Frequency-Varying Wireless Power without Additional Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently, the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable, since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation. However, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated system, which can intrude and steal energy within 0.2 ms. The key is the elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be given great attention.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming in Multi-User Multi-IRS Millimeter Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of cell-free Massive MIMO represents a transformative shift in wireless network architecture, addressing critical limitations of conventional distributed Massive MIMO systems. This paper presents an intelligent radio network planning framework that bridges legacy 5G infrastructures with future B5G/6G networks through cell-free architectures. By leveraging operational insights from existing 5G deployments, we systematically address coverage optimization, and capacity enhancement. Our scalable framework enables seamless evolution from legacy designs to next-generation cell-free systems. Through extensive simulations in dense urban environments, we demonstrate substantial improvements: 45% spectral efficiency gains, 30% interference reduction, and significantly enhanced uniform coverage. The proposed framework provides network operators with a practical roadmap for transitioning from traditional cellular architectures to demanding B5G/6G requirements while maximizing existing infrastructure investments.</description>

      <title>YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Precoding for Multi-RIS-Aided Multiuser Downlink Systems with Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.</description>

      <title>Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>Graph Distribution-valued Signals: A Wasserstein Space Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity, while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts, demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of electroencephalography (EEG) in educational research has grown substantially, yet a comprehensive integration of methodological frameworks, educational constructs, computational methods, and research gaps remains limited. This study applies a Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review (BenSLR) to provide a systematic overview of EEG in education. Literature was extracted from Scopus, screened, and analyzed, with keyword co-occurrence evaluated using VOSviewer and emerging trends visualized through an Enhanced Strategic Diagram via BiblioPlot. Key findings include engagement, attention, and learning style as prominent constructs, with machine learning and deep learning frequently employed for modeling complex cognitive states. EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and affective states were recurrent across studies. Innovative interventions such as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting adaptive and individualized learning experiences. Challenges remain in linking neural markers with observable learning behaviors, extending measurements beyond attention and working memory, and enhancing predictive model generalizability. The study demonstrates BenSLR's potential to integrate qualitative and quantitative perspectives and offers a transferable approach for other research areas to develop methodologies and evidence-based educational interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04774v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio access networks (RANs) in monolithic architectures have limited adaptability to supporting different network scenarios. Recently, open-RAN (O-RAN) techniques have begun adding enormous flexibility to RAN implementations. O-RAN is a natural architectural fit for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, where many geographically-distributed access points (APs) are employed to achieve ubiquitous coverage and enhanced user performance. In this paper, we address the decentralized pilot assignment (PA) problem for scalable O-RAN-based CFmMIMO systems. We propose a low-complexity PA scheme using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework in which multiple learning agents perform distributed learning over the O-RAN communication architecture to suppress pilot contamination. Our approach does not require prior channel knowledge but instead relies on real-time interactions made with the environment during the learning procedure. In addition, we design a codebook search (CS) scheme that exploits the decentralization of our O-RAN CFmMIMO architecture, where different codebook sets can be utilized to further improve PA performance without any significant additional complexities. Numerical evaluations verify that our proposed scheme provides substantial computational scalability advantages and improvements in channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Robust Sensor Selection Strategies for Wireless Positioning with TOA/RSS Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging wireless applications are requiring ever more accurate location-positioning from sensor measurements. In this paper, we develop sensor selection strategies for 3D wireless positioning based on time of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSS) measurements to handle two distinct scenarios: (i) known approximated target location, for which we conduct dynamic sensor selection to minimize the positioning error; and (ii) unknown approximated target location, in which the worst-case positioning error is minimized via robust sensor selection. We derive expressions for the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as a performance metric to quantify the positioning accuracy resulted from selected sensors. For dynamic sensor selection, two greedy selection strategies are proposed, each of which exploits properties revealed in the derived CRLB expressions. These selection strategies are shown to strike an efficient balance between computational complexity and performance suboptimality. For robust sensor selection, we show that the conventional convex relaxation approach leads to instability, and then develop three algorithms based on (i) iterative convex optimization (ICO), (ii) difference of convex functions programming (DCP), and (iii) discrete monotonic optimization (DMO). Each of these strategies exhibits a different tradeoff between computational complexity and optimality guarantee. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategies provide significant improvements in terms of accuracy and/or complexity compared to existing sensor selection methods.</description>

Abstract: Recently, deep learning approaches have provided solutions to difficult problems in wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have attained excellent and consistent performance against complex channel environments, the computational complexity coming from processing high-dimensional features can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a novel positioning neural network (P-NN) that utilizes the minimum description features to substantially reduce the complexity of deep learning-based WP. P-NN's feature selection strategy is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We improve P-NN's learning ability by intelligently processing two different types of inputs: sparse image and measurement matrices. Specifically, we implement a self-attention layer to reinforce the training ability of our network. We also develop a technique to adapt feature space size, optimizing over the expected information gain and the classification capability quantified with information-theoretic measures on signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP). In particular, we find that P-NN achieves a large improvement in performance for low SNR, as unnecessary measurements are discarded in our minimum description features.</description>

      <title>LISAC: Learned Coded Waveform Design for ISAC with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose deep learning based coded waveform design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Our goal is to design a coded waveform capable of delivering accurate target parameter estimation while maintaining high communication quality measured in terms of bit error rate (BER). In the proposed learned coded waveform for ISAC (LISAC), the pilot and data encoding functions at the encoder are parameterized by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. The communication receiver estimates the channel and performs residual-assisted minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel equalization, where a neural network is introduced to calibrate the coarse estimate produced by the standard MMSE channel equalizer. Then, an RNN-based channel decoder is employed to decode the information bits using the equalized signal. Two different sensing loss functions are considered, one calculates the mean square error (MSE) between the original and the estimated sensing parameters, while the other calculates the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The LISAC modules are optimized using a weighted combination of communication and sensing losses and different trade-off points between the sensing and communication performances are achieved by adjusting the weights. Simulation results show that the proposed LISAC waveform achieves a better trade-off curve compared to existing alternatives for both AWGN and multi-path fading scenarios. Ablation studies are carried out to demonstrate the gain brought by each design component for a better understanding of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO with 1-Bit DACs: Data Detection for Quantized Linear Precoding with Dithering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft estimation.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Enabling Drone Detection with SWARM Repeater-Assisted MIMO ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-RIS): Scattering Matrix Design via Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA), an innovative communication scheme that utilizes the modulation of artificial noise mean and variance to convey information. Distinct from traditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) that heavily rely on successive interference cancellation (SIC), ND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and system complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly suitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical analyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally low bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of Rician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a minimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for variance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By leveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising platform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Inverse Drum Machine, a novel approach to Drum Source Separation that leverages an analysis-by-synthesis framework combined with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that require isolated stem recordings for training, our approach is trained on drum mixtures with only transcription annotations. IDM integrates Automatic Drum Transcription and One-shot Drum Sample Synthesis, jointly optimizing these tasks in an end-to-end manner. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets, akin to a drum machine, we reconstruct the individual drum stems and train a Deep Neural Network on the reconstruction of the mixture. Experiments on the StemGMD dataset demonstrate that IDM achieves separation quality comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods that require isolated stems data.</description>

      <title>Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</description>
