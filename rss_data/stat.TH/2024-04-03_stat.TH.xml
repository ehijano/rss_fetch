      <title>Small diffusivity asymptotics for a linear parabolic SPDE in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parameter estimation of the reaction term for a second order linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation in two space dimensions driven by a $Q$-Wiener process under small diffusivity. We first construct an estimator of the reaction parameter based on continuous spatio-temporal data, and then derive an estimator of the reaction parameter based on high frequency spatio-temporal data by discretizing the estimator based on the continuous data. We show that the estimators have consistency and asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we give simulation results of the estimator based on high frequency data.</description>

      <title>FDR control and FDP bounds for conformal link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Marandon (2023), the author introduces a procedure to detect true edges from a partially observed graph using a conformal prediction fashion: first computing scores from a trained function, deriving conformal p-values from them and finally applying a multiple testing procedure. In this paper, we prove that the resulting procedure indeed controls the FDR, and we also derive uniform FDP bounds, thanks to an exchangeability argument and the previous work of Marandon et al. (2022).</description>

      <title>Estimation of the long-run variance of nonlinear time series with an application to change point analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a broad class of nonlinear time series known as Bernoulli shifts, we establish the asymptotic normality of the smoothed periodogram estimator of the long-run variance. This estimator uses only a narrow band of Fourier frequencies around the origin and so has been extensively used in local Whittle estimation. Existing asymptotic normality results apply only to linear time series, so our work substantially extends the scope of the applicability of the smoothed periodogram estimator. As an illustration, we apply it to a test of changes in mean against long-range dependence. A simulation study is also conducted to illustrate the performance of the test for nonlinear time series.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of bivariate Conditional Transition Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature has found conditional transition rates to be a useful tool for avoiding Markov assumptions in multistate models. While the estimation of univariate conditional transition rates has been extensively studied, the intertemporal dependencies captured in the bivariate conditional transition rates still require a consistent estimator. We provide an estimator that is suitable for censored data and emphasize the connection to the rich theory of the estimation of bivariate survival functions. Bivariate conditional transition rates are necessary for various applications in the survival context but especially in the calculation of moments in life insurance mathematics.</description>

      <title>Invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work sets forth the analytical tools which make it possible to construct and compute invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices. The main result is the $\mathrm{L}^1$--\,Godement theorem, which is used to obtain a general analytical expression that yields any invariant kernel which is, in a certain natural sense, also integrable. Using this expression, one can design and explore new families of invariant kernels, all while incurring a rather moderate computational effort. The expression comes in the form of a determinant (it is a determinantal expression), and is derived from the notion of spherical transform, which arises when the space of complex covariance matrices is considered as a Riemannian symmetric space.</description>

      <title>A simple lower bound for the complexity of estimating partition functions on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of estimating the partition function ${\mathsf{Z}}(\beta)=\sum_{x\in\chi} e^{-\beta H(x)}$ for a Gibbs distribution characterized by the Hamiltonian $H(x)$. We provide a simple and natural lower bound for quantum algorithms that solve this task by relying on reflections through the coherent encoding of Gibbs states. Our primary contribution is a $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound for the number of reflections needed to estimate the partition function with a quantum algorithm. We also prove a $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ query lower bound for classical algorithms. The proofs are based on a reduction from the problem of estimating the Hamming weight of an unknown binary string.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Connection Between the Normalized Power Prior and Bayesian Hierarchical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power prior is a popular class of informative priors for incorporating information from historical data. It involves raising the likelihood for the historical data to a power, which acts as a discounting parameter. When the discounting parameter is modeled as random, the normalized power prior is recommended. Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a widely used method for synthesizing information from different sources, including historical data. In this work, we examine the analytical relationship between the normalized power prior (NPP) and Bayesian hierarchical models (BHM) for \emph{i.i.d.} normal data. We establish a direct relationship between the prior for the discounting parameter of the NPP and the prior for the variance parameter of the BHM. Such a relationship is first established for the case of a single historical dataset, and then extended to the case with multiple historical datasets with dataset-specific discounting parameters. For multiple historical datasets, we develop and establish theory for the BHM-matching NPP (BNPP) which establishes dependence between the dataset-specific discounting parameters leading to inferences that are identical to the BHM. Establishing this relationship not only justifies the NPP from the perspective of hierarchical modeling, but also provides insight on prior elicitation for the NPP. We present strategies on inducing priors on the discounting parameter based on hierarchical models, and investigate the borrowing properties of the BNPP.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence to the local time of Oscillating and Skew Brownian Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.04858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of statistics based on high frequency observations of oscillating and skew Brownian motion is considered. Their convergence rate towards the local time of the underlying process is obtained in form of a functional limit theorem. Oscillating and skew Brownian motion are solutions to stochastic differential equations with singular coefficients: piecewise constant diffusion coefficient or additive local time finite variation term. The result is applied to provide estimators of the skewness parameter and study their asymptotic behavior, and diffusion coefficient estimation is discussed as well. Moreover, in the case of the classical statistics given by the normalized number of crossings, the result is proved to hold for a larger class of It\^o processes with singular coefficients. Up to our knowledge, this is the first result proving the convergence rates for estimators of the skewness parameter of skew Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Concentration of discrepancy-based approximate Bayesian computation via Rademacher complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest on summary-free versions of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which replace distances among summaries with discrepancies between the empirical distributions of the observed data and the synthetic samples generated under the proposed parameter values. The success of these solutions has motivated theoretical studies on the limiting properties of the induced posteriors. However, current results (i) are often tailored to a specific discrepancy, (ii) require, either explicitly or implicitly, regularity conditions on the data generating process and the assumed statistical model, and (iii) yield bounds depending on sequences of control functions that are not made explicit. As such, there is the lack of a theoretical framework that (i) is unified, (ii) facilitates the derivation of limiting properties that hold uniformly, and (iii) relies on verifiable assumptions that provide concentration bounds clarifying which factors govern the limiting behavior of the ABC posterior. We address this gap via a novel theoretical framework that introduces the concept of Rademacher complexity in the analysis of the limiting properties for discrepancy-based ABC posteriors. This yields a unified theory that relies on constructive arguments and provides more informative asymptotic results and uniform concentration bounds, even in settings not covered by current studies. These advancements are obtained by relating the properties of summary-free ABC posteriors to the behavior of the Rademacher complexity associated with the chosen discrepancy within the family of integral probability semimetrics. This family extends summary-based ABC, and includes the Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), among others. As clarified through a focus on the MMD case and via illustrative simulations, this perspective yields an improved understanding of summary-free ABC.</description>

Abstract: We study the recovery of the underlying graphs or permutations for tensors in the tensor ring or tensor train format. Our proposed algorithms compare the matricization ranks after down-sampling, whose complexity is $O(d\log d)$ for $d$-th order tensors. We prove that our algorithms can almost surely recover the correct graph or permutation when tensor entries can be observed without noise. We further establish the robustness of our algorithms against observational noise. The theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Posterior Robustness with Milder Conditions: Contamination Models Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust Bayesian linear regression is a classical but essential statistical tool. Although novel robustness properties of posterior distributions have been proved recently under a certain class of error distributions, their sufficient conditions are restrictive and exclude several important situations. In this work, we revisit a classical two-component mixture model for response variables, also known as contamination model, where one component is a light-tailed regression model and the other component is heavy-tailed. The latter component is independent of the regression parameters, which is crucial in proving the posterior robustness. We obtain new sufficient conditions for posterior (non-)robustness and reveal non-trivial robustness results by using those conditions. In particular, we find that even the Student-$t$ error distribution can achieve the posterior robustness in our framework. A numerical study is performed to check the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution based on full data and that based on data obtained by removing outliers.</description>

      <title>Principal Stratification with Continuous Post-Treatment Variables: Nonparametric Identification and Semiparametric Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-treatment variables often complicate causal inference. They appear in many scientific problems, including noncompliance, truncation by death, mediation, and surrogate endpoint evaluation. Principal stratification is a strategy to address these challenges by adjusting for the potential values of the post-treatment variables, defined as the principal strata. It allows for characterizing treatment effect heterogeneity across principal strata and unveiling the mechanism of the treatment's impact on the outcome related to post-treatment variables. However, the existing literature has primarily focused on binary post-treatment variables, leaving the case with continuous post-treatment variables largely unexplored. This gap persists due to the complexity of infinitely many principal strata, which present challenges to both the identification and estimation of causal effects. We fill this gap by providing nonparametric identification and semiparametric estimation theory for principal stratification with continuous post-treatment variables. We propose to use working models to approximate the underlying causal effect surfaces and derive the efficient influence functions of the corresponding model parameters. Based on the theory, we construct doubly robust estimators and implement them in an R package.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Tests of Group Invariance through Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many standard statistical hypothesis tests, including those for normality and exchangeability, can be reformulated as tests of invariance under a group of transformations. We develop anytime-valid tests of invariance under the action of general compact groups and show their optimality -- in a specific logarithmic-growth sense -- against certain alternatives. This is achieved by using the invariant structure of the problem to construct conformal test martingales, a class of objects associated to conformal prediction. We apply our methods to extend recent anytime-valid tests of independence, which leverage exchangeability, to work under general group invariances. Additionally, we show applications to testing for invariance under subgroups of rotations, which corresponds to testing the Gaussian-error assumptions behind linear models.</description>
