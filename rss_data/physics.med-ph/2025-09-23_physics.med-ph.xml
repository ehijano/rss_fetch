      <title>Non-invasive Reversible Software-based Configuration of a Clinically Used Linear Accelerator for Preclinical Electron FLASH Radiobiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configuring clinical linear accelerators (linacs) for ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) electron experiments typically requires invasive hardware manipulation and/or irreversible manufacturer modifications, limiting broader implementation. We present an independently developed UHDR electron configuration of a clinical TrueBeam linac that allows reversible switching between preclinical UHDR and conventional (CONV) modes using only non-invasive software settings. UHDR mode was achieved via service mode software with RF and beam current settings typical of a photon beam, the photon target and monitor chamber retracted, and a clinically unused low-energy scattering foil inserted. An external AC current transformer (ACCT) for beam monitoring, anatomy-specific collimator, and sample holder were mounted on the accessory tray, with external ion chamber in solid water for exit dose monitoring. Percent depth dose (PDD) was measured for UHDR and CONV beams. Dose-per-pulse (DPP) was varied by adjusting gun voltage and quantified with radiochromic film at different source-to-surface distances (SSD). Beam profiles assessed dose uniformity and usable field size. Dose calibration was established between film, ACCT, and ion chamber, and day-to-day reproducibility was tested. PDD confirmed similar energies for UHDR (12.8MeV) and CONV (11.9MeV) beams with matching profiles through mouse thickness. Maximum DPP exceeded 0.5Gy, reaching ~1.5Gy for collimated in vivo setups and ~0.7Gy at extended SSD for tissue culture. Field flatness and symmetry were maintained, supporting organ-specific irradiations and up to 5cm fields for culture. Calibration showed strong linearity across detectors, and output variation was &lt;4%. We demonstrated accurate, reproducible UHDR delivery on a widely available clinical linac with no invasive hardware manipulation, enabling preclinical FLASH research on a clinical treatment machine.</description>

      <title>In vivo and predictive interplay evaluation methodology for lung and esophageal cancer patients treated in free breathing with IMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Pencil beam scanning proton therapy is sensitive to respiratory motion, leading to potential dose inhomogeneities due to interplay effects. We developed and validated a predictive framework to assess interplay and motion robustness in lung and esophageal cancer patients treated under free-breathing conditions. Methods: A synthetic-breathing-based predictive model was implemented in the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) and validated against an in vivo approach using patient-specific respiratory traces and machine log files. Both were benchmarked against the Monte Carlo engine FRED. To demonstrate the methodology, the framework was applied to two clinical cases treated on the Mevion S250i system without rescanning. Dose accumulation incorporated respiratory phase, range ($\pm$3 %), and setup ($\pm$5 mm) uncertainties. Results: Excellent agreement was observed between TPS and FRED ($&lt;$1 % mean dose difference) and between predictive and in vivo models ($&lt;$2 % across DVH metrics). Cumulative dose distributions for the primary CTV converged after five fractions, confirming robust delivery. Conclusions: This automated, clinically integrated framework enables pre-treatment prediction and in vivo validation of interplay and motion robustness in PBS plans. Preliminary results support its clinical utility, especially for hypofractionation and targets with large motion ($&gt;$2 cm). A larger cohort study is ongoing and will be reported separately.</description>

      <title>Exploring Machine Learning Models for Physical Dose Calculation in Carbon Ion Therapy Using Heterogeneous Imaging Data - A Proof of Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurate and fast dose calculation is essential for optimizing carbon ion therapy. Existing machine learning (ML) models have been developed for other radiotherapy modalities. They use patient data with uniform CT imaging properties. Purpose: This study investigates the application of several ML models for physical dose calculation in carbon ion therapy and compares their ability to generalize to CT data with varying resolutions. Among the models examined is a Diffusion Model, which is tested for the first time for the calculation of physical dose distributions. Methods: A dataset was generated using publicly available CT images of the head and neck region. Monoenergetic carbon ion beams were simulated at various initial energies using Geant4 simulation software. A U-Net architecture was developed for dose prediction based on distributions of material density in patients and of absorbed dose in water. It was trained as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generator, a Diffusion Model noise estimator, and as a standalone network. Their performances were compared with two models from literature. Results: All models produced dose distributions deviating by less than 2% from that obtained by a full Monte Carlo simulation, even for a patient not seen during training. Dose calculation time on a GPU was in the range of 3 ms to 15 s. The resource-efficient U-Net appears to perform comparably to the more computationally intensive GAN and Diffusion Model. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ML models can effectively balance accuracy and speed for physical dose calculation in carbon ion therapy. Using the computationally efficient U-Net can help conserve resources. The generalizability of the models to different CT image resolutions enables the use for different patients without extensive retraining.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Models for CT Image Synthesis from CBCT: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides a low-dose imaging alternative to conventional CT, but suffers from noise, scatter, and artifacts that degrade image quality. Synthetic CT (sCT) aims to translate CBCT to high-quality CT-like images for improved anatomical accuracy and dosimetric precision. Although deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often face limitations in generalizability and detail preservation. Conditional diffusion models (CDMs), with their iterative refinement process, offers a novel solution. This review systematically examines the use of CDMs for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis.
  Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Inclusion criteria targeted works employing conditional diffusion models specifically for sCT generation. Eleven relevant studies were identified and analyzed to address three questions: (1) What conditional diffusion methods are used? (2) How do they compare to conventional deep learning in accuracy? (3) What are their clinical implications?
  Results: CDMs incorporating anatomical priors and spatial-frequency features demonstrated improved structural preservation and noise robustness. Energy-guided and hybrid latent models enabled enhanced dosimetric accuracy and personalized image synthesis. Across studies, CDMs consistently outperformed traditional deep learning models in noise suppression and artefact reduction, especially in challenging cases like lung imaging and dual-energy CT.
  Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models show strong potential for generalized, accurate sCT generation from CBCT. However, clinical adoption remains limited. Future work should focus on scalability, real-time inference, and integration with multi-modal imaging to enhance clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and Computational Radiobiology for Precision Radiopharmaceutical Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the evolving field of radiobiology, emphasizing the need for advanced multiscale, mechanistic models to optimize radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). While the traditional linear-quadratic (LQ) model underpins external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), RPT's unique biological and spatial complexities demand new approaches. First-principles simulations of DNA damage, repair, and multicellular responses are crucial for understanding therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The integration of these models into personalized, digital twin frameworks promises transformative clinical applications, but progress depends on deep mechanistic insights, experimental validation, and balancing model complexity with practicality for clinical use.</description>

      <title>RootletSeg: Deep learning method for spinal rootlets segmentation across MRI contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for the automatic segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets on various MRI scans. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private dataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE (T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model, RootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets. Training was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was used to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method. Spinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with vertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults (mean age, 28.70 years $\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females) achieved a mean $\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\pm$ 0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1 contrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively increasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15 mm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg accurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the determination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is open-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including lesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group analysis.</description>

      <title>Moire Artifact Reduction in Grating Interferometry Using Multiple Harmonics and Total Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray interferometry is an emerging imaging modality with a wide range of potential clinical applications, including lung and breast imaging, as well as non destructive testing in fields such as additive manufacturing and porosimetry. A grating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic interference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern, producing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and small angle scattering, known as the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. Image artifacts unique to X-ray interferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly sinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating position, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to Moire artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that estimates the true phase stepping positions using multiple harmonics and total variation regularization, removing the Moire artifacts present in the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. We demonstrate the algorithm's utility for the Talbot-Lau and Modulated Phase Grating interferometers by imaging multiple samples, including PMMA microspheres and a euthanized mouse.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling of Selective Capture Mechanisms in Conduction System Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CSP is gaining clinical significance owing to its ability to restore a physiological activation sequence in the ventricles. While His bundle pacing (HBP) producing the most physiological activation is preferable, due to implant complications the selective activation of the LBB by left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is considered an alternative, offering both a simpler implant and a physiological activation sequence. However, the physical mechanisms facilitating selective activation of the LBB remain poorly understood. We developed a structurally and biophysically detailed computer model of the IVS and LBB to quantitatively elucidate the role of lead position, orientation and polarity in achieving optimal s-LBBP thresholds, using a geometrically detailed model of a clinically widely used CSP lead. A deep implant within the LV sub-endocardium ensuring a direct contact between electrode and LBB is key for effective s-LBBP. For low strength s-LBBP is feasible, but capturing the LBB in its entirety could only be achieved using higher strengths that led to non-selective left bundle branch pacing (ns-LBBP). Switching the tip polarity to anodal was not beneficial, requiring higher strengths to activate the LBB. Lead orientation relative to the LBB bundles was found to influence the s-LBBP capture threshold and the number of synchronously activating bundles. The model explains the impedance trends that are clinically observed when advancing the tip through the IVS into the LBB region, as well as sudden impedance drops associated with implant complications such as septal perforation or lead dislodgement. Quantitative consistence with clinically observed trends support model credibility, and indicate that simulation may offer an effective approach for guiding the design of improved CSP leads, facilitating a selective and synchronous activation of the entire LBB.</description>

      <title>Medical AI Consensus: A Multi-Agent Framework for Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating radiology report generation poses a dual challenge: building clinically reliable systems and designing rigorous evaluation protocols. We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Nitric Oxide in Trigeminal Neuralgia Rats with a Cerium Single-Atom Nanozyme Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Multi-needle Localization for Pelvic Seed Implant Brachytherapy based on Tip-handle Detection and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100 patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic effects of intra- and supra- deployment locations for a bioprosthetic aortic valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aortic valve replacement is a key surgical procedure for treating aortic valve pathologies, such as stenosis and regurgitation. The precise placement of the prosthetic valve relative to the native aortic annulus plays a critical role in the post-operative hemodynamics. This study investigates how the positioning of a biological prosthetic valve - either intra-annular (within the native annulus) or supra-annular (slightly downstream, in the widened portion of the aortic root) - affects cardiac fluid dynamics. Using high-fidelity numerical simulations on a patient-specific left heart model derived from CT imaging, we simulate physiological flow conditions to isolate the impact of valve placement. Unlike previous clinical studies that compare different patients and valve models, our approach evaluates the same valve in both positions within a single virtual patient, ensuring a controlled comparison. Key hemodynamic parameters are assessed, including transvalvular pressure drop, effective orifice area, wall shear stress, and hemolysis. Results reveal that supra-annular implantation offers significant advantages: lower pressure gradients, larger orifice area, and reduced shear-induced stress. Furthermore, hemolysis analysis using advanced red blood cell stress models indicates a decreased risk of blood damage in the supra-annular configuration. These findings offer valuable insights to guide valve selection and implantation strategies, ultimately supporting improved patient outcomes.</description>
