      <title>Tetragonal modular quotients $X_0^{+d}(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a positive integer. For every $d | N$ such that $(d, N/d) = 1$ there exists an Atkin-Lehner involution $w_d$ of a modular curve $X_0(N)$. In this paper we determine all quotient curves $X_0(N)/w_d$ whose $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality is equal to $4$ and all quotient curves $X_0(N)/w_d$ whose $\mathbb{C}$-gonality is equal to $4$.</description>

      <title>On arithmetic nature of $q$-analogue of the generalized Stieltjes constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, our aim is to extend the research conducted by Kurokawa and Wakayama in 2003, particularly focusing on the $q$-analogue of the Hurwitz zeta function. Our specific emphasis lies in exploring the coefficients in the Laurent series expansion of a $q$-analogue of the Hurwitz zeta function around $s=1$. We establish the closed-form expressions for the first two coefficients in the Laurent series of the $q$-Hurwitz zeta function. Additionally, utilizing the reflection formula for the digamma function and the identity of Bernoulli polynomials, we explore transcendence results related to $\gamma_0(q,x)$ for $q&gt;1$ and $0 &lt; x &lt;1$, where $\gamma_0(q,x)$ is the constant term which appears in the Laurent series expansion of $q$-Hurwitz zeta function around $s=1$.
  Furthermore, we put forth a conjecture about the linear independence of special values of $\gamma_0(q,x)$ along with $1$ at rational arguments with co-prime conditions, over the field of rational numbers. Finally, we show that at least one more than half of the numbers are linearly independent over the field of rationals.</description>

      <title>The $a$-number of $y^n=x^m+x$ over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formula for $a$-number of certain maximal curves characterized by the equation $y^{\frac{q+1}{2}} = x^m + x$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. $a$-number serves as an invariant for the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. Utilizing the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathcal{X}, \Omega^1)$, we establish a closed formula for $a$-number of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

      <title>End behavior of Ramanujan's taxicab numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized taxicab numbers are the smallest positive integers that are the sum of exactly $j$, positive $k$-th powers in exactly $m$ distinct ways. This paper is considers for which values of $m$ does a smallest such integer exist as $j$ gets large. There appear to be only two possible outcomes, leading to curious results like there is no positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of exactly $10$ positive squares in exactly $3$ ways. This paper resolves a number of conjectures found in the OEIS by considering generalized Taxicab numbers in the setting of the theory of partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly which positive integers cannot be expressed as the sum of $j$ positive $k$-th powers? This paper utilizes theoretical and computational techniques to answer this question for $k\leq9$. Results from Waring's problem are used throughout to catalogue the sets of such integers. These sets are then considered in a general setting, and several curious properties are established.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of K-Fibonacci sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $K$-Fibonacci sequence is a binary recurrence sequence where $F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, and $F_n=K\cdot F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. These sequences are known to be periodic modulo every positive integer greater than $1$. If the length of one shortest period of a $K$-Fibonacci sequence modulo a positive integer is equal to the modulus, then that positive integer is called a $\textit{fixed point}$. This paper determines the fixed points of $K$-Fibonacci sequences according to the factorization of $K^2+4$ and concludes that if this process is iterated, then every modulus greater than $3$ eventually terminates at a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Farey fractions with equal numerators and the rank of unit fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical expressions are derived for the number of fractions with equal numerators in the Farey sequence of order $n$, $F_n$, and in the truncated Farey sequence $F_n^{1/k}$ containing all Farey fractions below $1/k$, with $1\leq k \leq n$. These developments lead to an expression for the rank of $1/k$ in $F_n$, or equivalently $\left|F_n^{1/k}\right|$, and to remarkable relations between the ranks of different unit fractions. Furthermore, the results are extended to Farey fractions of the form $2/k$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Determinant of a Dense Matrix over Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, practical algorithm for computing the determinant of a non-singular dense, uniform matrix over Z; the aim is to achieve better practical efficiency, which is always at least as good as currently known methods. The algorithm uses randomness internally, but the result is guaranteed correct. The main new idea is to use a modular HNF in cases where the Pauderis--Storjohann HCOL method performs poorly. The algorithm is implemented in OSCAR~1.0.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties that split modulo all but finitely many primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a simple abelian variety over a number field $k$ such that $\operatorname{End}(A)$ is noncommutative. We show that $A$ splits modulo all but finitely many primes of $k$. We prove this by considering the subalgebras of $\operatorname{End}(A_{\mathfrak p})\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ which have prime Schur index. Our main tools are Tate's characterization of endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties over finite fields, and a Theorem of Chia-Fu Yu on embeddings of simple algebras.</description>

      <title>Twisted correlations of the divisor function via discrete averages of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ Poincar\'e series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a theorem that allows one to count solutions to determinant equations twisted by a periodic weight with high uniformity in the modulus. It is obtained by using spectral methods of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ automorphic forms to study Poincar\'e series over congruence subgroups while keeping track of interactions between multiple orbits. In this way we get advantages over the widely used sums of Kloosterman sums techniques. We showcase the method with applications to correlations of the divisor functions twisted by periodic functions and the fourth moment of Dirichlet $L$-functions on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Polynomial sumset structures on $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05226v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can build the following results: (1) For any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$; (2) For any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ and any $P\in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with positive leading coefficient and zero constant term, there exist infinite subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $P(C)\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $B\subset P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $B+P(C)$ is monochromatic. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, the above results may be the best.</description>

      <title>On a coarse invertibility spectrum for coarse groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse algebraic invariant for coarse groups and use it to differentiate various coarsifications of the group of integers. This lets us answer two questions posed by Leitner and the second author. The invariant is obtained by considering the set of exponents n such that taking n-th powers defines a coarse equivalence of the coarse group.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Statistics of a Random Model of Zeta over Intervals of Varying Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arguin, Dubach &amp; Hartung recently conjectured that an intermediate regime exists between IID and log-correlated statistics for extreme values of a random model of the Riemann zeta function. For the same model, we prove a matching upper and lower tail for the distribution of its maximum. This tail interpolates between that of the two aforementioned regimes. We apply the result to yield a new sharp estimate on moments over short intervals, generalizing a result by Harper. In particular, we observe a hybrid regime for moments with a distinctive transition to the IID regime for intervals of length larger than $\exp(\sqrt{\log \log T})$.</description>

Abstract: Let $K_n$ be a tamely ramified cyclic quintic field generated by a root of Emma Lehmer's parametric polynomial. We give all normal integral bases for $K_n$ only by the roots of the polynomial, which is a generalization of the work of Lehmer in the case that $n^4+5n^3+15n^2+25n+25$ is prime number, and Spearman-Willliams in the case that $n^4+5n^3+15n^2+25n+25$ is square-free.</description>

      <title>General multiple Dirichlet series from perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb F_q(T)$, generalizing a set of axioms given by Diaconu and Pasol. The key axiom, relating the coefficients at prime powers to sums of the coefficients, formalizes an observation of Chinta. The existence of multiple Dirichlet series satisfying these axioms is proved by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of explicit perverse sheaves and using properties of perverse sheaves. The multiple Dirichlet series defined this way include, as special cases, many that have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider expansions of vectors by a general class of multidimensional continued fraction algorithms. If the expansion is eventually periodic, then we describe the possible structure of a matrix corresponding to the repetend, and use it to prove that a number of vectors has an eventually periodic expansion in the Algebraic Jacobi--Perron Algorithm. Further, we give criteria for vectors to have purely periodic expansions; in particular, the vector cannot be totally positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider finite graphs whose vertexes are supersingular elliptic curves, possibly with level structure, and edges are isogenies. They can be applied to the study of modular forms and to isogeny based cryptography. The main result of this paper says that these graphs have the Ramanujan property, which means that the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices are as small as possible. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices, the number of connected components, the automorphisms of the graphs, and the connection between the graphs and modular forms.</description>

      <title>Rankin--Cohen Type Differential Operators on Hermitian Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Rankin-Cohen type differential operators on Hermitian modular forms of signature $(n,n)$. The bilinear differential operators given here specialize to the original Rankin-Cohen operators in the case $n=1$, and more generally satisfy some analogous properties, including uniqueness. Our approach builds on previous work by Eholzer-Ibukiyama in the case of Siegel modular forms, together with results of Kashiwara-Vergne on the representation theory of unitary groups.</description>

      <title>Explicit lower bound for large gaps between some consecutive primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p_{n}$ denote the $n$th prime and for any fixed positive integer $k$ and $X\geq 2$, put \[ G_{k}(X):=\max _{p _{n+k}\leq X} \min \{ p_{n+1}-p_{n}, \ldots , p_{n+k}-p_{n+k-1} \}. \] Ford, Maynard and Tao proved that there exists an effective abosolute constant $c_{LG}&gt;0$ such that \[ G_{k}(X)\geq \frac{c_{LG}}{k^{2}}\frac{\log X \log \log X \log \log \log \log X}{\log \log \log X} \] holds for any sufficiently large $X$. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the constant $c_{LG}$ above. We see that $c_{LG}$ is determined by several factors related to analytic number theory, for example, the ratio of integrals of functions in the multidimensional sieve of Maynard, the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions to large moduli, and the coefficient of upper bound sieve of Selberg. We prove that the above inequality is valid at least for $c_{LG}\approx 2.0\times 10^{-17}$.</description>

Abstract: For $G$ and $H_1,\dots, H_n$ finite groups, does there exist a $3$-manifold group with $G$ as a quotient but no $H_i$ as a quotient? We answer all such questions in terms of the group cohomology of finite groups. We prove non-existence with topological results generalizing the theory of semicharacteristics. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the (profinite completion of) the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold in the Dunfield-Thurston model of random Heegaard splittings as the genus goes to infinity. We believe this is the first construction of a new distribution of random groups from its moments.</description>

      <title>The generic dual of p-adic groups and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a uniform classification of the generic dual of quasi-split classical groups, their similitude counterparts, and general spin groups. As applications, for quasi-split classical groups, we show that the functorial lifting maps constructed by Cogdell, Kim, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shahidi are surjective. We also analyze structures of general local Langlands parameters and explicitly construct a distinguished element for each local L-packet.</description>
