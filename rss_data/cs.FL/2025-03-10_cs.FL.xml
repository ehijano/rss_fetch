      <title>Efficient Analysis of Polynomial Asymptotic Estimates for VASS MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov decision process over vector addition system with states (VASS MDP) is a finite state model combining non-deterministic and probabilistic behavior, augmented with non-negative integer counters that can be incremented or decremented during each state transition. VASS MDPs can be used as abstractions of probabilistic programs with many decidable properties. In this paper, we develop techniques for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of VASS MDPs. That is, for every initial configuration of size \(n\), we consider the number of transitions needed to reach a configuration with some counter negative. We show that given a strongly connected VASS MDP there either exists an integer \(k\leq 2^d\cdot 3^{|T|} \), where \(d \) is the dimension and \(|T|\) the number of transitions of the VASS MDP, such that for all \(\epsilon&gt;0 \) and all sufficiently large \(n\) it holds that the complexity of the VASS MDP lies between \(n^{k-\epsilon} \) and \(n^{k+\epsilon} \) with probability at least \(1-\epsilon \), or it holds for all \(\epsilon&gt;0 \) and all sufficiently large \(n\) that the complexity of the VASS MDP is at least \(2^{n^{1-\epsilon}} \) with probability at least \(1-\epsilon \). We show that it is decidable which case holds and the \(k\) is computable in time polynomial in the size of the considered VASS MDP. We also provide a full classification of asymptotic complexity for VASS Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Stochastic Systems under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the verification problem of stochastic systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We propose a novel approach that enables the verification of the probabilistic satisfaction of STL specifications for nonlinear systems subject to both bounded deterministic disturbances and stochastic disturbances. Our method, referred to as the STL erosion strategy, reduces the probabilistic verification problem into a deterministic verification problem with a tighter STL specification. The degree of tightening is determined by leveraging recent results on bounding the deviation between the stochastic trajectory and the deterministic trajectory. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with any existing deterministic STL verification algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to showcase the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Provably Correct Automata Embeddings for Optimal Automata-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also two nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D \geq 3d+2$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Quasi-Isometric Reductions Between Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the recursion-theoretic aspects of large-scale geometries of infinite strings, a subject initiated by Khoussainov and Takisaka (2017). We investigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive infinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such reductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically reducible to $\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers an open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of risks, including not only collision risks but also traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in the Carla simulator.</description>

      <title>DeltaProduct: Increasing the Expressivity of DeltaNet Through Products of Householders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</description>
