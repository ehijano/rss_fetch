      <title>Policy Learning with $\alpha$-Expected Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal policy that targets the average welfare of the worst-off $\alpha$-fraction of the post-treatment outcome distribution. We refer to this policy as the $\alpha$-Expected Welfare Maximization ($\alpha$-EWM) rule, where $\alpha \in (0,1]$ denotes the size of the subpopulation of interest. The $\alpha$-EWM rule interpolates between the expected welfare ($\alpha=1$) and the Rawlsian welfare ($\alpha\rightarrow 0$). For $\alpha\in (0,1)$, an $\alpha$-EWM rule can be interpreted as a distributionally robust EWM rule that allows the target population to have a different distribution than the study population. Using the dual formulation of our $\alpha$-expected welfare function, we propose a debiased estimator for the optimal policy and establish its asymptotic upper regret bounds. In addition, we develop asymptotically valid inference for the optimal welfare based on the proposed debiased estimator. We examine the finite sample performance of the debiased estimator and inference via both real and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text, images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions, linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference. We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data, demonstrating the practical value of MARS.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI in Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference on Treatment Effects under Covariate-Adaptive Randomization and Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) frequently utilize covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR) (e.g., stratified block randomization) and commonly suffer from imperfect compliance. This paper studies the identification and inference for the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in such RCTs with a binary treatment.
  We first develop characterizations of the identified sets for both estimands. Since data are generally not i.i.d. under CAR, these characterizations do not follow from existing results. We then provide consistent estimators of the identified sets and asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the parameters. Our asymptotic analysis leads to concrete practical recommendations regarding how to estimate the treatment assignment probabilities that enter the estimated bounds. For the ATE bounds, using sample analog assignment frequencies is more efficient than relying on the true assignment probabilities. For the ATT bounds, the most efficient approach is to use the true assignment probability for the probabilities in the numerator and the sample analog for those in the denominator.</description>

      <title>Large Volatility Matrix Prediction using Tensor Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several approaches for predicting large volatility matrices have been developed based on high-dimensional factor-based It\^o processes. These methods often impose restrictions to reduce the model complexity, such as constant eigenvectors or factor loadings over time. However, several studies indicate that eigenvector processes are also time-varying. To address this feature, this paper generalizes the factor structure by representing the integrated volatility matrix process as a cubic (order-3 tensor) form, which is decomposed into low-rank tensor and idiosyncratic tensor components. To predict conditional expected large volatility matrices, we propose the Projected Tensor Principal Orthogonal componEnt Thresholding (PT-POET) procedure and establish its asymptotic properties. The advantages of PT-POET are validated through a simulation study and demonstrated in an application to minimum variance portfolio allocation using high-frequency trading data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.</description>
