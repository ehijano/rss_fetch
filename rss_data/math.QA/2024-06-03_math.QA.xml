      <title>Bijective solutions to the Pentagon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete classification of all finite bijective set-theoretic solutions $(S,s)$ to the Pentagon Equation is obtained. First, it is shown that every such a solution determines a semigroup structure on the set $S$ that is the direct product $E\times G$ of a semigroup of left zeros $E$ and a group $G$. Next, we prove that this leads to a decomposition of the set $S$ as a Cartesian product $X\times A\times G$, for some sets $X,A$ and to a discovery of a hidden group structure on $A$. Then an unexpected structure of a matched product of groups $A,G$ is found such that the solution $(S,s)$ can be explicitly described as a lift of a solution determined on the set $A\times G$ by this matched product of groups. Conversely, every matched product of groups leads to a family of solutions arising in this way. Moreover, a simple criterion for the isomorphism of two solutions is obtained. The results provide a far reaching extension of the results of Colazzo, Jespers and Kubat, dealing with the special case of the so called involutive solutions. Connections to the solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation and to the theory of skew braces are derived.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Verdier module categories, Frobenius algebras and relative Serre functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of module categories over a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e. a monoidal category with a dualizing object and hence a duality structure more general than rigidity. Such a category C comes with two monoidal structures which are related by non-invertible morphisms and which we treat on an equal footing. Quite generally, non-invertible structure morphisms play a dominant role in this theory.
  In any Grothendieck-Verdier module category M we find two important subcategories M' and M''. The internal End of an object in M' that is a C-generator is an algebra such that its category of modules is equivalent to M as a module category. We also introduce a partially defined relative Serre functor S which furnishes an equivalence between M' and M''. Any isomorphism between an object m of M' and S(m) in M'' endows the internal End of m with the structure of a Grothendieck-Verdier Frobenius algebra.</description>

      <title>Reflections to set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to determine reflections to bijective and non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, by exploring their connections with their derived solutions. This is motivated by a recent description of left non-degenerate solutions in terms of a family of automorphisms of their associated left rack. In some cases, we show that the study of reflections for bijective and non-degenerate solutions can be reduced to those of derived type. Moreover, we extend some results obtained in the literature for reflections of involutive non-degenerate solutions to more arbitrary solutions. Besides, we provide ways for defining reflections for solutions obtained by employing some classical construction techniques of solutions. Finally, we gather some numerical data on reflections for bijective non-degenerate solutions associated with skew braces of small order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory and Application of Contextual Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has fueled machine learning (ML) across many domains. When paired data measurements $(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$ are coupled to covariates, a challenging conditional distribution learning setting arises. Existing approaches for learning a $\textit{global}$ transport map parameterized through a potentially unseen context utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenier's theorem. Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus unravelling a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method (QontOT) on synthetic and real data by predicting variations in cell type distributions conditioned on drug dosage. Importantly we conduct a 24-qubit hardware experiment on a task challenging for classical computers and report a performance that cannot be matched with our classical neural OT approach. In sum, this is a first step toward learning to predict contextualized transportation plans through quantum computing.</description>
