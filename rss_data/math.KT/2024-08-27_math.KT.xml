      <title>On the Hochschild Homology of Curved Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hochschild homology of the differential graded category of perfect curved modules over suitable curved rings, giving what might be termed "de Rham models" for such. This represents a generalization of previous results by Dyckerhoff, Efimov, Polishchuk, and Positselski concerning the Hochschild homology of matrix factorizations. A key ingredient in the proof is a theorem due to B. Briggs, which represents a "curved version" of a celebrated theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. The proof of Briggs' Theorem is included in an appendix to this paper.</description>

      <title>Conditional representation stability, classification of $*$-homomorphisms, and eta invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-representation of a group is a map from the group into a matrix algebra (or similar object) that approximately satisfies the relations needed to be a representation. Work of many people starting with Kazhdan and Voiculescu, and recently advanced by Dadarlat, Eilers-Shulman-S\o{}rensen and others, has shown that there are topological obstructions to approximating unitary quasi-representations of groups by honest representations, where `approximation' is understood to be with respect to the operator norm.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore whether approximation is possible if the known obstructions vanish, partially generalizing work of Gong-Lin and Eilers-Loring-Pedersen for the free abelian group of rank two, and the Klein bottle group. We show that this is possible, at least in a weak sense, for some `low-dimensional' groups including fundamental groups of closed surfaces, certain Baumslag-Solitar groups, free-by-cyclic groups, and many fundamental groups of three manifolds.
  The techniques used in the paper are $K$-theoretic: they have their origin in Baum-Connes-Kasparov type assembly maps, and in the Elliott program to classify $C^*$-algebras; Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory is a crucial tool. The key new technical ingredients are: a stable uniqueness theorem in the sense of Dadarlat-Eilers and Lin that works for non-exact $C^*$-algebras; and an analysis of maps on $K$-theory with finite coefficients in terms of the relative eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. Despite the proofs going through $K$-theoretic machinery, the main theorems can be stated in elementary terms that do not need any $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} complete toric variety. We further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>Scissors automorphism groups and their homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any category with a reasonable notion of cover, each object has a group of scissors automorphisms. We prove that under mild conditions, the homology of this group is independent of the object, and can be expressed in terms of the scissors congruence K-theory spectrum defined by Zakharevich. We therefore obtain both a group-theoretic interpretation of Zakharevich's higher scissors congruence K-theory, as well as a method to compute the homology of scissors automorphism groups. We apply this to various families of groups, such as interval exchange groups and Brin--Thompson groups, recovering results of Szymik--Wahl, Li, and Tanner, and obtaining new results as well.</description>

      <title>Controlled KK-theory, and a Milnor exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce controlled $KK$-theory groups associated to a pair $(A,B)$ of separable $C^*$-algebras. Roughly, these consist of elements of the usual $K$-theory group $K_0(B)$ that approximately commute with elements of $A$. Our main results show that these groups are related to Kasparov's $KK$-groups by a Milnor exact sequence, in such a way that R\o{}rdam's $KL$-group is identified with an inverse limit of our controlled $KK$-groups.
  In the case that the $C^*$-algebras involved satisfy the UCT, our Milnor exact sequence agrees with the Milnor sequence associated to a $KK$-filtration in the sense of Schochet, although our results are independent of the UCT. Applications to the UCT will be pursued in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>On higher scissors congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the higher version of Hilbert's Third Problem for one-dimensional geometries, and in higher dimensions we reduce the problem to a computation in group homology. Our central result concerns the scissors congruence $K$-theory spectrum of Zakharevich, whose homotopy groups are the correct higher version of the classical scissors congruence groups. We prove that this spectrum is a Thom spectrum, whose base space is the homotopy orbit space of a Tits complex. The relevant computations quickly follow from this more foundational result.</description>
