      <title>EEvA: Fast Expert-Based Algorithms for Buffer Page Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal page replacement is an important problem in efficient buffer management. The range of replacement strategies known in the literature varies from simple but efficient FIFO-based algorithms to more accurate but potentially costly methods tailored to specific data access patterns. The principal issue in adopting a pattern-specific replacement logic in a DB buffer manager is to guarantee non-degradation in general high-load regimes. In this paper, we propose a new family of page replacement algorithms for DB buffer manager which demonstrate a superior performance wrt competitors on custom data access patterns and imply a low computational overhead on TPC-C. We provide theoretical foundations and an extensive experimental study on the proposed algorithms which covers synthetic benchmarks and an implementation in an open-source DB kernel evaluated on TPC-C.</description>

      <title>ChatBI: Towards Natural Language to Complex Business Intelligence SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems. Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task. First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations. The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult. ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns. The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.
  We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</description>

      <title>Powering In-Database Dynamic Model Slicing for Structured Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are widely used for the storage and retrieval of structured data. To derive insights beyond statistical aggregation, we typically have to extract specific subdatasets from the database using conventional database operations, and then apply deep neural networks (DNN) training and inference on these respective subdatasets in a separate machine learning system. The process can be prohibitively expensive, especially when there are a combinatorial number of subdatasets extracted for different analytical purposes. This calls for efficient in-database support of advanced analytical methods In this paper, we introduce LEADS, a novel SQL-aware dynamic model slicing technique to customize models for subdatasets specified by SQL queries. LEADS improves the predictive modeling of structured data via the mixture of experts (MoE) technique and maintains inference efficiency by a SQL-aware gating network. At the core of LEADS is the construction of a general model with multiple expert sub-models via MoE trained over the entire database. This SQL-aware MoE technique scales up the modeling capacity, enhances effectiveness, and preserves efficiency by activating only necessary experts via the gating network during inference. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms during the training process of LEADS to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency. We also design and build an in-database inference system, called INDICES, to support end-to-end advanced structured data analytics by non-intrusively incorporating LEADS onto PostgreSQL. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LEADS consistently outperforms baseline models, and INDICES delivers effective in-database analytics with a considerable reduction in inference latency compared to traditional solutions.</description>

      <title>Credentials in the Occupation Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term credential encompasses educational certificates, degrees, certifications, and government-issued licenses. An occupational credential is a verification of an individuals qualification or competence issued by a third party with relevant authority. Job seekers often leverage such credentials as evidence that desired qualifications are satisfied by their holders. Many U.S. education and workforce development organizations have recognized the importance of credentials for employment and the challenges of understanding the value of credentials. In this study, we identified and ontologically defined credential and credential-related terms at the textual and semantic levels based on the Occupation Ontology (OccO), a BFO-based ontology. Different credential types and their authorization logic are modeled. We additionally defined a high-level hierarchy of credential related terms and relations among many terms, which were initiated in concert with the Alabama Talent Triad (ATT) program, which aims to connect learners, earners, employers and education/training providers through credentials and skills. To our knowledge, our research provides for the first time systematic ontological modeling of the important domain of credentials and related contents, supporting enhanced credential data and knowledge integration in the future.</description>

      <title>Grounding Realizable Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontological representations of qualities, dispositions, and roles have been refined over the past decade, clarifying subtle distinctions in life science research. After articulating a widely-used characterization of these entities within the context of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), we identify gaps in this treatment and motivate the need for supplementing the BFO characterization. By way of supplement, we propose definitions for grounding relations holding between qualities and dispositions, and dispositions and roles, illustrating our proposal by representing subtle aspects of host-pathogen interactions.</description>

      <title>Raster Interval Object Approximations for Spatial Intersection Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial join processing techniques that identify intersections between complex geometries (e.g.,polygons) commonly follow a two-step filter-and-refine pipeline; the filter step evaluates the query predicate on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of objects and the refinement step eliminates false positives by applying the query on the exact geometries. We propose a raster intervals approximation of object geometries and introduce a powerful intermediate step in pipeline. In a preprocessing phase, our method (i) rasterizes each object geometry using a fine grid, (ii) models groups of nearby cells that intersect the polygon as an interval, and (iii) encodes each interval by a bitstring that captures the overlap of each cell in it with the polygon. Going one step further, we improve our approach to approximate each object by two sets of intervals that succintly capture the raster cells which (i) intersect with the object and (ii) are fully contained in the object. Using this representation, we show that we can verify whether two polygons intersect by a sequence of joins between the interval sets that take linear time. Our approximations can effectively be compressed and can be customized for use on partitioned data and polygons of varying sizes, rasterized at different granularities. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the interval approximation of a polygon without fully rasterizing it first, rendering the computation of approximations orders of magnitude faster. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal over previous work.</description>

      <title>A Universal Scheme for Dynamic Partitioned Shortest Path Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortest path (SP) computation is the fundamental operation in various networks such as urban networks, logistic networks, communication networks, social networks, etc. With the development of technology and societal expansions, those networks tend to be massive. This, in turn, causes deteriorated performance of SP computation, and graph partitioning is commonly leveraged to scale up the SP algorithms. However, the partitioned shortest path (PSP) index has never been systematically investigated and theoretically analyzed, and there is a lack of experimental comparison among different PSP indexes. Moreover, few studies have explored PSP index maintenance in dynamic networks. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically analyze the dynamic PSP index by proposing a universal scheme for it. Specifically, we first propose two novel partitioned shortest path strategies (No-boundary and Post-boundary strategies) to improve the performance of PSP indexes and design the corresponding index maintenance approaches to deal with dynamic scenarios. Then we categorize the partition methods from the perspective of partition structure to facilitate the selection of partition methods in the PSP index. Furthermore, we propose a universal scheme for designing the PSP index by coupling its three dimensions (i.e. PSP strategy, partition structure, and SP algorithm). Based on this scheme, we propose five new PSP indexes with prominent performance in either query or update efficiency. Lastly, extensive experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSP scheme, with valuable guidance provided on the PSP index design.</description>
