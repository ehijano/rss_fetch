      <title>Relationship Between Leisure Activities, Stress Management Methods, Study Methods, and Methods of Learning New Things Among First-Year Statistics Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between leisure activities, stress management methods, studying methods, and methods of learning new things is crucial and affects performance in all aspects of life. On the other hand, data science and statistics are rapidly growing fields with high demands across universities. Thus, this study aimed to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between the four dimensions: leisure activities, stress management methods, studying methods and methods of learning new things. The participants of this study were first-year undergraduates studying statistics at one of the universities in Sri Lanka. There were 117 students in the sample (female-65, male-52). A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data. First, individual responses for each question under each dimension were visualized using tile maps separately for males and females to identify similarities and dissimilarities in responses. Next, individuals were clustered based on the responses for each dimension separately. Finally, all resulting clusters were re-clustered to identify the relationships between the dimensions. In all cluster analyses, we used Jaccard distance with hierarchical clustering using the complete linkage method. The results were visualized using tile maps. Across all four dimensions we considered, the top activities were either listening to music or lectures and watching videos or TV shows, suggesting that individuals are introverts and passive learners. There was no strong relationship between these dimensions. By identifying these clusters and relationships, educators can tailor instructional approaches to enhance engagement and effectiveness in diverse learning environments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Functional Derivatives in Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probability generating functionals (PGFLs) are efficient and powerful tools for tracking independent objects in clutter. It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</description>
