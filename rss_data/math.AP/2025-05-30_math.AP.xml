      <title>Second boundary value problem for the Hessian curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of strictly convex hypersurfaces driven by the $k$-Hessian curvature flow, subject to the second boundary condition. We first explore the translating solutions corresponding to this boundary value problem. Next, we establish the long-time existence of the flow and prove that it converges to a translating solution. To overcome the difficulty of driving boundary $C^2$ estimates, we employ an orthogonal invariance technique. Using this method, we extend the results of Schn\"urer-Smoczyk \cite{Schnurer2003} and Schn\"urer \cite{Schnurer2002} from the second boundary value problem of Gauss curvature flow to $k$-Hessian curvature flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large time behavior of solutions to the system of equations describing motion of compressible viscoelastic fluids. We focus on the linearized system around a motionless state in a three-dimensional exterior domain and derive the local energy decay estimate of its solution to give the diffusion wave phenomena caused by sound wave viscous diffusion and elastic shear wave.</description>

      <title>Brakke inequality and the existence of Brakke-flow for volume preserving mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new notion of Brakke inequality for volume preserving mean curvature flow. We show the existence of integral varifolds solving the flow globally-in-time in the corresponding Brakke sense using the phase field method. Morever, such varifolds are solutions to volume preserving mean curvature flow in the $L^2$-flow sense as well. We thus extend a previous result by one of the authors [25].</description>

      <title>Two phase micropolar fluid flow with unmatched densities modeled by Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard systems: Local strong well-posedness and consistency estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a thermodynamically consistent phase field model for binary mixtures of micropolar fluids, i.e., fluids exhibiting internal rotations. Furnishing with classical no-slip, no-spin and no-flux boundary conditions, in a smooth and bounded three-dimensional domain, we establish the well-posedness of local-in-time strong solutions. Since the model studied is a generalization of the earlier model introduced by Abels, Garcke and Gr\"un for binary Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities, we provide a consistency result between the corresponding strong solutions to both models in terms of a parameter associated to the micro-rotation viscosity.</description>

      <title>On low regularity well-posedness of the binormal flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a class of solutions of the binormal flow, model of the evolution of vortex filaments, that generate several corner singularities in finite time. This phenomenon has been studied earlier in the regular case, which in this context is in terms of the summability of the angles of the corners generated. Our goal here is to investigate the lower regularity case, using further the Hasimoto approach that allows to use the 1D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger to study the binormal flow. We first obtain a deterministic result by proving an existence result for general binormal flow solutions at low regularity. Then we obtain improved results on the above class of solutions by a suitable randomization of the curvature and torsion of the vortex filament. To do so, we prove a scattering result for a quasi-invariance measure associated with a suitable 1D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that we consider of independent interest. An interesting feature of this result is that we are able to identify a limit measure, which is usually not possible when working on quasi-invariant Gaussian measures for Hamiltonian PDEs on bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity for the nonlocal $(1, p)$-Laplace equations in the superquadratic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interior Sobolev regularity of weak solutions to the nonlocal $(1, p)$-Laplace equations in the superquadratic case $p\ge 2$. As a product, the explicit H\"{o}lder continuity estimates of weak solutions are derived. The proof relies on a detailed analysis of the structural characteristics of $(1, p)$-growth in the nonlocal setting, combined with the finite difference quotient method, tail estimates, refined energy estimates, and a Moser-type iteration scheme.</description>

      <title>The boundary control approach to inverse spectral theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish connections between different approaches to inverse spectral problems: the classical Gelfand--Levitan theory, the Krein method, the Simon theory, the approach proposed by Remling and the Boundary Control method. We show that the Boundary Control approach provides simple and physically motivated proofs of the central results of other theories. We demonstrate also the connections between the dynamical and spectral data and derive the local version of the classical Gelfand--Levitan equations.</description>

Abstract: We link the Boundary Control Theory and the Titchmarsh-Weyl Theory. This provides a natural interpretation of the $A-$amplitude due to Simon and yields a new efficient method to evaluate the Titchmarsh-Weyl $m-$function associated with the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H=-\partial _{x}^{2}+q\left( x\right) $ on $L_{2}\left( 0,\infty \right) $ with Dirichlet boundary condition at $x=0.$</description>

      <title>Rigidity and functional properties of $\mathrm{BD}_{dev}(\Omega)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a structural analysis of the space of functions of bounded deviatoric deformation, $\mathrm{BD}_{dev}$, which arises in models of plasticity and fluid mechanics. The main result is the identification of the annihilator and a rigidity theorem for $\mathrm{BD}_{dev}$-maps with constant polar vector in the wave cone characterizing the structure of singularities for such maps. This result, together with an explicit kernel projection operator, enables an iterative blow-up procedure for relaxation and homogenization problems, allowing for integrands with explicit dependence on $u$ as well as $\mathcal{E}_d u$. Our approach overcomes several difficulties as compared to the $\mathrm{BD}$ case, in particular due to the lack of invariance of $\mathcal{E}_d$ under orthogonalization of the polar directions. Applications to integral representation and Material science are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hessian operators, overdetermined problems, and higher order mean curvatures: symmetry and stability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a deep connection between Serrin's symmetry result -- dealing with overdetermined problems involving the Laplacian -- and the celebrated Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem (SBT) -- stating that, if the mean curvature $H$ of the boundary of a smooth bounded connected open set $\Om$ is constant, then $\Om$ must be a ball. One of the main aims of the paper is to extend the study of such a connection to the broader case of overdetermined problems for Hessian operators and constant higher order mean curvature boundaries. Our analysis will not only provide new proofs of the higher order SBT (originally established by Alexandrov) and of the symmetry for overdetermined Serrin-type problems for Hessian equations (originally established by Brandolini, Nitsch, Salani, and Trombetti), but also bring several benefits, including new interesting symmetry results and quantitative stability estimates.
  In fact, leveraging the analysis performed in the classical case (i.e., with classical mean curvature and classical Laplacian) by Magnanini and Poggesi in a series of papers, we will extend their approach to the higher order setting (i.e., with $k$-order mean curvature and $k$-Hessian operator, for $k \ge 1$) achieving various quantitative estimates of closeness to the symmetric configuration. Finally, leveraging the quantitative analysis in presence of bubbling phenomena performed in arXiv:2405.06376, we also provide a quantitative stability result of closeness of almost constant $k$-mean curvature boundaries to a set given by the union of a finite number of disjoint balls of equal radii. In passing, we will also provide two alternative proofs of the result established by Brandolini, Nitsch, Salani, and Trombetti, one of which provides the extension to Hessian operators of the approach famously pioneered by Weinberger for the classical Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Fluid Echoes and Sobolev Stability Threshold for 2D Dissipative Fluid Equations Around Couette Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Sobolev stability thresholds of 2d dissipative fluid equations around Couette flow on the domain $\mathbb T\times \mathbb R$. We prove a bound for general nonlinear interactions, which, for several fluid equations, reduces the proof of nonlinear stability to a linear stability analysis. We apply this approach to the examples of Navier-Stokes, Boussinesq and magnetohydrodynamic equations around Couette flow. This improves the Sobolev stability threshold for the Boussinesq equations around Couette flow and large affine temperature to $1/3$ and for the MHD equations around Couette flow and constant magnetic field to $1/3^+$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel idea to study $y$-dependence for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}^n$. Unlike \cite{STNT2014}(Analysis \&amp; PDE, 2014) and \cite{HHYL2024}(SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2024), the heart of the matter is that the scaling argument is invalid. Moreover, we also consider the Cauchy problem, which transforms the variational analysis into dynamical stability results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Strong Unique Continuation Property (SUCP) for elliptic equations with piecewise Lipschitz coefficients exhibiting jump discontinuities across a regular interface. We prove SUCP at the interface using a doubling inequality derived from a Carleman estimate with a singular weight. This result is intended as a first step toward solving the inverse problem of estimating the size of an unknown, merely measurable, inclusion inside a conductor from boundary measurements.</description>

      <title>Layer potentials for elliptic operators with DMO-type coefficients: big pieces $Tb$ theorem, quantitative rectifiability, and free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n \geq 2$, we consider the operator $L_A = -\mathrm{div }(A(\cdot)\nabla)$, where $A$ is a uniformly elliptic $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrix with variable coefficients, a Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and the associated gradient of the single layer potential operator $T_\mu$. Under a Dini-type assumption on the mean oscillation of the matrix $A$, we establish the following results:
  1) A rectifiability criterion for $\mu$ in terms of $T_\mu$. Under quantitative geometric and analytic assumptions within a ball $B$ -- including an upper $n$-growth condition on $\mu$ in $B$, a thin boundary condition, a scale-invariant decay condition expressed via a weighted sum of densities over dyadic dilations of $B$, and $L^2$ boundedness of the gradient of $T_\mu$ -- we show the following: if the support of $\mu$ lies very close to an $n$-plane in $B$, and $T_\mu 1$ is nearly constant on $B$ in the $L^2$ sense, then there exists a uniformly $n$-rectifiable set $\Gamma$ such that $\mu(B \cap \Gamma) \gtrsim \mu(B)$.
  2) A $Tb$ theorem for suppressed $T_\mu$, which extends a well-known theorem of Nazarov, Treil, and Volberg, and holds also for a broader class of singular integral operators.
  These results make it possible to prove both qualitative and quantitative one- and two-phase free boundary problems for elliptic measure, formulated in terms of (uniform) rectifiability, in bounded Wiener-regular domains.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to a full compressible magnetohydrodynamic flow interacting with thermoelastic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an interaction problem between a full compressible, electrically conducting fluid and a thermoelastic shell in a two-dimensional setting. The shell is modelled by linear thermoelasticity equations, and encompasses a time-dependent domain which is filled with a fluid described by full compressible (non-resistive) magnetohydrodynamic equations. The magnetohydrodynamic flow and the shell are fully coupled, resulting in a fluid-structure interaction problem that involves heat exchange. We establish the existence of weak solutions through domain extension, operator splitting, decoupling, penalization of the interface condition, and appropriate limit passages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a reduced one-dimensional moving boundary model is studied that describes the evolution of a biofilm driven by the presence of a reaction limiting substrate. Global well-posedness is established for the resulting parabolic free boundary value problem in strong form in Sobolev spaces and for a quasi-stationary approximation in spaces of classical regularity. The general existence results are complemented by results about the qualitative properties of solutions including the existence, in general, and, additionally, the uniqueness and stability of non-trivial equilibria, in a special case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the asymptotic behavior of large solutions for a quasi-linear equation involving the p-Laplacian, defined on a sequence of finite cylindrical domains converging to an infinite cylinder. We demonstrate that the sequence of solutions converges locally, in the Sobolev norm, to a solution of the corresponding cross-sectional problem. Moreover, we establish a convergence rate. As part of our analysis, we extend existing convergence results for the case $p\geq 2$, which previously lacked explicit convergence rates, to the range $1&lt;p&lt;2$. We additionally address solutions with finite Dirichlet boundary data within a unified framework and exhibit that this rate of convergence is independent of the boundary data.</description>

      <title>Complex Band Structure and localisation transition for tridiagonal non-Hermitian k-Toeplitz operators with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Bloch-Floquet theory, we propose an innovative technique to obtain the eigenvectors of tridiagonal k-Toeplitz operators. This method offers a more extensive and quantitative basis for describing localised eigenvectors beyond the non-trivial winding zone, yielding sharp decay bounds. The validity of our results is confirmed numerically in one-dimensional resonator chains, showcasing non-Hermitian skin localisation, bulk localisation, and tunnelling effects. We conclude the paper by analysing non-Hermitian tight binding Hamiltonians, illustrating the broad applicability of the complex band structure.</description>

      <title>Quadratic convergence of an SQP method for some optimization problems with applications to control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a sequential quadratic programming algorithm for solving a class of abstract optimization problems. Assuming that the initial point is in an $L^2$ neighborhood of a local solution that satisfies no-gap second-order sufficient optimality conditions and a strict complementarity condition, we obtain stability and quadratic convergence in $L^q$ for all $q\in[p,\infty]$ where $p\geq 2$ depends on the problem. Many of the usual optimal control problems of partial differential equations fit into this abstract formulation. Some examples are given in the paper. Finally, a computational comparison with other versions of the SQP method is presented.</description>

      <title>The second order Huang-Yang approximation to the Fermi thermodynamic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute Fermi gas in the thermodynamic limit with interaction potential scattering length $\mathfrak{a}_0$ at temperature $T&gt;0$. We prove the 2nd order Huang-Yang approximation for the Fermi pressure of the system, in which there is a 2nd order term carrying the positive temperature efffect.Our formula is valid up to the temperature $T&lt;\rho^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}$, which is, by scaling, also necessary for the Huang-Yang formula to hold. Here, $T_F\sim\rho^{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the Fermi temperature. We also establish during the course of the proof, a conjecture regarding the second order approximation of density $\rho$ by R. Seiringer \cite{FermithermoTpositive}. Our proof uses frequency localization techniques from the analysis of nonlinear PDEs and does not involve spatial localization or Bosonization. In particular, our method covers the classical Huang-Yang formula at zero temperature.</description>

Abstract: We present three equivalent definitions of the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}^{n}})^{s}_{p}$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $p&gt;1$, with normalizing constants, on hyperbolic spaces. The explicit values of the constants enable us to study the convergence of the fractional $p$-Laplacian to the $p$-Laplacian as $s \to 1^{-}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the gradient flow structure of the porous medium equations with non-negative constant Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct weak solutions to the equations via the minimizing movement scheme by considering an entropy functional with respect to $Wb_2$ distance, which is a modified Wasserstein distance introduced by Figalli and Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107-130]. Furthermore, the constructed solutions are characterized as curves of maximal slope in a suitable sense.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantitative analysis of bubbling phenomena for almost constant mean curvature boundaries is an important question having significant applications in various fields including capillarity theory and the study of mean curvature flows. Such a quantitative analysis was initiated in [G. Ciraolo and F. Maggi, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (2017)], where the first quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii was obtained in terms of a uniform deviation of the mean curvature from being constant. Weakening the measure of the deviation in such a result is a delicate issue that is crucial in view of the applications for mean curvature flows. Some progress in this direction was recently made in [V. Julin and J. Niinikoski, Anal. PDE (2023)], where $L^{N-1}$-deviations are considered for domains in $\mathbb{R}^N$. In the present paper we significantly weaken the measure of the deviation, obtaining a quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii for the following deviation $$ \int_{\partial \Omega } \left( H_0 - H \right)^+ dS_x, \quad \text{ where } \begin{cases} H \text{ is the mean curvature of } \partial \Omega , \\ H_0:=\frac{| \partial \Omega |}{N | \Omega |} , \\ \left( H_0 - H \right)^+:=\max\left\lbrace H_0 - H , 0 \right\rbrace , \end{cases} $$ which is clearly even weaker than $\Vert H_0-H \Vert_{L^1( \partial \Omega )}$.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies solutions to a singular $SU(3)$ Toda system with linear source terms on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with smooth boundaries $\partial\Sigma$. We establish the existence of solutions when the parameters are not critical, assuming that Euler characteristic $\chi(\Sigma)&lt;1$ via analyzing the sublevels. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition that ensures multiple solutions for generic potentials by Morse inequalities and a transversality theorem.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient.
  The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.</description>

Moreover, we identify their growth of order at least $(2-1/k)$ in $n/k$. In the case $k=n$, we show that the Monge--Amp\`ere eigenvalues of the unit balls tend to $4$ in the large dimension limit.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and interpolation of manifolds II: Inverse problems with partial data for distances observations and for the heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ and its metric tensor $g$ can be approximately reconstructed from local distance measurements. Moreover, we consider an inverse problem of determining $(M,g)$ from limited knowledge on the heat kernel. In the part 1 of the paper, we considered the approximate construction of a smooth manifold in the case when one is given the noisy distances $\tilde d(x,y)=d(x,y)+\varepsilon_{x,y}$ for all points $x,y\in X$, where $X$ is a $\delta$-dense subset of $M$ and $|\varepsilon_{x,y}|&lt;\delta$. In this part 2 of the paper, we consider a similar problem with partial data, that is, the approximate construction of the manifold $(M,g)$ when we are given $\tilde d(x,y)$ for $x\in X$ and $y \in U\cap X$, where $U$ is an open subset of $M$. In addition, we consider the inverse problem of determining the manifold $(M,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature from noisy observations of the heat kernel $G(y,z,t)$. We show that a manifold approximating $(M,g)$ can be determined in a stable way, when for some unknown source points $z_j$ in $X\setminus U$, we are given the values of the heat kernel $G(y,z_k,t)$ for $y\in X\cap U$ and $t\in (0,1)$ with a multiplicative noise. We also give a uniqueness result for the inverse problem in the case when the data does not contain noise and consider applications in manifold learning. A novel feature of the inverse problem for the heat kernel is that the set $M\setminus U$ containing the sources and the observation set $U$ are disjoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear \blue{time-dependent} partial differential equations (PDEs). In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of the fidelity coefficient in a Cahn-Hilliard image inpainting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inpainting model proposed by A. Bertozzi et al., which is based on a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation. This equation describes the evolution of an order parameter that represents an approximation of the original image occupying a bounded two-dimensional domain. The given image is assumed to be damaged in a fixed subdomain, and the equation is characterised by a linear reaction term. This term is multiplied by the so-called fidelity coefficient, which is a strictly positive bounded function defined in the undamaged region. The idea is that, given an initial image, the order parameter evolves towards the given image, and this process properly diffuses through the boundary of the damaged region, restoring the damaged image, provided that the fidelity coefficient is large enough. Here, we formulate an optimal control problem based on this fact, namely, our cost functional accounts for the magnitude of the fidelity coefficient. Assuming a singular potential to ensure that the order parameter takes its values in between 0 and 1, we first analyse the control-to-state operator and prove the existence of at least one optimal control, establishing the validity of first-order optimality conditions. Then, under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate second-order optimality conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of the curl operator on a generic smoothly bounded domain in three-dimensional Euclidean space consists of simple eigenvalues. The main new ingredient in our proof is a formula for the variation of curl eigenvalues under a perturbation of the domain, reminiscent of Hadamard's formula for the variation of Laplace eigenvalues under Dirichlet boundary conditions. As another application of this variational formula, we simplify the derivation of a well-known necessary condition for a domain to minimize the first curl eigenvalue functional among domains of a given volume and derive similar necessary conditions for a domain extremizing higher eigenvalue functionals.</description>
