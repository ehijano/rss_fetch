      <title>Computational generation of tailored radionuclide libraries for alpha-particle and gamma-ray spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radionuclide identification is a radioanalytical method employed in various scientific disciplines that utilize alpha-particle or gamma-ray spectrometric assays, ranging from astrophysics to nuclear medicine. Radionuclide libraries in conventional radionuclide identification systems are crafted in a manual fashion, accompanying labor-intensive and error-prone user tasks and hindering library customization. This research presents a computational algorithm and the architecture of its dedicated software that can automatically generate tailored radionuclide libraries. Progenitor-progeny recurrence relations were modeled to enable recursive computation of radionuclide subsets. This theoretical concept was incorporated into open-source software called RecurLib and validated against four actinide decay series and twelve radioactive substances, including a uranium-glazed legacy Fiestaware, natural uranium and thorium sources, a $^{226}$Ra sample, and the medical radionuclides $^{225}$Ac, $^{177}$Lu, and $^{99\text{m}}$Tc. The developed algorithm yielded radionuclide libraries for all the tested specimens within minutes, demonstrating its efficiency and applicability across diverse scenarios. The proposed approach introduces a framework for computerized radionuclide library generation, thereby trivializing library-driven radionuclide identification and facilitating the spectral recognition of unregistered radionuclides in radiation spectrometry.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before.</description>

      <title>Study of the Coulomb and nuclear breakup of $^{11}$Be using a Halo-EFT description at N$^2$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) provides a very efficient description of loosely-bound nuclei in models of reaction. It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed.</description>

      <title>New insights on fission of $^{235}$U induced by high energy neutrons from a new measurement at CERN n\_TOF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction cross section was measured relative to neutron-proton elastic scattering for the first time in the energy region from 10 MeV to 440 MeV at the CERN n\_TOF facility, extending the upper limit of the only previous measurement in the literature by more than 200 MeV. Two independent detection systems were used simultaneously to extract the fission cross section. For neutron energies below 200 MeV, the present results agree within one standard deviation with the data available in literature and are well reproduced by the IAEA evaluation. Above 200 MeV, the comparison of model calculations to the present data indicates the need to introduce a transient time in the description of the neutron-induced fission process in order to allow the simultaneous description of (n,f) and (p,f) reactions.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction matching for solving quantum many-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations play an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions to quantum chemistry and from atomic and molecular systems to nuclear physics. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing a new approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Momentum Broadening in a Non-Abelian Plasma away from Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform classical-statistical real-time lattice simulations to compute real-time spectral functions and momentum broadening of quarks in the presence of strongly populated non-Abelian gauge fields. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, we find that the momentum distribution of quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features as a function of time due to correlated momentum kicks it receives from the medium, eventually going over to a diffusive regime. We extract the momentum diffusion coefficient for a mass range describing charm and bottom quarks and find sizeable discrepancies from the heavy quark limit.</description>

      <title>Isotope-shift analysis with the $4f^{14}6s^{2}~^1S_0- 4f^{13}5d6s^{2}(J=2)$ transition in ytterbium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of isotope shifts have recently been attracting considerable attention due to their potentials in searching for new forces. We report on the isotope shifts of the $4f^{14}6s^{2}~^1S_0- 4f^{13}5d6s^{2}(J=2)$ transition at 431 nm in Yb, based on absolute frequency measurements with an accuracy of $\sim10$ kHz. With these data, the hyperfine constants for $^{173}$Yb are determined. To analyze these data further, electronic structure of ytterbium is theoretically calculated. The nuclear charge radii are estimated together with some previously reported isotope-shift data for other transitions. An analysis of the King plot for the $4f^{14}6s^{2}~^1S_0- 4f^{13}5d6s^{2}(J=2)$ transition shows a good consistency with other transitions, resulting in a constraint on the existence of new bosons mediating the force between an electron and a neutron. The analysis motivates further precision measurements on isotope shifts of the narrow-linewidth transitions in ytterbium, not only for the even-mass isotopes but also for the odd-mass isotopes.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central nucleus--nucleus as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>
