      <title>Towards Real-Time Interpolation for Enhanced AUV Deep Sea Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately seventy-one percent of the Earth is covered in water. Of that area, ninety-five percent of the ocean has never been explored or mapped. There are several engineering challenges that have prevented the exploration of the deep ocean through human or autonomous means. These challenges include but are not limited to high pressure, cold temperatures, little natural light, corrosion of materials, and communication. Ongoing research has been focused on trying to find optimal and low-cost solutions to effective communication between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the surface or air. In this paper, an architecture is introduced that utilizes an edge computing approach to establish computation nearer to the source of data, allowing further exploration of the deep ocean. Taking the most common interpolation techniques used today in the field of bathymetry, the data are tested and analyzed to find the feasibility of switching from CPU to GPU computation. Specifically, the focus is on writing efficient interpolation algorithms that can be run on low-level GPUs, which can be carried onboard AUVs as payload.</description>

      <title>Unravelling how winds and surface heat fluxes control the Atlantic Oceans meridional heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The North Atlantic Ocean circulation, fuelled by winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, carries 1.25 PettaWatts of heat poleward in the subtropics, and helps in regulating global weather and climate patterns. Here, we assess the relative impacts of changes in winds and surface heat fluxes on the Atlantic Ocean circulation and heat transport on short timescales (&lt;10 years) and long timescales (&gt;50 years) using ocean simulations. We decompose the circulation and heat transport into warm and cold cells (resembling a subtropical gyre and the dense overturning circulation respectively), and a mixed cell capturing waters transitioning between warm and cold regions. Warm and mixed cells transport more heat poleward as wind stress increases; however, these anomalies are compensated by reductions in the cold cell's heat transport. Warm and cold cells transport more heat poleward when we increase meridional heat flux gradients. Our findings underscore the distinct roles of winds and surface heat fluxes in controlling the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport.</description>
