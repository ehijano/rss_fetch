      <title>The Quantum Master and its Classical Emissary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ian McGilchrist's works present the thesis that the two hemispheres of the brain have radically different modes of interacting with the world, and that their respective perceptions and functions must be properly integrated for a viable way forward. This proper integration requires restoring the right-brain to its proper place as "Master." I discuss a parallel to this insight in the dichotomous "worlds" of quantum and classical physics. In addition, I discuss the relevance of Whitehead's process philosophy, as well as the Taoist concepts of Yin and Yang, with particular attention to the importance and primacy of Yin underlying the quantum level as "Master."</description>

      <title>Implications of Tarski's Undefinability Theorem on the Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Theory of Everything ($S_{\text{ToE}}$) seeks to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including quantum gravity, into a single theoretical framework. This theory would be defined internally using a set of axioms, and this paper proposes a set of axioms for any such theory. Furthermore, for such a theory, all scientific truth would be defined internally as consequences derivable from the rules of such a theory. This paper then examines the implications of Tarski's undefinability theorem on scientific truths derived from such axioms. We demonstrate that Tarski's theorem imposes limitations on any such formal system $S_{\text{ToE}}$. However, we also argue that the Lucas-Penrose argument suggests that non-algorithmic understanding can transcend these formal limitations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of growth and convergence of all physical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper limit on what is computable in our universe is unknown, but widely believed to be set by the Turing machine -- with a function being physically computable if and only if it is Turing-computable. I show how this apparently mild assumption leads to generous yet binding limits on how quickly or slowly any directly measurable physical phenomenon can grow or converge -- limits that are intimately connected to Rado's Busy Beaver function. I conjecture that these limits are novel physical laws governing which rates of growth and convergence are possible in our universe.</description>

      <title>Birth and ephemeral life of pseudopotential alchemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of band offsets at semiconductor interfaces has been one of Alfonso Baldereschi most cherished topics, to which he has made significant contributions, both directly and by enticing peers and disciples, including myself, to delve deeply into it. In this tribute, I recount how a brilliant idea of his for modeling band offsets in a class of semiconductor heterojunctions led to one of our most cited works and brought about the birth of pseudopotential alchemy. This model provides a powerful tool to both compute and fathom the electronic and structural properties of composite semiconductors, such as heterojunctions and alloys, by treating them as small perturbations with respect to a virtual crystal, a system in which different chemical elements occupying crystallographically equivalent lattice sites are represented by an average pseudopotential. This note is intended as a tribute to the fond memories I have of the time spent with, and the science learned from, Alfonso. No attempt will be made at bibliographic completeness in the niche field of pseudopotential alchemy, let alone the much broader one of semiconductor heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>The Change-Driver Account of Scientific Discovery: Philosophical and Historical Dimensions of the Discovery of the Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the models of scientific discovery propounded by Kuhn, McArthur, Hudson, and Schindler. As an alternative, we proffer the $\unicode{x201c}$change$\unicode{x2013}$driver model$\unicode{x201c}$. It conceives of discoveries as problems or solutions to problems that have epistemically advanced science. Here we take a problem to be generated by a datum that we want to account for and make sense of$\unicode{x2013}$by putting it in contact with our wider web of scientific knowledge and understanding. The model overcomes the shortcomings of its precursors, whilst preserving their insights. We demonstrate its intensional and extensional superiority, especially with respect to the link between scientific discoveries and the dynamics of science. Both as an illustration, and as an application to a recent scientific and political controversy, we apply the considered models of discovery to one of the most momentous discoveries of science: the expansion of the universe.</description>
