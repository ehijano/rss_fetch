      <title>End-to-End Reaction Field Energy Modeling via Deep Learning based Voxel-to-voxel Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational biochemistry and biophysics, understanding the role of electrostatic interactions is crucial for elucidating the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is a foundational tool for modeling these interactions by describing the electrostatic potential in and around charged molecules. However, solving the PB equation presents significant computational challenges due to the complexity of biomolecular surfaces and the need to account for mobile ions. While traditional numerical methods for solving the PB equation are accurate, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with increasing system size. To address these challenges, we introduce PBNeF, a novel machine learning approach inspired by recent advancements in neural network-based partial differential equation solvers. Our method formulates the input and boundary electrostatic conditions of the PB equation into a learnable voxel representation, enabling the use of a neural field transformer to predict the PB solution and, subsequently, the reaction field potential energy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBNeF achieves over a 100-fold speedup compared to traditional PB solvers, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the Generalized Born (GB) model.</description>

      <title>Generative Flows on Synthetic Pathway for Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models in drug discovery have recently gained attention as efficient alternatives to brute-force virtual screening. However, most existing models do not account for synthesizability, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose RxnFlow, which sequentially assembles molecules using predefined molecular building blocks and chemical reaction templates to constrain the synthetic chemical pathway. We then train on this sequential generating process with the objective of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to generate both highly rewarded and diverse molecules. To mitigate the large action space of synthetic pathways in GFlowNets, we implement a novel action space subsampling method. This enables RxnFlow to learn generative flows over extensive action spaces comprising combinations of 1.2 million building blocks and 71 reaction templates without significant computational overhead. Additionally, RxnFlow can employ modified or expanded action spaces for generation without retraining, allowing for the introduction of additional objectives or the incorporation of newly discovered building blocks. We experimentally demonstrate that RxnFlow outperforms existing reaction-based and fragment-based models in pocket-specific optimization across various target pockets. Furthermore, RxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 for pocket-conditional generation, with an average Vina score of -8.85kcal/mol and 34.8% synthesizability.</description>

      <title>Text-guided Diffusion Model for 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with targeted properties is crucial in biology, chemistry, and drug discovery. Current generative models are limited to using single property values as conditions, struggling with complex customizations described in detailed human language. To address this, we propose the text guidance instead, and introduce TextSMOG, a new Text-guided Small Molecule Generation Approach via 3D Diffusion Model which integrates language and diffusion models for text-guided small molecule generation. This method uses textual conditions to guide molecule generation, enhancing both stability and diversity. Experimental results show TextSMOG's proficiency in capturing and utilizing information from textual descriptions, making it a powerful tool for generating 3D molecular structures in response to complex textual customizations.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Models for Inverse Molecular Design with Retrosynthetic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have integrated images, adapting them to graphs remains challenging, limiting their applications in materials and drug design. This difficulty stems from the need for coherent autoregressive generation across texts and graphs. To address this, we introduce Llamole, the first multimodal LLM capable of interleaved text and graph generation, enabling molecular inverse design with retrosynthetic planning. Llamole integrates a base LLM with the Graph Diffusion Transformer and Graph Neural Networks for multi-conditional molecular generation and reaction inference within texts, while the LLM, with enhanced molecular understanding, flexibly controls activation among the different graph modules. Additionally, Llamole integrates A* search with LLM-based cost functions for efficient retrosynthetic planning. We create benchmarking datasets and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate Llamole against in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Llamole significantly outperforms 14 adapted LLMs across 12 metrics for controllable molecular design and retrosynthetic planning.</description>

      <title>Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in Biological Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing biological sequences with desired properties is a significant challenge due to the combinatorially vast search space and the high cost of evaluating each candidate sequence. To address these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as GFlowNets, utilize proxy models for rapid reward evaluation and annotated data for policy training. Although these approaches have shown promise in generating diverse and novel sequences, the limited training data relative to the vast search space often leads to the misspecification of proxy for out-of-distribution inputs. We introduce $\delta$-Conservative Search, a novel off-policy search method for training GFlowNets designed to improve robustness against proxy misspecification. The key idea is to incorporate conservativeness, controlled by parameter $\delta$, to constrain the search to reliable regions. Specifically, we inject noise into high-score offline sequences by randomly masking tokens with a Bernoulli distribution of parameter $\delta$ and then denoise masked tokens using the GFlowNet policy. Additionally, $\delta$ is adaptively adjusted based on the uncertainty of the proxy model for each data point. This enables the reflection of proxy uncertainty to determine the level of conservativeness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing machine learning methods in discovering high-score sequences across diverse tasks-including DNA, RNA, protein, and peptide design-especially in large-scale scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pullback Flow Matching on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Pullback Flow Matching (PFM), a novel framework for generative modeling on data manifolds. Unlike existing methods that assume or learn restrictive closed-form manifold mappings for training Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) models, PFM leverages pullback geometry and isometric learning to preserve the underlying manifold's geometry while enabling efficient generation and precise interpolation in latent space. This approach not only facilitates closed-form mappings on the data manifold but also allows for designable latent spaces, using assumed metrics on both data and latent manifolds. By enhancing isometric learning through Neural ODEs and proposing a scalable training objective, we achieve a latent space more suitable for interpolation, leading to improved manifold learning and generative performance. We demonstrate PFM's effectiveness through applications in synthetic data, protein dynamics and protein sequence data, generating novel proteins with specific properties. This method shows strong potential for drug discovery and materials science, where generating novel samples with specific properties is of great interest.</description>

      <title>FSscore: A Machine Learning-based Synthetic Feasibility Score Leveraging Human Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a molecule can be synthesized is crucial in chemistry and drug discovery, as it guides experimental prioritization and molecule ranking in de novo design tasks. Existing scoring approaches to assess synthetic feasibility struggle to extrapolate to new chemical spaces or fail to discriminate based on subtle differences such as chirality. This work addresses these limitations by introducing the Focused Synthesizability score~(FSscore), which uses machine learning to rank structures based on their relative ease of synthesis. First, a baseline trained on an extensive set of reactant-product pairs is established, which is then refined with expert human feedback tailored to specific chemical spaces. This targeted fine-tuning improves performance on these chemical scopes, enabling more accurate differentiation between molecules that are hard and easy to synthesize. The FSscore showcases how a human-in-the-loop framework can be utilized to optimize the assessment of synthetic feasibility for various chemical applications.</description>

      <title>ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</description>
