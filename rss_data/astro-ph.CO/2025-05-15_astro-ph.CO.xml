      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: II. Framework for Cosmological Distance Measurements via Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\%$, $1.1\%$, and $9.3\% \,(3.6\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to $1.2\%$, $0.6\%$, and $1.5\%\,(0.4\%)$. The EEM thus offers a powerful geometric alternative for cosmic distance determination.</description>

      <title>Saha ionization for non-equilibrium states: an application to primordial hydrogen recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that the Saha equation is not suitable for describing plasmas out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The primordial hydrogen recombination plasma is an example of this. In this work, we propose a theoretical modification to the standard Saha curve by introducing a non-Gaussian generalization of the Saha equation, motivated by Tsallis statistics. In particular, we explore the possibility that a time-dependent $q$-parameter may serve as an effective proxy for the evolving thermodynamic conditions during recombination, especially considering that hydrogen recombination occurs from excited states. Within this framework, the $q$-parameter could be interpreted as encoding departures from equilibrium and could play the role of effective time-dependent temperature. This indicates that the time evolution of the $q$-parameter could provide a phenomenological mechanism for incorporating non-equilibrium effects into the recombination history. Our findings suggest that the Tsallis parameterization provides an alternative path to fit the distribution of free electrons by using an effective temperature. Our approach enables us to reproduce hydrogen recombination results predicted by the Peebles kinetic approach, HYREC-2 code, or any other recombination model.</description>

      <title>Limits on the 21 cm power spectrum at z=6.5-7.0 from MWA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the spherically-averaged 21 cm power spectrum derived from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) observations conducted with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The analysis uses EoR0-field data, centered at (RA$=0h$, DEC$=-27^{\circ}$), collected between 2013 and 2023. Building on the improved methodology described in Trott et al. 2020, we incorporate additional data quality control techniques introduced in Nunhokee et al. 2024. We report the lowest power level limits on the EoR power spectrum at redshifts $z=6.5$, $z=6.8$, and $z=7.0$. These power levels, measured in the East-West polarization, are $(30.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $(31.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $(39.1)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.21\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ respectively. The total integration time amounts to 268 hours. These results represent the deepest upper limits achieved by the MWA to date and provide the first evidence of heated intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts $z=6.5$ to $7.0$.</description>

      <title>Late-time suppression of structure growth as a solution for the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S_8$ value inferred from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 cosmic shear data, under the assumption of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, is 2-3$\sigma$ lower than that inferred from observations of the early-time universe, such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data. Resolving the $S_8$ tension requires a scenario in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed in the late universe. As potential solutions, we consider extended models both within and beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model -- models that incorporate parameterized baryonic feedback effects, the effect of varying neutrino mass, and modified structure growth, each of which can lead to a suppression of structure growth at lower redshifts, with its own distinct scale- and redshift-dependencies. In particular, we consider phenomenological modified gravity models in which the suppression of structure growth is triggered at lower redshifts, as dark energy ($\Lambda$) begins to dominate the background expansion. We show that the modified growth factor models -- especially those featuring more rapid growth suppression at lower redshifts -- provide an improved fit to the combined datasets of the HSC-Y3 cosmic shear correlation functions, the Planck CMB, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing, compared to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and the models including the baryonic effects or the massive neutrino effect within the the $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>The Dual Primordial Black Hole Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel mechanism where two families of primordial black holes (PBHs) may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO. Our work thus provides a unified observational window into the physics of inflation, reheating, and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Efficient Modelling of Lyman-{\alpha} opacity fluctuations during late EoR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed from high redshift quasar spectra have been proven to be extremely successful in order to probe the late phase of the reionization epoch. For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman alpha forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compare the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrate that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model i.e. the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursue an MCMC-based parameter space exploration utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations. This study holds significant promise for efficiently extracting important physical information about the Epoch of Reionization, utilizing the wealth of available and upcoming observational data.</description>

      <title>When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a tendency toward a negative $w_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, a result that is particularly intriguing and may have meaningful implications for modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly{\alpha} 1D power spectrum: The Fast Fourier Transform estimator measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The measurement of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I share fond memories of my former PhD advisor Alexei Starobinsky with whom I was closely associated for nearly 45 years. I reflect upon my early years in Moscow when I worked with him on my thesis, and touch upon the seminal work on inflation which he did during that period. Alexei visited India often and actively interacted with Indian scientists and students on issues relating to inflation, large scale structure and dark energy. This extensive collaboration, which lasted several decades, resulted in the publication of over a dozen important papers, several PhD's, and the development of the Statefinder and Om diagnostics, which I briefly discuss.</description>

      <title>Full-Spectrum Analysis of Gravitational Wave Production from Inflation to Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study gravitational wave (GW) production during both the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. While inflationary GWs can be readily derived from tensor perturbations during inflation, post-inflationary GWs arise from a variety of processes during reheating and require detailed treatment for quantitative analysis. We consider four distinct production channels: $(i)$ pure inflaton annihilation, $(ii)$ graviton bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $(iii)$ radiation-catalyzed inflaton-graviton conversion, and $(iv)$ scattering among fully thermalized radiation particles. For each channel, we solve the corresponding Boltzmann equation to obtain the GW spectrum and derive a simple yet accurate analytical expression for it. By employing a consistent treatment of all production channels, our analysis yields for the first time the full spectrum of GWs produced during the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. We find that, while inflationary GWs dominate at low frequencies, post-inflationary processes generally produce high-frequency GWs with considerably high energy densities that may significantly exceed that of inflationary GWs.</description>

      <title>Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization Are All Bark and No Bite -- Plenty of Ionizing Photons, Low Escape Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using JWST imaging and prism spectroscopy for 426 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar--population and nebular--emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, f_esc. We find that the ionization production efficiency, $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, $\sigma( \log \xi_\mathrm{ion})$ ~= 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are $\langle f_\mathrm{esc} \rangle$ = 3 +\pm 1% with no indication of evolution over 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. This implies that in our models nearly all of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ and f_esc, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of x_e=0.5 at 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.1, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain x_e = 0.5 at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 9.6, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Leinster-Cobbold diversity index as a criterion for sub-clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An automatic procedure to perform sub-clustering on large samples is presented. At each iteration, the most diverse cluster is sub-clustered, and the global diversity of the new classification is compared to the previous one. The process stops if no improvement is found. The key to our procedure is the use of a quantitative measure of diversity, called the Leinster-Cobbold index, that takes into account the similarity between clusters. While this procedure has been successfully applied on a large sample of spectra of galaxies, we illustrate its efficiency with two examples in this paper.</description>

      <title>Precision Joint Constraints on Cosmology and Gravity Using Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian framework to jointly constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, a key probe of deviations from general relativity, using the population characteristics of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events from binary black hole mergers. Unlike traditional methods that rely on electromagnetic counterparts or GW waveform modeling, our approach exploits the time-delay distribution and the total number of lensed events, achievable with third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we demonstrate that this method can achieve precision levels of $0.4\% - 0.7\%$ for$ H_0$ and $0.5\% - 3.3\%$ for $\gamma$ at $68\%$ credibility, significantly outperforming existing joint constraints. These results underscore the power of lensed GW population statistics as a robust and efficient probe of both cosmic expansion and the nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Our results highlight the unique potential of modelling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <title>On the origin of transient features in cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of gravitational clustering at small scales on larger scales by studying mode coupling between virialised halos. We build on the calculation by Peebles (1974) where it was shown that a virialised halo does not contribute any mode coupling terms at small wave numbers $k$. Using a perturbative expansion in wave number, we show that this effect is small and arises from the deviation of halo shapes from spherical and also on tidal interactions between halos. We connect this with the impact of finite mass resolution of cosmological N-Body simulations on the evolution of perturbations at early times. This difference between the expected evolution and the evolution obtained in cosmological N-Body simulations can be quantified using such an estimate. We also explore the impact of a finite shortest scale up to which the desired power spectrum is realised in simulations. Several simulation studies have shown that this effect is small in comparison with the effect of perturbations at large scales on smaller scales. It is nevertheless important to study these effects and develop a general approach for estimating their magnitude. This is especially relevant in the present era of precision cosmology. We provide basic estimates of the magnitude of these effects and their power spectrum dependence. We find that the impact of small scale cutoff in the initial power spectrum and discreteness increases with $(n+3)$, with $n$ being the index of the power spectrum. In general, we recommend that cosmological simulation data should be used only if the scale of non-linearity, defined as the scale where the linearly extrapolated {\it rms} amplitude of fluctuations is unity, is larger than the average inter-particle separation.</description>

      <title>Chasing the beginning of reionization in the JWST era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations at $z &gt; 6$ may imply galactic ionizing photon production above prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a $z \sim 8-9$ end to reionization, in tension with the $z &lt; 6$ end required by the Ly$\alpha$ forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early ($z_{\rm end} \approx 8$) alongside two more realistic scenarios with $z_{\rm end} \approx 5$: one starting late ($z \sim 9$) and another early ($z \sim 13$). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at $6 &lt; z &lt; 12$, perhaps in tension with measurements of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity, mean free path, IGM thermal history, visibility of $z &gt; 8$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the CMB. We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is strongly disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance arising from deficiencies in observations and/or theoretical modeling. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will establish a concordance picture of reionization's beginning or uncover such deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Dark sector interactions in light of weak lensing data</title>

Abstract: The current observational tensions in the standard cosmological model have reinforced the research on dynamical dark energy, in particular on models with non-gravitational interaction between the dark components. Analyses of late-time observables like type Ia supernovas (SNe Ia) and large-scale structures (LSS) are not conclusive about the presence of energy flux between dark energy and dark matter, while the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is fully consistent with no interaction at all. As background and visible matter tests are less sensitive to the suppression/enhancement in the dark matter power spectrum, which is a characteristic of interacting models, while the CMB spectrum is strongly affected by it, this could be the origin of those results. In order to confirm it and at the same time to rule out the role of possible systematics between early and late-time observations, the use of a low redshift observable sensitive to the gravitational potential generated by dark matter is crucial. In the present paper, we investigate the observational viability of a class of interacting dark energy models, namely with energy exchange between vacuum-type and dust components, in the light of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) observations of galaxy weak lensing, in the context of a spatially-flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The best fit of our analysis is entirely consistent with null interaction, confirming the CMB based constraints.</description>

      <title>A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant (\texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0}) measurements, ranging from 4 to 6$\sigma$. In the current study, we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, Pantheon+ (P+), Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey, (DES) catalogs combined together into the so-called Master Sample. The sample contains 3714 SNe Ia, and is divided all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Three binning techniques are presented: the equi-population, the moving window (MW), and the equi-spacing in the \texorpdfstring{$\log-z$}{log-z}. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat \texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$CDM}{LCDM} and the \texorpdfstring{$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM}{w0waCDM} models. These \texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0} values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$}{H0(z) = H0tilde / (1 + z)^alpha}, where \texorpdfstring{$\tilde{H}_0$}{H0tilde} is a free parameter representing \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z)$}{H0(z)} fitted in \texorpdfstring{$z=0$}{z=0}, and \texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha} is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by \texorpdfstring{$\alpha \sim 0.01$}{alpha ~ 0.01}, whose consistency with zero ranges from $1 \sigma$ in 5 cases to 1 case at 3 $\sigma$ and 11 cases at $&gt; 3 \sigma$ in several samples and configurations. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>

Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM by independently parameterizing modifications in the background evolution and the growth of structures. The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $A=\Omega_{m0}$ and $B=2/3$ in the $\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the growth of structures are captured through a fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets involving background expansion and growth of structures (related to observations involving redshift space distortions), we find significant evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM in the background expansion whereas there is no finite evidence for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the growth of structures. This suggests that with the current precision in observational data involving background and perturbed Universe, a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour is confirmed (as shown in the recent DESI-DR2 results). But whether this deviation is due to an evolving Dark Energy or due to the modification of gravity at cosmological scales is still an open question, largely due to less precise data from perturbed Universe. We further demonstrate how the future high-precision growth data (from Euclid, for example) can answer such question using a forecast study.</description>

      <title>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

Abstract: The Lukash metric is a homogeneous gravitational wave which at late times approximates the behaviour of a generic class of spatially homogenous cosmological models with monotonically decreasing energy density. The transcription from Brinkmann to Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) to Bianchi coordinates is presented and the relation to a Sturm-Liouville equation is explained. The 6-parameter isometry group is derived. In the Bianchi VII range of parameters we have two BJR transciptions. However using either of them induces a mere relabeling of the geodesics and isometries. Following pioneering work of Siklos, we provide a self-contained account of the geometry and global structure of the spacetime. The latter contains a Killing horizon to the future of which the spacetime resembles an anisotropic version of the Milne cosmology and to the past of which it resemble the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <title>Constraining the effective field theory of dark energy with multimessenger astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of dark energy predicts a possible time variation of the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GW) which could be tested with multimessenger astronomy. For this purpose we derive the relation between the redshift dependence of the propagation speed of GWs and the time delay between the detection of GWs and electromagnetic waves (EMWs) emitted by the same source. According to the EFT the friction term of the GW propagation equation depends on the effective Planck mass and GW speed time variation, affecting the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio. We compute the general form of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio in terms of the effective GW speed and effective Planck mass, and then focus on theories with constant Planck mass (CPM) and time varying GW speed. For CPM theories the GW speed can be jointly constrained by the GW-EMW detection time delay and luminosity distance ratio, allowing to derive a consistency relation between these two observables. The event GW170817 and its EM counterpart satisfy the CPM consistency condition, and allows to set constraints on the time variation of the GWs speed, and consequently on the coefficients of the effective theory.</description>

Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <title>FIMP Dark Matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to explore the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates, assuming a constant thermal averaged Dark Matter production cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$), as well as a preliminary analysis of the non-constant case. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, where $T_\text{end}$ corresponds to the temperature at which $\phi$ decays, $\kappa$ is the ratio between the initial energy density of $\phi$ and radiation, and $m_\chi$ is the Dark Matter mass, we identify extensive new parameter regions where Dark Matter can be successfully established while reproducing the currently observed relic density, in contrast to the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>
