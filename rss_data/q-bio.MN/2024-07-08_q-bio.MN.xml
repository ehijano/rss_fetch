      <title>Theory of epigenetic switching due to stochastic histone mark loss during DNA replication</title>

Abstract: How much information does a cell inherit from its ancestors beyond its genetic sequence? What are the epigenetic mechanisms that allow this? Despite the rise in available epigenetic data, how such information is inherited through the cell cycle is still not fully understood. Here, we develop and analyse a simple mathematical model for histone-based epigenetic information that describes how daughter cells can recapitulate the gene expression profiles of their parent. We consider the dynamics of histone modifications during the cell cycle deterministically but also incorporate the largest stochastic element: DNA replication, where histones are randomly distributed between the two daughter DNA strands. This hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach enables an analytic derivation of the switching rate, i.e., the frequency of loss-of-memory events due to replication. While retaining great simplicity, the model can recapitulate experimental switching rate data, establishing its biological importance as a framework to quantitatively study epigenetic inheritance.</description>

      <title>Modular Control of Biological Networks</title>

Abstract: The concept of control is central to understanding and applications of biological network models. Some of their key structural features relate to control functions, through gene regulation, signaling, or metabolic mechanisms, and computational models need to encode these. Applications of models often focus on model-based control, such as in biomedicine or metabolic engineering. This paper presents an approach to model-based control that exploits two common features of biological networks, namely their modular structure and canalizing features of their regulatory mechanisms. The paper focuses on intracellular regulatory networks, represented by Boolean network models. A main result of this paper is that control strategies can be identified by focusing on one module at a time. This paper also presents a criterion based on canalizing features of the regulatory rules to identify modules that do not contribute to network control and can be excluded. For even moderately sized networks, finding global control inputs is computationally very challenging. The modular approach presented here leads to a highly efficient approach to solving this problem. This approach is applied to a published Boolean network model of blood cancer large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia to identify a minimal control set that achieves a desired control objective.</description>

Abstract: Logical modeling is a powerful tool in biology, offering a system-level understanding of the complex interactions that govern biological processes. A gap that hinders the scalability of logical models is the need to specify the update function of every vertex in the network depending on the status of its predecessors. To address this, we introduce in this paper the concept of strong regulation, where a vertex is only updated to active/inactive if all its predecessors agree in their influences; otherwise, it is set to ambiguous. We explore the interplay between active, inactive, and ambiguous influences in a network. We discuss the existence of phenotype attractors in such networks, where the status of some of the variables is fixed to active/inactive, while the others can have an arbitrary status, including ambiguous.</description>
