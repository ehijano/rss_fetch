      <title>$\mathcal{F}$-harmonic 3-forms and the Type IIA flow on 6-dimensional symplectic Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of $\mathcal{F}$-harmonic forms and the long-time behavior of the Type IIA flow on certain nilpotent and solvable symplectic Lie algebras (and corresponding nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds). In particular, we demonstrate that the Type IIA flow in these cases are very useful to detect desired geometric structures including Lagrangian torus fibrations and harmonic almost complex structures.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on pointwise normality of self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an exposition of recent results and methods on the prevalence of normal numbers in the support of self-similar measures on the line. We also provide an essentially self-contained proof of a recent Theorem that the Rajchman property (decay of the Fourier transform) implies that typical elements in the support of the measure are normal to all bases; as no decay rate is required, this improves the classical criterion of Davenport, Erdos, and LeVeque (1964). Open problems regarding effective equidistribution, non-integer bases, and higher order correlations, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture -- the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis' -- is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Oscillation inequalities for Carleson--Dunkl operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish estimates for the oscillation seminorm for the so-called Carleson--Dunkl operator on weighted $L^p(\mathbb{R},w(x)|x|^{2\alpha+1}{\rm d}x)$ spaces with power weights $w(x)=|x|^\beta$. As a result, we obtain oscillation estimates for the standard Carleson operator on $L_{\rm rad}^p(\mathbb{R}^n,|x|^\beta{\rm d}x)$. As a byproduct, we obtain a transference principle for radial multipliers on $L_{\rm rad}^p$ spaces, in the spirit of the Rubio de Francia transference principle.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Hu and Kim defined a new type of gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ from the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$, and obtained some of its properties. In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication and distribution formulas, and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <title>Memories of Ian G. Macdonald</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a slightly edited translation of a paper in Dutch which appeared in Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde (5) 25 (2024), No.2, 87-90 on the occasion of I.G. Macdonald's death in 2023, and aimed at a very broad mathematical audience. First we review some of Macdonald's most important older results. Then we focus on the period 1985-1995 when Macdonald often visited the Netherlands and there was much interaction between his work, notably the Macdonald polynomials, and the work by the authors. We end with some glimpses about Macdonald as a person.</description>

      <title>New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Flux Functions of Convexity Degeneracy and Global Dynamic Patterns of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with a new solution formula and its applications to the analysis of properties of entropy solutions of the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. We first introduce/validate the novel formula for entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem, which generalizes the Lax-Oleinik formula. Then, by employing this formula, we obtain a series of fine properties of entropy solutions and discover several new structures and phenomena, which include: (i) Series of results on the fine structures of entropy solutions, especially including the new criteria for all six types of initial waves for the Cauchy problem, the new structures of entropy solutions inside the backward characteristic triangle, and the new features of the formation and development of shocks such as all five types of continuous shock generation points, along with their criteria and the optimal regularities of the corresponding resulting shocks; (ii) Series of results on the global structures of entropy solutions, including the four new invariants of entropy solutions, the new criteria for the locations and speeds of divides, and the exact determination of the global structures of entropy solutions; (iii) Series of new results on the asymptotic behaviors of entropy solutions, including the asymptotic profiles and decay rates of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$, respectively in the $L^\infty$--norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$--norm. Through these results above, we obtain the global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) and general initial data in $L^\infty$. Moreover, the new solution formula is also extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>
