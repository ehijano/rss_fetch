      <title>A Modified Bisecting K-Means for Approximating Transfer Operators: Application to the Lorenz Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence behavior of the extended dynamic mode decomposition for constructing a discretization of the continuity equation associated with the Lorenz equations using a nonlinear dictionary of over 1,000,000 terms. The primary objective is to analyze the resulting operator by varying the number of terms in the dictionary and the timescale. We examine what happens when the number of terms of the nonlinear dictionary is varied with respect to its ability to represent the invariant measure, Koopman eigenfunctions, and temporal autocorrelations. The dictionary comprises piecewise constant functions through a modified bisecting k-means algorithm and can efficiently scale to higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Discovering Fractional Differential Equations in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex physical systems, conventional differential equations often fall short in capturing non-local and memory effects, as they are limited to local dynamics and integer-order interactions. This study introduces a stepwise data-driven framework for discovering fractional differential equations (FDEs) directly from data. FDEs, known for their capacity to model non-local dynamics with fewer parameters than integer-order derivatives, can represent complex systems with long-range interactions. Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques. We validate the framework across various datasets, including synthetic anomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozen soils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\'{e}vy motion. Results demonstrate the framework's robustness in identifying the structure of FDEs across diverse noise levels and its capacity to capture integer-order dynamics, offering a flexible approach for modeling memory effects in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Aspects of Large Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An introduction to numerical large-deviation sampling is provided. First, direct biasing with a known distribution is explained. As simple example, the Bernoulli experiment is used throughout the text. Next, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are introduced. In particular, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is explained. As first implementation of MCMC, sampling of the plain Bernoulli model is shown. Next, an exponential bias is used for the same model, which allows one to obtain the tails of the distribution of a measurable quantity. This approach is generalized to MCMC simulations, where the states are vectors of $U(0,1)$ random entries. This allows one to use the exponential or any other bias to access the large-deviation properties of rather arbitrary random processes. Finally, some recent research applications to study more complex models are discussed.</description>

      <title>PLUMED Tutorials: a collaborative, community-driven learning ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational physics, chemistry, and biology, the implementation of new techniques in a shared and open source software lowers barriers to entry and promotes rapid scientific progress. However, effectively training new software users presents several challenges. Common methods like direct knowledge transfer and in-person workshops are limited in reach and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of online training, traditional online tutorials can quickly become outdated and may not cover all the software's functionalities. To address these issues, here we introduce ``PLUMED Tutorials'', a collaborative model for developing, sharing, and updating online tutorials. This initiative utilizes repository management and continuous integration to ensure compatibility with software updates. Moreover, the tutorials are interconnected to form a structured learning path and are enriched with automatic annotations to provide broader context. This paper illustrates the development, features, and advantages of PLUMED Tutorials, aiming to foster an open community for creating and sharing educational resources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Control of Electron Dynamics within Hartree-Fock Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of determining the optimal applied electric field to drive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even moderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact equations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is numerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the TDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort while maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We frame this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF equations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed via a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show that with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method yields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and tolerances.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit and mapping algorithms for wavepacket dynamics: case study of anharmonic hydrogen bonds in protonated and hydroxide water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice with an Indefinite Long-Range Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies have emphasized the impact of long-range Coulomb interactions in lattice fermions, yet conventional Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face limitations due to their reliance on positive definite interaction matrices. We address this by decomposing the interaction matrix into positive- and negative-definite components, allowing for QMC calculations with manageable sign properties. This technique enables effective simulations on large lattices. Applying it to a honeycomb lattice with an indefinite interaction matrix, we identify a semi-metal to charge density wave phase transition within the Gross-Neveu criticality class. Notably, the phase transition boundary aligns with regions where the average sign sharply decreases, providing new evidence to the increasingly compelling research on the relationship between phase transitions and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>A large language model-type architecture for high-dimensional molecular potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional \b{eta}-phase copper iodide: a promising candidate for low-temperature thermoelectric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth telluride-based materials is the only commercially viable room-temperature thermoelectric material, despite its limited tellurium and poor mechanical properties. The search for materials with a high figure of merit (zT &gt; 1.00) near room temperature remains a major challenge. In this work, we systematically investigate the structural stability and the thermoelectric capabilities of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and {\gamma}-CuI through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Boltzmann transport theory. Based on the thermoelectric transport coefficients of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI and {\gamma}-CuI, we predict their zT values will vary with carrier concentration and increase with temperature. Comparing the zT values, monolayer \b{eta}-CuI demonstrates superior thermoelectric properties compared to {\gamma}-CuI. At room temperature, the optimal zT values of monolayer \b{eta}-CuI exceed 1.50, with particularly high values of 2.98 (p-type) and 4.10 (n-type) along the Zigzag direction, demonstrating significant anisotropy. These results suggest the great potential of the monolayer \b{eta}-CuI is promising candidate materials for low temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with quantum embedding techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>
