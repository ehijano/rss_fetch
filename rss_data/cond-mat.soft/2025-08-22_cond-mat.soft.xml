      <title>Disordered origins, deterministic outcomes: How the architecture of elastic networks imprints relaxed structure and mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work targets the influence of disorder on the relaxed structure and macroscopic mechanical properties of elastic networks. We construct network classes of different types of disorder (length, topology and stiffness), which are subsequently equilibrated in a finite kinematics setting. Relaxed network structures are distinct among network classes, which opens the path towards exploiting easily accessible experimental measures as a way of inferring further microstructural details.</description>

      <title>Polarization Mechanism of Bacteria Motion in Aquatic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model of light-induced bacteria motion in an aqueous medium is proposed. The model concerns bacteria both with and without flagellae. It is based on the hydrodynamics of active matter and allows for the changes of polarization of both bacteria and the medium. Natural light is assumed to intensify the motion of clusters with different refraction indices within the bacteria and to modify their polarization. Such motion of polarized globules causes an increase in deformations and inhomogeneous polarization distribution on the bacteria surfaces. The free energy functional is used to calculate the perturbation of the bacteria surfaces and inhomogeneous polarization distributions that may either move along the bacteria or rotate. Mechanical interaction of surface deformations with water flows or interaction of the inhomogeneous polarization with free charges causes bacteria motion in the medium. Estimates of the bacteria motion velocity in the case of the proposed mechanism are made and it corresponded to experimentally observed values.</description>

      <title>Suspended phase transitions: droplets trapped by solid films resist complete melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting is conventionally understood as a bulk first-order phase transition, where nucleation of the liquid phase is followed by rapid growth until the solid disappears. However, in thin crystalline films containing local heterogeneities, this process can be dramatically altered by interfacial forces. Here, we report experimental evidence of suspended melting in molecularly thin films of long-chain alkanes containing trapped liquid droplets. As temperature increases, these droplets expand and flatten, yet remain pinned within the surrounding solid layers, preventing full melting. The observed sensitivity of apparent contact angle to small temperature changes is explained by a theoretical model balancing bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energies. This work highlights how melting in thin films can be frustrated and spatially arrested by local wetting constraints, revealing a rich interplay between phase transition dynamics, confinement, and interfacial topology. Beyond alkanes, these results suggest a generic mechanism by which melting, wetting, and film morphology conspire to locally suspend phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Marangoni swimmer pushing particle raft under 1D confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter systems, due to their spontaneous self-propulsion ability, hold potential for future applications in healthcare and environmental sustainability. Marangoni swimmers, a type of synthetic active matter, are a common model system for understanding the underlying physics. Existing studies of the interactions of active matter with passive particles have mostly focused on the modification of the behavior of the passive particles. In contrast, we analyse here experimentally the impact on the self-propulsion of camphor-infused agarose disks (active) of their interactions with floating hollow glass microspheres (passive) within an annular channel. Two distinct regimes are observed: a steady regime with uni-directional motion of the swimmer at low packing fractions (\phi_{\textrm{ini}} \lesssim 0.45) and an oscillatory regime with to-and-fro motion at higher packing fractions (\phi_{\textrm{ini}} \gtrsim 0.45). In the former, the swimmer pushes nearly the entire particle raft together with it, like a towing cargo, causing a decrease in swimmer speed with increasing packing fraction due to the additional drag from the particle raft. A simplified force-balance model is finally proposed that captures the experimental trend in swimmer speed reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Microphases in Active Brownian Particle Systems Lead to Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter can consume energy to generate active forces that propel themselves and to exhibit numerous fascinating out-of-equilibrium features. The paradigmatic model, active Brownian particles, even without attractive and alignment interactions, can form a phase coexistence of low- and high-density phases. Recent researches have revealed that particles within the high-density phase move in a coordinated manner, creating either aligned or vortex-like velocity-correlation domains. However, the mechanism underlying the translation or rotation of these domains remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the velocity-correlation domains are spatially consistent with the ordered microphases. The microphases, surrounded by defects, are hexatic and differently oriented microdomains. The direction of particles' active forces at the edge of a microphase tends to point inward, creating compression that maintains this microphase. The net active force or active torque acting on the microphase causes it to translate or rotate, thereby generating the velocity-correlation domains.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Polymer translocation through extended patterned pores: scaling of the total translocation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the translocation of a flexible polymer through extended patterned pores using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We consider cylindrical and conical pore geometries that can be controlled by the angle of the pore apex $\alpha$. We obtained the average translocation time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for various chain lengths $N$ and the length of the pores $L_p$ for various values $\alpha$ and found that $\langle \tau \rangle$ scales as $\langle \tau \rangle \sim N^\gamma \mathcal{F}\left( L_p N^\phi \right)$ with exponents $\gamma = 3.00\pm0.05$ and $\phi = 1.50\pm0.05$ for both patterned and unpatterned pores.</description>

      <title>Surface separation in elastoplastic contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We study the effect of plastic deformation on the surface separation between two solids with random roughness. Assuming a constant penetration hardness, we propose a procedure within Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory to obtain the average surface separation by applying the elastic formulation to an effective power spectrum that accounts for plastic smoothing. Deterministic numerical simulations based on the boundary element method are used to validate the procedure and show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The treatment also provides a route to incorporate plastic stiffening of the roughness as the stress state becomes increasingly hydrostatic at large plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Thermostats on the Dynamics of the Helix-Coil Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for the nonequilibrium dynamics of the collapse and helix-coil transition in polyalanine. In particular, we compare the influence of three different thermostats, viz., the Langevin, Andersen, and Nos\'e-Hoover thermostats. For that purpose, we investigate the nonequilibrium pathways of the transition from the high-temperature random-coil state to the low-temperature helical state. Additionally, we analyze the time evolution of the potential energy and temperature. Our results show only small differences in the observed phenomenology, albeit quantitatively the dynamics appear to be different for the three thermostats.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of the Helix-Coil Transition in Polyalanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the nonequilibrium pathways of the collapse of the helix-forming biopolymer polyalanine are investigated. To this end, the full time evolution of the helix-coil transition is simulated using molecular dynamics simulations. At the start of the transition short $3_{10}$-helices form, seemingly leading to the molecule becoming more aspherical midway through the collapse. After the completed collapse, the formation of $\alpha$-helices seems to become the prevalent ordering mechanism leading to helical bundles, a structure representative for the equilibrium behavior of longer chains. The dynamics of this transition is explored in terms of the power-law scaling of two associated relaxation times as a function of the chain length.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning of a biflagellate model microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many microswimmers are able to swim through viscous fluids by employing periodic non-reciprocal deformations of their appendages. Here we use a simple microswimmer model inspired by swimming biflagellates which consists of a spherical cell body and two small spherical beads representing the motion of the two flagella. Using reinforcement learning we identify for different microswimmer morphologies quasi-optimized swimming strokes. For all studied cases the identified strokes result in symmetric and quasi-synchronized beating of the two flagella beads. Interestingly, the stroke-averaged flow fields are of pusher type, and the observed swimming gaits outperform previously used biflagellate microswimmer models relying on predefined circular flagella bead motion.</description>

      <title>Controlling polymerization-induced phase separation in the synthesis of porous gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous gels -- gels with solvent-filled pores that are much larger than their mesh size -- are widely used in engineering and biomedical applications due to their tunable mechanics, high water content, and selective permeability. Among various strategies to create porous gels, polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) has shown particular promise. However, the conditions that trigger and control PIPS remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of solvent quality, polymeric precursor molecular weight, and polymer concentration on phase separation in polymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate gels. We find that phase separation occurs when the precursor solution concentration is below the overlap concentration. Phase-separated gels have a pore geometry that is controlled by solvent quality: better solvents result in smaller pores, while worse solvents can create superporous, highly-absorbant gels. Motivated by our results, we propose a theory that predicts when phase separation occurs in polymerizing gels, applicable across a wide range of polymer/solvent gel systems. Our results provide a framework for the rational design of porous gels.</description>

      <title>Shear induced topological changes of local structure in dense colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural origins of glass formation and mechanical response remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Recent studies have identified the local caging potential experienced by a particle due to its nearest neighbors as a robust structural metric that links microscopic structure to dynamics under thermal fluctuations and applied shear. However, its connection to locally favored structural motifs has remained unclear. Here, we analyze structural motifs in colloidal crystals and glasses and correlate them with the local caging potential. We find that icosahedral motifs in glasses are associated with deeper caging potentials than crystalline motifs such as face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures. Both crystalline and amorphous systems also contain large number of particles belonging to stable defective motifs, which are distortions of the regular motifs. Under shear, large clusters of defective motifs fragment into smaller ones, driving plastic deformation and the transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like state in amorphous suspensions. Particles that leave clusters of stable motifs are associated with shallower caging potentials and are more prone to plastic rearrangements, ultimately leading to motif disintegration during shear. Our results thus reveal that the loss of mechanical stability in amorphous suspensions is governed by the topological evolution of polytetrahedral motifs, uncovering a structural mechanism underlying plastic deformation and fluidization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP2K is a versatile open-source software package for simulations across a wide range of atomistic systems, from isolated molecules in the gas phase to low-dimensional functional materials and interfaces, as well as highly symmetric crystalline solids, disordered amorphous glasses, and weakly interacting soft-matter systems in the liquid state and in solution. This review highlights CP2K's capabilities for computing both static and dynamical properties using quantum-mechanical and classical simulation methods. In contrast to the accompanying theory and code paper [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)], the focus here is on the practical usage and applications of CP2K, with underlying theoretical concepts introduced only as needed.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>

Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems, swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that this results from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, our estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <title>Structural Anisotropy Stabilises Asymmetric Beating in Instability Driven Filaments</title>

Abstract: Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending stiffnesses impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending stiffness ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Flow Behaviors of Supercooled Liquids by Embodying Solid-Liquid Duality at Particle Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the flow behaviors of supercooled liquids presents a major challenge in liquid-state physics due to the strong nonlinearity and rich phenomena. To unravel this complexity, we introduce the concept of local configurational relaxation time $\tau_\rm{LC}$, which allows us to embody the solid-liquid duality, proposed by Maxwell for phenomenologically describing materials' response to external load, at the particle level. The spatial distribution of $\tau_\rm{LC}$ in flow is heterogeneous. Depending on the comparison between the local mobility measured by $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the external shear rate, the shear response of local regions is either solid-like or liquid-like. In this way, $\tau_\rm{LC}$ plays a role similar to the Maxwell time. By applying this microscopic solid-liquid duality to different conditions of shear flow with a wide range of shear rates, we describe the emergence of shear thinning in steady shear, and predict the major characteristics of the transient response to start-up shear. Furthermore, we reveal a clear structural foundation for $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the solid-liquid duality associated with it by introducing an order parameter extracted from local configuration. Thus, we establish a framework that connects microscopic structure, dynamics, local mechanical response, and flow behaviors for supercooled liquids. Finally, we rationalize our framework in terms of activations from energy basins that are facilitated by shear. This model illustrates how local structure, convection and thermal activation collectively determine $\tau_\rm{LC}$. Notably, it predicts two distinct response groups, which well correspond to the microscopic solid-liquid duality.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.</description>

      <title>Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion</title>

Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>
