      <title>A Large-dimensional Analysis of ESPRIT DoA Estimation: Inconsistency and a Correction via RMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform asymptotic analyses of the widely used ESPRIT direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimator for large arrays, where the array size $N$ and the number of snapshots $T$ grow to infinity at the same pace. In this large-dimensional regime, the sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to be a poor eigenspectral estimator of the population covariance. We show that the classical ESPRIT algorithm, that relies on the SCM, and as a consequence of the large-dimensional inconsistency of the SCM, produces inconsistent DoA estimates as $N,T \to \infty$ with $N/T \to c \in (0,\infty)$, for both widely- and closely-spaced DoAs. Leveraging tools from random matrix theory (RMT), we propose an improved G-ESPRIT method and prove its consistency in the same large-dimensional setting. From a technical perspective, we derive a novel bound on the eigenvalue differences between two potentially non-Hermitian random matrices, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of the Sharp Gordon's Lemma: No Eigenvalues for Schr\"odinger Operators with Almost Repetition Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Jitomirskaya-Simon and Jitomirskaya-Liu, who established the absence of eigenvalues for Schr\"odinger operators with almost reflective repetition potentials, we provide a new proof of the sharp Gordon's lemma, which asserts the absence of eigenvalues for Schr\"odinger operators with almost repetition potentials.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison results for Laplacians on discrete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent literature, various authors have studied spectral comparison results for Schr\"odinger operators with discrete spectrum in different settings including Euclidean domains and quantum graphs. In this note we derive such spectral comparison results in a rather general framework for general and possibly infinite discrete graphs. Along the way, we establish a discrete version of the local Weyl law whose proof does neither involve any Tauberian theorem nor the Weyl law as used in the continuous case.</description>

      <title>Explicit Semiclassical Resonances from Many Delta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering resonances arising from multiple $h$-dependent Dirac delta functions on the real line in the semiclassical regime $h \rightarrow 0$. We focus on resonances lying in strings along curves of the form $\text{Im } z \sim -\gamma h\log(1/h)$ and find that resonances along such strings exist if and only if $\gamma$ is a slope of a Newton polygon we construct from the parameters. Furthermore, the set of these $\gamma$ corresponds to a complete and disjoint partitioning of a line segment with delta functions at interval endpoints. Hence, there are at most $N-1$ strings of resonances from $N$ delta functions, improving a bound from (Datchev, Marzuola, &amp; Wunsch 2023). Lastly, we identify a `dominant pair' of delta functions in the sense that they correspond to the longest-living string of resonances, this string is the only one of logarithmic shape with respect to $\text{Re } z$, and no delta functions between them can contribute to strings of resonances. The simple properties of delta functions permit elementary proofs, and we provide many visual examples to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of nonreversible Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the spectral gap of a Markov chain on a finite state space as the second-smallest singular value of the generator of the chain, generalizing the usual definition of spectral gap for reversible chains. We then define the relaxation time of the chain as the inverse of this spectral gap, and show that this relaxation time can be characterized, for any Markov chain, as the time required for convergence of empirical averages. This relaxation time is related to the Cheeger constant and the mixing time of the chain through inequalities that are similar to the reversible case, and the path argument can be used to get upper bounds. Several examples are worked out. An interesting finding from the examples is that the time for convergence of empirical averages in nonreversible chains can often be substantially smaller than the mixing time.</description>

      <title>Nevai's condition for measures with unbounded supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>On the relaxation to equilibrium of a quantum oscillator interacting with a radiation field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate from the point of view of spectral theory the problem of relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a radiation field. Our starting point is a system of infinitely many Pauli master equations governing the time evolution of the occupation probabilities of the available quantum states. The system we consider is derived from the evolution equation for the reduced density operator obtained after the initial interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field, the latter acting as a heat bath. We provide a complete spectral analysis of the infinitesimal generator of the equations, showing thereby that it generates an infinite-dimensional system of hyperbolic type. This implies that every global solution to the equations converge exponentially rapidly toward the corresponding Gibbs equilibrium state. We also provide a complete spectral analysis of a linear pencil naturally associated with the Pauli equations. All of our considerations revolve around the notion of compactness, more specifically around the existence of a new compact embedding result involving a space of sequences of Sobolev type into a weighted space of square-integrable summable sequences.</description>
