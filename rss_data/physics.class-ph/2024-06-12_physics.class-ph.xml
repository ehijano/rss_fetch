      <title>Using gauge invariance to symmetrize the energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that using Noether's Theorem explicitly employing gauge invariance for variations of the electromagnetic four-potential $A^\mu$ straightforwardly ensures that the resulting electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. The Belinfante symmetrization procedure is not necessary. The method is based on Bessel-Hagen's 1921 clarification of Noether's original procedure, suggesting that the symmetry problem arises from an incomplete implementation of Noether's Theorem.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh surface waves of extremal elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal elastic materials here refer to a specific class of elastic materials whose elastic matrices exhibit one or more zero eigenvalues, resulting in soft deformation modes that, in principle, cost no energy. They can be approximated through artificially designed solid microstructures. Extremal elastic materials have exotic bulk wave properties unavailable with conventional solids due to the soft modes, offering unprecedented opportunities for manipulating bulk waves, e.g., acting as phonon polarizers for elastic waves or invisibility cloaks for underwater acoustic waves. Despite their potential, Rayleigh surface waves, crucially linked to bulk wave behaviors of such extremal elastic materials, have largely remained unexplored so far. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the propagation of Rayleigh waves in extremal elastic materials based on continuum theory and verify our findings with designed microstructure metamaterials based on pantographic structures. Dispersion relations and polarizations of Rayleigh waves in extremal elastic materials are derived, and the impact of higher order gradient effects is also investigated by using strain gradient theory. This study provides a continuum model for exploring surface waves in extremal elastic materials and may stimulate applications of extremal elastic materials for controlling surface waves.</description>

      <title>Projective Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the foundations of a projective geometric theory of elasticity, as well as outline a few possible application possibilities. We give the description of the Cauchy stress and infinitesimal strain tensors compatible with coordinate description of projective geometry and derive their transformation rules under projective transformations. We identify these tensors with generalized conics and quadrics; which shows that the material law cannot be directly given as a correlation, and that the absence of normal stresses and normal strains are projective invariants. The transformation of the graph of the Airy stress function is given in a point-wise projective three dimensional way, which preserves Pucher's equation corresponding to a unidirectionally loaded membrane shell. The paper closes with an example considering tapered beams, showing how to find a statically possible stress distribution in trapezioidal plates relying on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for rectangular beams.</description>
