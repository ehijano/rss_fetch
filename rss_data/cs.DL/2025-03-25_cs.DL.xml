      <title>National Academic Depository: A Step Towards Digital India Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Academic Depository of India is a distinctive, novel and progressive step visualized by Ministry of Human Resources Development, Govt. of India towards maintaining a database to hold the academic awards issued by Educational Institutions in an electronic and digital form. NAD promises to abolish the difficulties / inefficiencies of collecting, maintaining, and presenting physical paper certificates that can be easily copied / created and the verification processes which are costly, time consuming and disorganized. The depository can eradicate the need to store academic awards in physical form. It can verify the awards issued by different Institutions to the students in an easy way. The secure digital depository is a good proposal to do away with fake and forged certificates. The concept of academic depository is identical to the concept of financial securities. The pilot project is successfully completed with the help of Central Board of Secondary Education and some universities. In order to become fully functional, the depository has to conquer a few challenges with respect to academic diversities in terms of duration of courses and equivalence. National Academic Depository is a revolutionary effort towards the vision of Digital India.</description>

      <title>Can news and social media attention reduce the influence of problematic research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News and social media are widely used to disseminate science, but do they also help raise awareness of problems in research? This study investigates whether high levels of news and social media attention might accelerate the retraction process and increase the visibility of retracted articles. To explore this, we analyzed 15,642 news mentions, 6,588 blog mentions, and 404,082 X mentions related to 15,461 retracted articles. Articles receiving high levels of news and X mentions were retracted more quickly than non-mentioned articles in the same broad field and with comparable publication years, author impact, and journal impact. However, this effect was not statistically signicant for articles with high levels of blog mentions. Notably, articles frequently mentioned in the news experienced a significant increase in annual citation rates after their retraction, possibly because media exposure enhances the visibility of retracted articles, making them more likely to be cited. These findings suggest that increased public scrutiny can improve the efficiency of scientific self-correction, although mitigating the influence of retracted articles remains a gradual process.</description>

      <title>Research impact evaluation based on effective authorship contribution sensitivity: h-leadership index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of a researcher's performance has traditionally relied on various bibliometric measures, with the h-index being one of the most prominent. However, the h-index only accounts for the number of citations received in a publication and does not account for other factors such as the number of authors or their specific contributions in collaborative works. Therefore, the h-index has been placed on scrutiny as it has motivated academic integrity issues where non-contributing authors get authorship merely for raising their h-index. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate existing metrics in their ability to account for authorship contribution by their position and introduce a novel variant of the h-index, known as the h-leadership index. The h-leadership index aims to advance the fair evaluation of academic contributions in multi-authored publications by giving importance to authorship position beyond the first and last authors, focused by Stanford's ranking of the top 2 \% of world scientists. We assign weighted citations based on a modified complementary unit Gaussian curve, ensuring that the contributions of middle authors are appropriately recognised. We apply the h-leadership index to analyse the top 50 researchers across the Group of 8 (Go8) universities in Australia, demonstrating its potential to provide a more balanced assessment of research performance. We provide open-source software for extending the work further.</description>

      <title>Trends in Open Access Academic Outputs of State Agricultural Universities in India: Patterns from OpenAlex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The study examines the Open Access (OA) landscape of Indian state agricultural universities, focusing on OA growth, leading institutions, prolific authors, preferred sources, funding, APC usage, and trending topics. It aims to identify research gaps, guide future research, and support policymakers in developing effective OA policies Design/methodology/approach The experiment utilized the OpenAlex database to collect global open access (OA) publications from Indian state agricultural universities over the past ten years (2014-2023). Using the Research Organization Registry ID, 97,536 publications were extracted. Data analysis was performed with OpenRefine, and ArcGIS 10.8 and Microsoft Excel were used for visualization. Findings: The global OA research output from state agricultural universities amounted to 65,889 publications across five OA categories: Green OA (7.35%), Diamond OA (6.74%), Gold OA (57.27%), Hybrid OA (9.24%), and Bronze OA (19.41%). Notably, 78.34% of articles were published in 864 low-impact domestic journals. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University produced the most publications in Gold, Diamond, Hybrid, and Bronze OA categories, while Punjab Agricultural University excelled in Green OA and received the highest funding, incurring the most article processing charges (APCs). Collaborative research focusing on agricultural policies, rice water management, soil fertility, and crop productivity had a greater impact. Originality/value The experiment is the first effort to evaluate the OA global academic research outputs of Indian state agriculture universities. The findings offer institutions, state governments, and funding agencies the opportunity to prioritise open-access publishing to promote sustainable agricultural research. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to the publications data indexed in the OpenAlex database.</description>

      <title>The European research elite: a cross-national study of highly productive academics in 11 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a rare scholarly theme of highly productive academics, statistically confirming their pivotal role in knowledge production across 11 systems studied. The upper 10 % of highly productive academics in 11 European countries studied (N=17,211) provide on average almost half of all academic knowledge production. In contrast to dominating bibliometric studies of research productivity, we focus on academic attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions as predictors of becoming research top performers across European systems. Our paper provides a (large-scale and cross-country) corroboration of the systematic inequality in knowledge production, for the first time argued for by Lotka and de Solla Price. We corroborate the deep academic inequality in science and explore this segment of the academic profession. The European research elite is a highly homogeneous group of academics whose high research performance is driven by structurally similar factors, mostly individual rather than institutional. Highly productive academics are similar from a cross-national perspective, and they substantially differ intra-nationally from their lower-performing colleagues.</description>

      <title>SciClaims: An End-to-End Generative System for Biomedical Claim Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validating key claims in scientific literature, particularly in biomedical research, is essential for ensuring accuracy and advancing knowledge. This process is critical in sectors like the pharmaceutical industry, where rapid scientific progress requires automation and deep domain expertise. However, current solutions have significant limitations. They lack end-to-end pipelines encompassing all claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verification steps; rely on complex NLP and information retrieval pipelines prone to multiple failure points; and often fail to provide clear, user-friendly justifications for claim verification outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce SciClaims, an advanced system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) that seamlessly integrates the entire scientific claim analysis process. SciClaims outperforms previous approaches in both claim extraction and verification without requiring additional fine-tuning, setting a new benchmark for automated scientific claim analysis.</description>

      <title>The emojification of sentiment on social media: Collection and analysis of a longitudinal Twitter sentiment dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media, as a means for computer-mediated communication, has been extensively used to study the sentiment expressed by users around events or topics. There is however a gap in the longitudinal study of how sentiment evolved in social media over the years. To fill this gap, we develop TM-Senti, a new large-scale, distantly supervised Twitter sentiment dataset with over 184 million tweets and covering a time period of over seven years. We describe and assess our methodology to put together a large-scale, emoticon- and emoji-based labelled sentiment analysis dataset, along with an analysis of the resulting dataset. Our analysis highlights interesting temporal changes, among others in the increasing use of emojis over emoticons. We publicly release the dataset for further research in tasks including sentiment analysis and text classification of tweets. The dataset can be fully rehydrated including tweet metadata and without missing tweets thanks to the archive of tweets publicly available on the Internet Archive, which the dataset is based on.</description>

      <title>Expertise diversity of teams predicts originality and long-term impact in science and technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of teams in producing innovative and high-impact science and technology, it remains unclear how expertise diversity among team members relates to the originality and impact of the work they produce. Here, we develop a new method to quantify the expertise distance of researchers based on their prior career histories and apply it to 23 million scientific publications and 4 million patents. We find that across science and technology, expertise-diverse teams tend to produce work with greater originality. Teams with more diverse expertise have no significant impact advantage in the short- (2 years) or mid-term (5 years). Instead, they exhibit substantially higher long-term impact (10 years), increasingly attracting larger cross-disciplinary influence. This impact premium of expertise diversity among team members becomes especially pronounced when other dimensions of team diversity are missing, as teams within the same institution or country appear to disproportionately reap the benefits of expertise diversity. While gender-diverse teams have relatively higher impact on average, teams with varied levels of gender diversity all seem to benefit from increased expertise diversity. Given the growing knowledge demands on individual researchers, implementation of incentives for original research, and the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term impacts, these results may have implications for funding, assembling, and retaining teams with originality and long-lasting impacts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity. Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13 metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics. Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis, this file presents approximately one hundred million calculated paper-patent similarity pairs to enhance understanding of how theoretical advancements translate into commercial technologies. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.</description>
