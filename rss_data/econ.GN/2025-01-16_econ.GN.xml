      <title>The Response of Farmer Welfares Amidst Food Prices Shock and Inflation in the Province of East Java</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Price uncertainty in food commodities can create uncertainty for farmers and potentially negatively impact the level of farmer household well-being. On the other hand, the agriculture sector in the province of East Java has greatly contributed to East Java's economy. This paper analyses the response of farmer welfare through farmer exchange values amidst fluctuation shock of food needed prices and inflation level in the east java province. The research method of this paper employs the impulse response function of the Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model by using time series secondary data from May 2017 until December 2023. This paper finds that the shock that happens to aggregate food prices can increase farmer exchange values even though the shock to the inflation level has reduced farmer exchange values and increased aggregate food prices.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study on the Factors Influencing Stock Market Volatility in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly utilizes the ARDL model and principal component analysis to investigate the relationship between the volatility of China's Shanghai Composite Index returns and the variables of exchange rate and domestic and foreign bond yields in an internationally integrated stock market. This paper uses a daily data set for the period from July 1, 2010 to April 30, 2024, in which the dependent variable is the Shanghai Composite Index return, and the main independent variables are the spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar, the 10-year treasury bond yields in China and the United States and their lagged variables, with the effect of the time factor added. Firstly, the development of the stock, foreign exchange and bond markets and the basic theories are reviewed, and then each variable is analyzed by descriptive statistics, the correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable is expanded theoretically, and the corresponding empirical analyses are briefly introduced, and then the empirical analyses and modeling of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable are carried out on the basis of the theoretical foundations mentioned above with the support of the daily data, and the model conclusions are analyzed economically through a large number of tests, then the model conclusions are analyzed economically. economic analysis of the model conclusions, and finally, the author proposes three suggestions to enhance the stability and return of the Chinese stock market, respectively.

      <title>The Cost of Delivery Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2018, there has been a consistent decline in the distance traveled by U.S. manufacturing imports, reaching a level not observed since 2008. This trend is the result of the substitution away from imports from China and towards imports from closer countries. At the same time, U.S. manufacturing inventory-to-sales ratio has continued to rise. These trends are at odds with the literature, which finds that reductions in the distance of imports are associated with a decline in inventories. We argue that a rise in delivery time risk, driven by longer and more frequent delays and supply disruptions, can reconcile these trends. We do so in the context of a model of global sourcing with stochastic delivery times and inventories. Firms trade off the lower price of farther inputs with the increase in exposure to demand volatility and longer delays. In response, firms increase their inventories. Yet, as delivery delays rise, firms need to carry more inventories per unit of the input used. We calibrate the model for the period from 2018 to 2024 using data on the increase in tariffs for inputs from China, and the rise in inventories over sales. We find an increase in delivery delays for foreign inputs of 21 days across the period. The rise in delays and tariffs had an output loss of 7.3% and a price increase of 1.8%. Of these, the rise in delivery delays alone generated a 2.6% drop in output and a 0.4% increase in prices.</description>

      <title>Discretionary vs nondiscretionary in fiscal mechanism. Non-automatic fiscal stabilisers vs automatic fiscal stabilisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present study is to increase the intelligibility of macroeconomic phenomena triggered by governmental intervention in economy by means of fiscal policies. During cyclical movements, fiscal policy can play an important role in order to help stabilise the economy. But discretionary policy usually implies implementation lags and is not automatically reversed when economic conditions change. In contrast, automatic fiscal stabilisers (SFA) ensure a prompter, and self-correcting fiscal response. The present study aims to tackle the topic of discretionary vs nondiscretionary characteristic of fiscal stabilisers (SF). In this context, the scope of the research undertaking is to launch a scientific debate over the definitions of the concepts of non-automatic fiscal stabilisers (SfnA) and SFAs. We describe how we can quantify the discretionary and non-discretionary character of the fiscal policy, by the analysis of the structure of the conventional budget balance (SBc), budget balance associated with the current GDP. In the final part of this article, we propose a quantitative equilibrium model for establishing the mathematical prerequisites for an SF to become automatic. Likewise, on the basis of the proposed mathematical model we have performed a qualitative analysis of the influence factors.</description>

      <title>Profit Shifting and International Tax Reforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: International taxation rules are outdated, allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens. This paper examines how tax reforms affect profit shifting and cross-country welfare. We propose a model that separates real economic profits from paper profits, introducing 'triangle identities' to estimate bilateral profit-shifting flows. Using macro- and firm-level data, paper profits' elasticity is three times that of the tax base. Global minimum tax reforms improve welfare by increasing public goods funding and reducing tax competition. We also identify optimal minimum rates under various taxing-right scenarios and demonstrate that unilateral destination-based-cash-flow-tax reforms' welfare effects depend highly on trade imbalances.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. Existing policy instruments have so far proven insufficient in halting this decline, which raises the need to explore the possible feedback loops that are pivotal to ecosystem degradation. We design a minimal integrated bio-economic agent-based model to qualitatively explore macro-level biodiversity trends, as influenced by individual farmer behavior within simple decision-making processes. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Seesaw Experimentation: A/B Tests with Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02085v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how spillover effects in A/B testing can impede organizational progress and develops strategies for mitigating these challenges. We identify a phenomenon termed ``seesaw experimentation'', where a firm's overall performance paradoxically deteriorates despite achieving continuous improvements in measured A/B testing metrics. Seesaw experimentation arises when successful innovations in primary metrics generate negative externalities in secondary, unmeasured dimensions. To address this problem, we propose implementing a positive hurdle rate for A/B test approval. We derive the optimal hurdle rate, offering a simple solution that preserves decentralized experimentation while mitigating negative spillovers.</description>
