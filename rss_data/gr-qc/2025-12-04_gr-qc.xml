      <title>Tau--Function Multilinear Hierarchy of the Tomimatsu--Sato Spacetime: A Gravitational Realization of the YTSF Integrable Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tomimatsu--Sato (TS) family generalizes the Kerr black hole to higher multipole order $\delta$ and has long been regarded as algebraically complicated without any clear integrability. We show instead that stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations, when the Ernst potential is written as a $\tau$--ratio $\mathcal{E}=\tau_1/\tau_0$, admit a universal decomposition of the Ernst numerator into a cubic part containing all second derivatives and a quartic \emph{gradient envelope}. The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $\delta=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel. Thus the TS geometry forms a gravitational realization of a multilinear $\tau$--function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity.</description>

      <title>Probing for primordial black hole candidates in exoplanet search data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have sifted through astrophysical data collected by various radial velocity and gravitational microlensing searches for exoplanets with the goal of identifying potential signs of the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). Our motivation is that those hypothesized remnants of inhomogeneous energetic fluctuations in the early universe, though too small for direct detection, are thought to have a mass range similar to that of planets. Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit). We also examine the microlensing events MOA 2009-BLG-387L and OGLE-2016-BLG-1540, which offer promise as candidate PBHs. We present these as a representative, but not exclusive list, of potential PBH contenders. Furthermore, future imaging, especially focused on signals of planetary dimensions versus evaporation signatures, might clarify which of these are indeed exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Inferring black hole formation channels in GWTC-4.0 via parametric mass-spin correlations derived from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the differences between several proposed formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs), including isolated stellar evolution, dynamical assembly in dense clusters and AGN disks, and primordial BHs. Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events.</description>

      <title>From scalar clouds around evaporating black holes to boson star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the evolution of a scalar cloud bound to an evaporating black hole. Our simulations of the associated Schr\"odinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Many Worlds in Theory Space: A Quantum Origin for the Constants of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics, such as the strength of electromagnetism or the masses of elementary particles, must lie in precise ranges for stars, planets, and chemistry to exist. Why the universe has such these values is one of the deepest questions in science. Here we propose that these constants arise from quantum mechanics itself. By enlarging the configuration space of quantum cosmology, we treat the constants of nature as part of the wavefunction of the universe. The universal wavefunction contains support for many possible sets of constants, and early-universe processes cause these possibilities to decohere into distinct classical universes. Our universe is one such branch, compatible with complexity and life. We defined the Grand Hilbert Space as the direct sum of U-sectors, each representing a distinct set of physical laws. We derived the Meta-Wheeler--DeWitt equation, which governs the dynamics of the theory parameters. We showed that in the Planck era, the kinetic terms for these parameters are active, creating a state of primordial coherence where the laws of physics effectively fluctuate. This formalism offers a quantitative tool for high-energy physics. We proposed that the total integrated amplitude over theory space serves as a Bayesian evidence metric, allowing for the statistical comparison of rival microscopic theories based on their fertility in generating habitable sectors. Finally, this work makes a specific, falsifiable prediction: there will never be a successful, purely mathematical derivation of the Standard Model parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Reversing the Thermodynamic Arrow of Time from Black Hole Thermodynamics, Wormholes, and Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the thermodynamic arrow of time in a single universe be reversed, even temporarily, within semiclassical gravity without invoking additional universes or branches? We address this question in a single, connected spacetime where quantum field theory is coupled to classical general relativity, and where black holes, traversable wormholes, and time-symmetric or retrocausal formulations of quantum mechanics might naively appear to open channels for entropy export or cancellation. After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language. We then introduce a "Global Entropy Transport" (GET) framework and derive a sectoral inequality that bounds the net decrease of matter-plus-radiation entropy in terms of changes in horizon area and correlation (mutual-information) terms, assuming the generalized second law and modern focusing and energy conditions. Within this framework, black holes, wormholes, and retrocausal protocols can at most redistribute entropy among matter, radiation, and gravitational sectors and reshape the local pattern of entropy production. They do not, under current semiclassical, holographic, and statistical-mechanical constraints, permit a genuine reversal of the universal thermodynamic arrow in a single connected universe.</description>

      <title>Motion of a charged test particle around a static black hole in a monopole magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of a charged test particle in the spacetime with a spherically symmetric black hole which is immersed in a monopole magnetic field. We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe analysis of strong-field effects in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</description>

      <title>Feeding a Kerr black hole with quantized vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By solving a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in Kerr geometry, we uncover new phenomena and key characteristics of quantized vortices in quantum fluids near a Kerr black hole. The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion onto higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain relativistic solutions of spherically symmetric accretion by a dynamical analysis of a generalised Hamiltonian for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) Black Hole (BH). We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D&gt;4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH.</description>

      <title>A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework for black-hole spectroscopy: a case study on GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $\zeta$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $\zeta$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $\zeta$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics tested on the three-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations of celestial systems are based on approximations or modifications of classical dynamics. The approximations are with ``particle-mesh'' (PM) substitutions of the attractions from objects far away, or one modify the Newtonian accelerations (MOND) or the gravities (MOGA). The PM approximation and MOND modification of classical dynamics break the invariances of classical dynamics. The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law. Although the errors and shortcomings of these PM approximations and MOND modifications are small, they cause the instability of the regular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Some perspective of thermodynamical and optical properties of black holes in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the massive parameters ($\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($\alpha$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($\eta_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.</description>

      <title>Fractional Holographic Dark Energy Driven Reconstruction of $f(Q)$ Gravity and its Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe, we present a reconstructed version of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory in this work, which is inspired by the integrating the fractional holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff. This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $\chi^2_{\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. With current $q(0) \in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\text{tr}} \sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. While the $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating that the model is not $\Lambda$CDM, the effective equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$ stays within the quintessence regime ($-1 &lt; \omega_{\text{eff}} &lt; -1/3$). The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework.</description>

      <title>Shadow geometry of Kerr MOG naked singularity and analysis of accretion disk luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical entities featuring gravitational singularities without event horizons. In this study, we analyze the shadow properties of Kerr Modified Gravity (Kerr MOG) naked singularities (KMNSs). We show that the KMNS shadow can appear closed, open, or even vanish, depending on the dimensionless spin parameter a, the modified gravity parameter alpha, and the observer's inclination angle. We identify the critical conditions under which the KMNS shadow develops a gap, a unique feature not present in BH shadows. We analyze the properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding a KMNS, within the framework of MOG characterized by the parameter alpha. The study includes a detailed examination of the spacetime geometry and the equations of motion for test particles. In addition, we adopt a simplified model for the disk's radiative flux, temperature distribution, and spectral luminosity. Our analysis primarily focuses on the flux distribution of the accretion disk around KMNS with identical mass but varying spin and MOG deformation parameters. This allows us to explore how modifications in rotation and the MOG parameter alpha influence the radiative properties of the disk. Further, these observational signatures may serve as effective tools for clearly distinguishing KMNS from standard Kerr naked singularities (KNSs), where the MOG parameter alpha = 0</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Birefringence in a de Sitter Background with Chern-Simons Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Topological Einstein gravity as Kodaira-Spencer gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a contribution towards quantizing three-dimensional gravity, we show at the classical level that Euclidean three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant is uplifted to the $SU(2)$-invariant sector of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Kodaira-Spencer gravity appears in the target space description of the B-model topological string theory and describes deformations of a complex structure. We prove that given a reference solution of Einstein gravity in the first-order formulation, a second off-shell configuration uplifts to a unique complex structure deformation in six dimensions. If the configuration satisfies Einstein's equations, the complex structure deformation is integrable, i.e. a solution of Kodaira-Spencer gravity. We demonstrate the uplift explicitly for Ba\~nados solutions. Our construction embeds three-dimensional gravity into topological string theory and AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality into twisted holography.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Saddle in Euclidean IKKT Matrix Model and Its Effective Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equation of motion of the Euclidean IKKT matrix model, and realize a new type of classical saddle that only exists in $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Under the assumption that the matrices are the generators of $\mathfrak{so}(n,m)$, we identify a unique solution, that is, $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Even though it has $6$ generators and thus $6$ non-zero matrices, they are not independent due to the $2$ Casimir constraints in $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure and the Casimir constraints, we derive the effective metric that a test probe propagates on. The resulting effective metric exhibits an $SO(3)$ symmetry, matching the spatial symmetry of our universe.</description>

      <title>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</description>

      <title>EFT of Dark Energy with Cosmic Chronometers: Reconstructing Background EFT Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a model-independent framework for studying cosmology within scalar-tensor theories. In this work, we explore how the time evolution of the cosmological background, inferred from cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter, can be used to reconstruct the relevant EFT functions. Our approach enables the direct determination of these EFT functions from observational data without assuming any specific cosmological model. This makes it possible to test the background evolution of a wide range of dark energy models, including the $\Lambda$CDM model. We further demonstrate how the reconstructed EFT functions can be applied to constrain concrete theories, such as the quintessence model.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of noise transients observed in LIGO data during the first part of the fourth observing run, using the unsupervised machine learning technique t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to examine the behavior of glitch groups. Based on the t-SNE output, we apply Agglomerative Clustering in combination with the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of groups. We then track these groups over time and investigate correlations between their occurrence and environmental or instrumental conditions. At the Livingston observatory, the most common glitches during O4a were seasonal and associated with ground motion, whereas at Hanford, the most prevalent glitches were related to instrumental conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Preserving High-Order Compact OEDG Method for Spherically Symmetric Einstein-Euler System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Euler (EE) system faces severe challenges due to the stringent physical admissibility constraints of relativistic fluids and the geometric singularities inherent in metric evolution. This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves.</description>

Abstract: There is tentative evidence for a mismatch between the rest frames of matter and the cosmic microwave background, the "quasar dipole anomaly". We consider such a dipole in tilted anisotropic models, for a range of scenarios and sources: spatial curvature, cosmic heat flux, large scale electromagnetic fields and a Khronon field. Crucially, we determine the ancillary effects on other cosmological observables in each of these models and we show that, apart from the case of the Khronon field, it is unlikely that one can obtain a dipole with the amplitude that is being observed unless one considers additional exotica.</description>

      <title>The anisotropy and magnetic field structure of neutron stars through gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how gravitational wave (GW) observations can probe the internal physics of neutron stars by extending the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff framework to include pressure anisotropy and internal magnetic fields. Two representative magnetic field configurations, radial orientation dominated (RO) and transverse orientation dominated (TO), are implemented with strength and decay prescriptions. We found that both anisotropy and magnetic fields increase the maximum supported mass and modify the tidal deformability $\Lambda$, thereby imprinting measurable signatures on GW signals. For the equal mass binary ($1.2M_\odot$-$1.2M_\odot$), anisotropy neutron star with RO magnetic field yield more compact stars and a larger shift in $\Lambda$, allowing discrimination at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as $\sim18$ using the O4 power spectra density. TO fields produce weaker effects and require substantially higher SNRs for detection. In conclusion, we conclude that gravitational waves are capable of probing the internal structure of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Primary gravitational waves at high frequencies I: Origin of suppression in the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The primary gravitational waves (PGWs) are generated in the early universe from the quantum vacuum during inflation. In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love Numbers for Black Holes and Beyond from Shell Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a novel effective field theory for a compact body coupled to gravity, whose key feature is that the dynamics of gravitational perturbations is explicitly determined by known solutions in black hole perturbation theory in four dimensions. In this way, the physics of gravitational perturbations in curved space are already encoded in the effective field theory, thus bypassing the need for the higher-order calculations that constitute a major hurdle in standard approaches. Concretely, we model the compact body as a spherical shell, whose finite size regulates short-distance divergences in four dimensions and whose tidal responses are described by higher-dimensional operators. As an application, we consider scalar perturbations and derive new results for scalar Love numbers through ${\cal O} (G^9)$ for Schwarzschild black holes and for generic compact bodies. Finally, our analysis reveals an intriguing structure of the scalar black-hole Love numbers in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which we conjecture to hold to all orders.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of shear viscosity on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves (pGW) after inflation. Without assuming a specific inflationary scenario we focus on the evolution of pGWs after they re-enter the horizon during a cosmological epoch characterized by the presence of shear viscosity. We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $\Omega_\text{GW}\sim k^{n_\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider a beam summation method adapted from the semiclassical regime of quantum mechanics to study the classical properties of thin light bundles in gravity. In Newtonian paraxial optics, this method has been shown to encapsulate the wave properties of the light beams. In our case, the wave function assigned to the light bundle can be viewed as a coarse-grained description that captures information about the dynamics of superposed bundles within the geometric optics regime. We investigate two solutions of the null bundle wave function that differ by their origin: (i) a point source and (ii) a finite source. It is shown that while the wave function in the point source case contains the same information as the standard thin null bundle framework, the finite source case corresponds to a Gaussian beam. The novel aspect of this work arises from our geometric construction of covariant Gaussian beams, which can be applied in any spacetime. Additionally, the effects of a finite source on cosmological distances are discussed. With this framework, one can model light propagation from coherent sources while avoiding the mathematical singularities of the standard thin null bundle formalism. We explicitly demonstrate the caustic-avoidance property of Gaussian beams in the analytically tractable example of a Barriola-Vilenkin monopole spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>

Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic background gravitational waves have not yet been detected by ground-based laser interferometric detectors, but recent improvements in detector sensitivity have raised considerable expectations for their eventual detection. Previous studies have introduced methods for exploring anisotropic background gravitational waves using Bayesian statistics. These studies represent a groundbreaking approach by offering physically motivated anisotropy mapping that is distinct from the Singular Value Decomposition regularization of the Fisher Information Matrix. However, they are limited by the use of a single model, which can introduce potential bias when dealing with complex data that may consist of a mixture of multiple models. Here, we demonstrate the bias introduced by a single-component model approach in the parametric interpretation of anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds, and we confirm that using multiple-component models can mitigate this bias.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</description>

      <title>Unified equation for massless spin fields and new definitions of key spin coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals or exploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves, black hole perturbation theory proves indispensable. At the heart of developing a universal perturbation framework for such problems lies the challenge of formulating a coordinate-independent, unified wave equation that is universally applicable to any black hole spacetime. This paper resolves this central issue in type-D spacetimes by establishing a new definition of spin coefficients. Specifically, we introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\rho$, $\mu$, $\tau$, and $\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of the logarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\mu}$, $n^{\mu}$, $m^{\mu}$, $\bar{m}^{\mu}$), respectively. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. Using the newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary type-D black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This finding is particularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is already a significant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate spacetime around black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new definition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the unified equation for nearly all known type-D black hole backgrounds. This lays a solid foundation not only for studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals but also for exploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves in any type-D black hole background.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the general conditions for modulus stabilization in a warped braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory. We identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to enable stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.</description>

Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model that shows the linear dependence of the entropy density on the temperature. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic baryon census with fast radio bursts and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic baryon density fraction ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) is intrinsically correlated with the Hubble constant ($H_0$) through the critical density of the Universe. In the context of the decade-long $H_0$ tension, the significant discrepancy between early- and late-Universe measurements of $H_0$ implies that fixing its value or imposing an external prior could bias the baryon census. To address this concern, we construct a late-Universe probe framework that unifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, which can respectively resolve the missing baryon problem and the $H_0$ tension through their dispersion measures and absolute luminosity distances. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain an $H_0$-free measurement of $\Omega_{\rm b}=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of fragmentation on the cosmic string loop number density, using an approach inspired by the three-scale model and a Boltzmann equation. We build a new formulation designed to be more amenable to numerical resolution and present two complementary numerical methods to obtain the full loop distribution including the effect of fragmentation and gravitational radiation. We show that fragmentation generically predicts a decay of the loop number density on large scales and a deviation from a pure power-law. We expect fragmentation to be crucial for the calibration of loop distribution models.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of fractional calculus to model stellar dynamics, focusing on Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard theories use the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, restricted to Gaussian processes under the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). We argue this is inadequate for RR. We demonstrate that gravitational interactions inherently produce infinite variance in stochastic torques, violating the CLT. Consequently, RR is governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) and constitutes a superdiffusive L\'{e}vy flight. We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local operators, to explore resolutions to observational discrepancies. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts immediate, linear flux ($\Gamma(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict significant exponential delay. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically that non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping,'' bypassing bottlenecks like the Schwarzschild Barrier (SB), which local models interpret as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We present proof-of-concept $N$-body simulations that confirm non-local RR transport, although the resolution must be improved to rule out enhanced Two-Body Relaxation in the small-N setup. The fractional framework offers a compelling alternative description for non-local transport, potentially resolving TDE and EMRI rate questions.</description>

      <title>Probing the disk-jet coupling in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A four-dimensional gauge--gravity unification based on the local $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry is developed in a universal Yang--Mills-type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields, and their invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model-type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ down to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})\times SU(N)$, effectively filtering out unobserved non-compact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector for all gauge fields involved, while an Einstein--Cartan linear-curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. The matter sector points to a deeper elementarity of $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $SL(16,\mathbb{C})$, accommodating precisely three composite quark--lepton families. The theory thus links non-compact unification, induced gravity, and fermion family structure within a single framework.</description>
