      <title>Spatial locking of chimera states to frequency heterogeneity in nonlocally coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimera states in systems of nonlocally coupled oscillators, i.e., self-organized coexistence of coherent and incoherent oscillator populations, have attracted much attention. In this study, we consider the effect of frequency heterogeneities on the chimera state and reveal that it induces spatial locking of the chimera state, i.e., the coherent and incoherent domains align with lower and higher frequency regions, respectively, in a self-adaptive manner. Using an extended self-consistency approach, we show that such spatially locked chimera states can be reproduced as steady solutions of the system in the continuum limit. Furthermore, we develop a variational argument to explain the mechanism leading to spatial locking. Our analysis reveals how heterogeneity can affect the collective dynamics of the chimera states and offers insights into their control and applications.</description>

      <title>Entropic analysis of a hierarchically organized Axelrod model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchically organized patterns are ubiquitously found in complex systems. However, this point is frequently misrepresented in many Sociophysics models, mainly because random initial conditions are by far the most assumed in the literature. In this article, we studied a simple and quasi-aparametric Axelrod model of culture dynamics assuming structured (hierarchically organized) initial conditions. As a first remarkable point, the maximum final culture branching is observed to correspond to a highest uncontrollability regime of an entropy based framework described before. Also, this model shows a quantization of culture patterns that can be explained with the aid of that formalism.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>

      <title>Experiments with an oscillator based Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03167v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in non-algorithmic, unconventional computing is rising in recent years due to more and more apparent short comings of classic stored-program digital computers, such as energy efficiency, degree of parallelism in computations, clock frequency limitations, integration density, silicon utilization, etc. One notable such unconventional approach are oscillator based Ising machines, i.e., systems consisting of a number of oscillators which can be coupled in order to create an analogue for some problem to be solved, while the actual information is encoded in the phase relationships of these oscillators with respect to some reference (typically one of these oscillators). It has been shown that machines of this type are capable of solving NP-hard problems such as max-cut, etc. In the following an experimental Ising machine is presented together with experimental results obtained from this machine.</description>

      <title>Cohesive urban bicycle infrastructure design through optimal transport routing in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bicycle infrastructure networks must meet the needs of cyclists to position cycling as a viable transportation choice in cities. In particular, protected infrastructure should be planned cohesively for the whole city and spacious enough to accommodate all cyclists safely and prevent cyclist congestion -- a common problem in cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we devise an adaptive method for optimal bicycle network design and for evaluating congestion criticalities on bicycle paths. The method goes beyond static network measures, using computationally efficient adaptation rules inspired by Optimal Transport on the dynamically updating multilayer network of roads and protected bicycle lanes. Street capacities and cyclist flows reciprocally control each other to optimally accommodate cyclists on streets with one control parameter that dictates the preference of bicycle infrastructure over roads. Applying our method to Copenhagen confirms that the city's bicycle network is generally well-developed. However, we are able to identify the network's bottlenecks, and we find, at a finer scale, disparities in network accessibility and criticalities between different neighborhoods. Our model and results are generalizable beyond this particular case study to serve as a scalable and versatile tool for aiding urban planners in designing cycling-friendly cities.</description>
