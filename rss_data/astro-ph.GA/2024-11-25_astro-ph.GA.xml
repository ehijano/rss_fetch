      <title>Citizen Science Identification of Isolated Blue Stellar Systems in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 35 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity--projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of o-H$_2$D$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$ during the high-mass star formation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is a well-established evolutionary tracer in low-mass star formation, but its applicability to the high-mass regime remains an open question. The abundances and ratios of deuterated species have often been proposed as reliable evolutionary indicators for different stages of the high-mass star formation. We investigate the role of N$_2$H$^+$ and key deuterated molecules as tracers of the different stages of the high-mass star formation, and test whether their abundance ratios can serve as reliable evolutionary indicators. We conducted APEX observations of o-H$_2$D$^+$ (1$_{10}$-1$_{11}$), N$_2$H$^+$ (4-3), and N$_2$d$^+$ (3-2) in 40 high-mass clumps at different evolutionary stages, selected from the ATLASGAL survey. Molecular column densities ($N$) and abundances ($X$), were derived through spectral line modelling, both under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE conditions. The $N$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) show the smallest deviation from LTE results when derived under non-LTE assumptions. In contrast, N$_2$D$^+$ shows the largest discrepancy between the $N$ derived from LTE and non-LTE. In all the cases discussed, we found that $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) decreases more significantly with time than in the case of $X$(N$_2$D$^+$); whereas $X$(N$_2$H$^+$) increases slightly. Therefore, the validity of the recently proposed $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$)/$X$(N$_2$D$^+$) ratio as a reliable evolutionary indicator was not observed for this sample. While the deuteration fraction derived from N$_2$D$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$ clearly decreases with clump evolution, the interpretation of this trend is complex, given the different distribution of the two tracers. Our results suggest that a careful consideration of the observational biases and beam-dilution effects are crucial for an accurate interpretation of the evolution of the deuteration process during the high-mass star formation process.</description>

      <title>Hitting the slopes: A spectroscopic view of UV continuum slopes of galaxies reveals a reddening at z &gt; 9.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV continuum slope of galaxies, $\beta$, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of $\beta$ and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present $\beta$ measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $5.5&lt;z&lt;14.3$ selected primarily from JADES, where $\beta$ has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median $\beta=-2.3$ across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of $\beta$ with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average $\beta$ at $z &gt; 9.5$ to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at $z &lt; 9.5$. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and $\beta$, we derive trends between $\beta$ and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer $\beta$ values. We further report six galaxies with $\beta&lt;-3.0$, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder $\beta$ values at $z &gt; 9.5$ may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at $T &gt; 15,000$ K can reproduce the range of $\beta$ that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed $\beta$ values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies with Radio-excess AGNs in the VLA Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using recent observations taken by the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). To select these objects, we first establish a criterion to identify radio-excess AGNs using the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) parameter, $q$, that describes the tight relation between radio and IR emission in star forming (SF) galaxies. We find a $2\sigma$ threshold of $q &lt; 1.94$ to select radio-excess AGNs, which is derived from a sample of $\sim 7,000$ galaxies across the full mass range in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) that have radio and IR detections from VLASS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively. We create catalogs of radio-excess AGNs and SF galaxies and make these available to the community. Applying our criterion to dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \lesssim 3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ and redshifts $z \le 0.15$, and carefully removing interlopers, we find 10 radio-excess AGNs with radio-optical positional offsets between $\sim$ 0 and 2.3 arcseconds (0 - 2.7 kpc). Based on statistical arguments and emission line diagnostics, we expect the majority of these radio-excess AGNs to be associated with the dwarf host galaxies rather than background AGNs. Five of the objects have evidence for hosting AGNs at other wavelengths, and 5 objects are identified as AGNs in dwarf galaxies for the first time. We also identify 8 variable radio sources in dwarf galaxies by comparing the VLASS epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations to FIRST detections presented in arXiv:1909.04670.</description>

      <title>MAGAZ3NE: Evidence for Galactic Conformity in $z\gtrsim3$ Protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the quiescent fractions of massive galaxies in six $z\gtrsim3$ spectroscopically-confirmed protoclusters in the COSMOS field, one of which is newly confirmed and presented here. We report the spectroscopic confirmation of MAGAZ3NE~J100143+023021 at $z=3.122^{+0.007}_{-0.004}$ by the Massive Ancient Galaxies At $z&gt;3$ NEar-infrared (MAGAZ3NE) survey. MAGAZ3NE~J100143+023021 contains a total of 79 protocluster members (28 spectroscopic and 51 photometric). Three spectroscopically-confirmed members are star-forming ultra-massive galaxies ($\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_\odot)&gt;11$; UMGs), the most massive of which has $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_\odot)=11.15^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. Combining Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy and the COSMOS2020 photometric catalog, we use a weighted Gaussian kernel density estimator to map the protocluster and measure its total mass $2.25^{+1.55}_{-0.65}\times10^{14}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ in the dense ``core'' region. For each of the six COSMOS protoclusters, we compare the quiescent fraction to the status of the central UMG as star-forming or quiescent. We observe that galaxies in these protoclusters appear to obey galactic conformity: elevated quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters with $UVJ$ quiescent UMGs and low quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters containing $UVJ$ star-forming UMGs. This correlation of star-formation/quiescence in UMGs and the massive galaxies nearby in these protoclusters is the first evidence for the existence of galactic conformity at $z&gt;3$. Despite disagreements over mechanisms behind conformity at low redshifts, its presence at these early cosmic times would provide strong constraints on the physics proposed to drive galactic conformity.</description>

      <title>Understanding Stellar Mass-Metallicity and Size Relations in Simulated Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing the physical characteristics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) in cosmological simulations is challenging, particularly with respect to stellar metallicity and galaxy size. To investigate these difficulties in detail, we conduct high-resolution simulations ($M_{\rm gas} \sim 60 \, M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm DM} \sim 370 \, M_{\odot}$ ) on six UFD analogs ($M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^8 - 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm \star} \sim 10^3 - 2.1 \times 10^4 \, M_{\odot}$). Our findings reveal that the stellar properties of UFD analogs are shaped by diverse star-forming environments from multiple progenitor halos in the early Universe. Notably, our UFD analogs exhibit a better match to the observed mass-metallicity relation (MZR), showing higher average metallicity compared to other theoretical models. The metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) of our simulated UFDs lack high-metallicity stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -2.0$) while containing low-metallicity stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &lt; -4.0$). Excluding these low-metallicity stars, our results align well with the MDFs of observed UFDs. However, forming stars with higher metallicity ($-2.0 \leq [\rm Fe/H]_{\rm max} \leq -1.5$) remains a challenge due to the difficulty of sustaining metal enrichment during their brief star formation period before cosmic reionization. Additionally, our simulations show extended outer structures in UFDs, resulting from dry mergers between progenitor halos. To ensure consistency, we adopt the same fitting method commonly used in observations to derive the half-light radius. We find that this method tends to produce lower values compared to direct calculations and struggles to accurately describe the extended outer structures. To address this, we employ a two-component density profile to obtain structural parameters, finding that it better describes the galaxy shape, including both inner and outer structures.</description>

      <title>Blue and Green Early-type Galaxies Lack Alignment with Large-scale Filaments, Indicating a Distinct Evolutionary Path from Red Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment of non-red early-type galaxies (ETGs) with blue or green colors within large-scale filaments and compare this alignment pattern with that of red ETGs. Our analysis reveals a significant alignment of the major axes of red ETGs with the orientations of their host cosmic filaments, consistent with prior research. In contrast, non-red ETGs show no significant alignment signal. This divergence in alignment behavior between non-red and red ETGs implies a distinct evolutionary path for non-red ETGs, suggesting a formation process that may be independent of galaxy mergers or that recent mergers experienced by non-red ETGs may not follow the direction of the filament but rather be more random or even perpendicular to the filament orientation.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The star-forming properties of HI selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between atomic gas, the star-formation history of a galaxy and its environment are intrinsically linked, and we need to decouple these dependencies to understand their role in galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper, we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of 187 galaxies from the MIGHTEE-HI Survey Early Science Release data, focusing on the relationships between HI properties and star formation. A strong correlation emerges between a galaxy's HI-to-stellar mass ratio and the time of formation, alongside an inverse correlation between stellar mass and time of formation, regardless of the inferred SFH. Additionally, galaxies with lower stellar masses and higher HI-to-stellar mass ratios exhibit longer gas depletion times compared to more massive galaxies, which appear to have depleted their gas and formed stars more efficiently. This suggests that smaller, gas-rich galaxies have higher depletion times due to shallower potential wells and less efficient star formation. Furthermore, we explore the connection between spin-filament alignment and HI content. We find no significant correlation between peak star formation activity and proximity to filaments. However, we do find that the two galaxies in our sample within 1 Mpc of a filament have very low gas-depletion timescales and have their spin axis misaligned with the filament, suggestive of a link between the galaxy properties and proximity to a filament.</description>

      <title>Untangling Magellanic Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Stream has long been known to contain multiple HI strands and corresponding stellar populations are beginning to be discovered. Combining an H3-selected sample with stars drawn from the Gaia catalog, we trace stars along a sub-dominant strand of the Magellanic Stream, as defined by gas content, across 30$^\circ$ on the sky. We find that the dominant strand is devoid of stars with Galactocentric distance $\lesssim 55$ kpc while the subdominant strand shows a close correspondence to such stars. We conclude that (1) the two Stream strands have different origins, (2) they are likely only close in projection, (3) the subdominant strand is tidal in origin, and (4) the subdominant strand is composed of disk material, likely drawn from the disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission lines from ionized nebulae allow us to determine their physical and chemical properties, along with the interstellar extinction. "pyEQUIB" is a pure Python open-source package including several application programming interface (API) functions that can be employed for plasma diagnostics, abundance analysis of collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL) in nebular astrophysics, and extinction analysis of Balmer lines. This package implements the IDL library "proEQUIB" in Python and couples it with the "AtomNeb" Python package. This package relies on the Python packages NumPy and SciPy. The API functions of this package can be used for studies of ionized nebulae by astronomers who are familiar with the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys are likely to discover a new sample of interstellar objects (ISOs) within the Solar System, but questions remain about the origin and distribution of this population within the Galaxy. ISOs are ejected from their host systems with a range of velocities, spreading out into tidal streams - analogous to the stellar streams routinely observed from the disruption of star clusters and dwarf galaxies. We create a simulation of ISO streams orbiting in the Galaxy, deriving a simple model for their density distribution over time. We then construct a population model to predict the properties of the streams in which the Sun is currently embedded. We find that the number of streams encountered by the Sun is quite large, ~ 10^6 or more. However, the wide range of stream properties means that for reasonable future samples of ISOs observed in the Solar System, we may see ISOs from the same star ("siblings"), and we are likely to see ISOs from the same star cluster ("cousins"). We also find that ISOs are typically not traceable to their parent star, though this may be possible for ISO siblings. Any ISOs observed with a common origin will come from younger, dynamically colder streams.</description>

      <title>RAMSES-yOMP: Performance Optimizations for the Astrophysical Hydrodynamic Simulation Code RAMSES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient code for large, multiscale astrophysical simulations is crucial in preparing the upcoming era of exascale computing. RAMSES is an astrophysical simulation code that employs parallel processing based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, it has limitations in computational and memory efficiency when using a large number of CPU cores. The problem stems from inefficiencies in workload distribution and memory allocation that inevitably occur when a volume is simply decomposed into domains equal to the number of working processors. We present RAMSES-yOMP, which is a modified version of RAMSES designed to improve parallel scalability. Major updates include the incorporation of Open Multi-Processing into the MPI parallelization to take advantage of both the shared and distributed memory models. Utilizing this hybrid parallelism in high-resolution benchmark simulations with full prescriptions for baryonic physics, we achieved a performance increase of a factor of 2 in the total run-time, while using 75% less memory and 30% less storage compared to the original code, when using the same number of processors. These improvements allow us to perform larger or higher-resolution simulations than what was feasible previously.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>Mining double-line spectroscopic candidates in the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey using human-AI hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize a hybrid approach that integrates the traditional cross-correlation function (CCF) and machine learning to detect spectroscopic multi-systems, specifically focusing on double-line spectroscopic binary (SB2). Based on the ninth data release (DR9) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), which includes a medium-resolution survey (MRS) containing 29,920,588 spectra, we identify 27,164 double-line and 3124 triple-line spectra, corresponding to 7096 SB2 candidates and 1903 triple-line spectroscopic binary (SB3) candidates, respectively, representing about 1% of the selection dataset from LAMOST-MRS DR9. Notably, 70.1% of the SB2 candidates and 89.6% of the SB3 candidates are newly identified. Compared to using only the traditional CCF technique, our method significantly improves the efficiency of detecting SB2, saves time on visual inspections by a factor of four.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Variety of Velocity Dispersion Profiles of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observed and simulated galaxies exhibit a significant variation in their velocity dispersion profiles. We examine the inner and outer slopes of stellar velocity dispersion profiles using integral field spectroscopy data from two surveys, SAMI (for $z &lt; 0.115$) and CALIFA (for $z &lt; 0.03$), comparing them with results from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations: Horizon-AGN (for $z = 0.017$) and NewHorizon (for $z\lesssim1$). The simulated galaxies closely reproduce the variety of velocity dispersion slopes and stellar mass dependence of both inner and outer radii ($0.5\,r_{50}$ and $3\,r_{50}$) as observed, where $r_{50}$ stands for half-light radius. The inner slopes are mainly influenced by the relative radial distribution of the young and old stars formed in-situ: a younger center shows a flatter inner profile. The presence of accreted (ex-situ) stars has two effects on the velocity dispersion profiles. First, because they are more dispersed in spatial and velocity distributions compared to in-situ formed stars, it increases the outer slope of the velocity dispersion profile. It also causes the velocity anisotropy to be more radial. More massive galaxies have a higher fraction of stars formed ex-situ and hence show a higher slope in outer velocity dispersion profile and a higher degree of radial anisotropy. The diversity in the outer velocity dispersion profiles reflects the diverse assembly histories among galaxies.</description>

      <title>GOALS-JWST: The Warm Molecular Outflows of the Merging Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1$\;\rm{kpc}$ apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of $&lt;$100$\;\rm{pc}$, where we focus on the warm molecular H$_2$ gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H$_2$ gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H$_2$ gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of $\sim$1,000$\;\rm{km}\;\rm{s}^{-1}$, which extend out to a distance of 0.7$\;\rm{kpc}$. Based on H$_2$ S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H$_2$ heating. The gas mass of the warm H$_2$ outflow component is estimated to be $M\rm{_{warm,out}}=(1.4\pm0.2)\times10^6\;\rm{M}_{\odot}$, as much as 6$\%$ of the cold H$_2$ mass estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about $7\times10^5\;\rm{yr}$, resulting in a mass outflow rate $\dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}=2.0\pm0.8\;\rm{M}_{\odot}\;\rm{yr}^{-1}$ and kinetic power $P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;\sim\;4\times10^{41}\;\rm{erg}\;\rm{s}^{-1}$. Lastly, regions within our 3.0"x3.0" NIRSpec data where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Ly$\alpha$-emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass is essential. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe on the scale of 10 - 100 cMpc at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at $z$ = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify and characterize protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, with a similar number and angular size of structures identified above a specified density threshold. We are able to recover the simulated protoclusters with $\log$(M$_{z=0}$/$M_\odot$) $\gtrsim$ 14.4 in $\sim$ 60% of the cases. With these objects we show that the descendant masses of the protoclusters in our sample can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median $z$ = 0 mass of $\sim10^{14.5}$M$_\odot$. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a $\sim$0.4 dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations imply that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec insights into the circumnuclear region of Arp 220: A detailed kinematic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is crucial for understanding the regulation of star formation and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Arp 220, the closest ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), is in an advanced phase of a major merger with two distinct nuclei, and it shows evidence of multiphase and multiscale (from &lt; 0.1 to &gt; 5 kpc) outflows. Therefore, it represents an ideal system for investigating outflow mechanisms and feedback phenomena in detail. Using new JWST NIRSpec IFU observations, we investigated the spatially resolved gaseous (in both ionized and hot molecular phases) and stellar kinematics in the innermost 1 kpc. We decoupled the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting, identifying two multiphase outflows, each associated with one nucleus, with velocities up to $\sim 1000$km/s. We also resolved two counter-rotating discs around each nucleus embedded in a larger-scale rotational disk. We compute the total outflow mass ($\approx 10^7$M$_\odot$), the mass rate ($\sim 15$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), and the energetics ($\dot E_{out}\approx 10^{42}$erg/s) for each nucleus, and we found that the ionized and hot molecular outflowing gas contribute around 2-30% of the total mass and the energy of the outflows, as inferred from the combination of multiwavelength information. We discuss the possible origin of the outflows, finding no compelling evidence to prefer a starburst- or AGN-driven scenario. Regardless of their nature, outflows in Arp~220 propagate in multiple directions from parsec to kiloparsec scales, potentially impacting a significant portion of the host galaxy. This contrasts with isolated systems where outflows typically follow a more collimated path or are limited to the central region of the galaxy and hence do not affect the interstellar medium throughout the entire galaxy.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Modelling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-Mass YSOs: I: Constraining the Role of Iron Inclusions and Inelastic Relaxation on Grain Alignment with ALMA Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iron inclusions embedded inside dust grains play a crucial role in both internal alignment (IA) via Barnett relaxation and external alignment via the MAgnetically Enhanced RAdiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism. Moreover, inelastic relaxation is predicted to dominate over Barnett relaxation in driving the IA of micron-sized and very large grains above $10\mu m$ (VLGs). Yet, a detailed modeling of polarized thermal dust emission from Class 0/I Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) taking into account these effects and their observational constraints is still lacking. In this paper, we update the POLARIS code and use it to perform synthetic dust polarization modeling for MHD simulations of an intermediate-mass YSO. Results will be post-processed with CASA to confront ALMA polarimetric observations. We found that to reproduce the high polarization degree of $p \sim 5-30\%$ observed in protostellar envelopes by ALMA, micron-sized and VLGs must contain iron inclusions with $N_{\rm cl} \sim 5 - 10^{3}$ iron atoms per cluster, assuming $30\%$ of iron abundance locked inside dust grains under the cluster form. Inside the inner $\sim 500$ au region, inelastic relaxation must participate in driving the grain internal alignment, and grains must contain larger iron inclusions of $N_{\rm cl} \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ and grow beyond $\geq 10\mu m$ to reproduce $\sim 3-10\%$ of dust polarization observed by ALMA. But given such a combination, the internal alignment and MRAT efficiency acting on VLGs still decrease toward the center, inducing the decrease of $p(\%)$ with increasing gas density, reaching $p \sim 1\%$ inside the disk.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests, including preserving the asymptotic diffusion limit. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey: Spatial extent of [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies at $z=4-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial extent and structure of the [CII] line emission in a sample of 34 galaxies at $z=4-6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey. By modeling the [CII] line emission in the interferometric visibility, we derive the effective radius of [CII] line emission assuming an exponential profile. The [CII] line radius ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 kpc with an average value of $\langle R_{e,[CII]}\rangle=1.90$ kpc. We compare the [CII] sizes with the sizes of rest-frame UV and FIR continua, which were measured from the HST F160W images and ALMA Band-7 continuum images, respectively. We confirm that the [CII] line emission is more spatially extended than the continuum emission, with average size ratios of $\langle R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}\rangle=2.90$ and $\langle R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,FIR}\rangle=1.54$, although about half of the FIR-detected sample show comparable spatial extent between [CII] line and FIR continuum emission. The residual visibility of the best-fit model do not show statistical evidence of flux excess, indicating that the [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies can be characterized by an extended exponential profile. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial extent of [CII] line emission can primarily be explained by PDRs associated with star formation activity, while the contribution from diffuse neutral medium (atomic gas) and the effects of past merger events may further expand the [CII] line distributions, causing their variations. Finally, we report the negative correlation between $\Sigma_{[CII]}$ and EW$_{Ly\alpha}$, and possible negative correlation between $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}$ and EW$_{Ly\alpha}$, which may be in line with the scenario that atomic gas largely contributes to the extended [CII] line emission. Future 3-D analysis of Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ lines will shed light on the association of the extended [CII] line emission with atomic gas and outflows.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nature of Little Red Dots: Constraints on AGN and Stellar Contributions from PRIMER MIRI Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at $z&gt;4$ known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from $1-18\ \mu$m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.</description>

      <title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: a Unified Framework</title>

Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>

Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>
