      <title>Structure preserving discretization: A Berezin-Toeplitz Quantization viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive axiomatization of structure-preserving discretization through the framework of commutative diagrams. By establishing a formal language that captures the essential properties of discretization processes, we provide a rigorous foundation for analyzing how various structures (such as algebraic, geometric, and topological features) are maintained during the transition from continuous to discrete settings. Specifically, we establish that the transition from continuous to discrete differential settings invariably leads to noncommutative structures, reinforcing previous observation on the interplay between discretization and noncommutativity. We demonstrate the applicability of our axiomatization by applying it to the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization, showing that this quantization method adheres to our proposed criteria for structure-preserving discretization. We establish in this setting a precise limit theorem for the approximation of the Laplacian by a sequence of matrix approximations. This work not only enriches the theoretical understanding of the nature of discretization but also sets the stage for further exploration of its applications across various discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Flexural Behavior and Design of Prestressed Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) Beams: Failure Mode and Ductility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is well-known for its ultra-high compressive strength and sustained post-cracking tensile ductility, making it an attractive choice for the construction of modern structures. Prestressed UHPC members, however, often fail quickly after crack localization accompanied by reinforcement rupture, which shows limited failure warnings (i.e., relatively small ductility, nearly invisible cracking, and negligible compressive damage). On the other hand, UHPC members can also be designed to allow the gradual strain hardening of reinforcement to compensate for the load loss due to crack localization, and the final failure is attributed to gradual crushing of UHPC prior to reinforcement rupture. Failure after gradual strain hardening is desirable since it brings warning signs through high ductility, visible cracks, and controlled spalling. To achieve a resilient structural design of UHPC members, this study aims to develop design methods to avoid early failure after crack localization and promote failure after gradual strain hardening. This study first establishes a three-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) model to simulate the flexural behavior of prestressed UHPC beams, which is validated against seven existing experimental beams. Then, parametric analyses are conducted to assess the influence of five key aspects, including the steel rebar-to-prestressing strand ratio, the post-yield hardening of mild steel rebars, the pretensioned stress of prestressing strands, the tensile behavior of UHPC, and the web width to bottom flange ratio. Additionally, the authors propose a design method to predict the failure mode of prestressed UHPC beams, which can be used to guide the design of reinforcement configuration and to promote ductile structural behavior.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for simulating forward-backward stochastic differential equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce forward-backward stochastic differential equations, highlighting the connection between solutions of these and solutions of partial differential equations, related by the Feynman-Kac theorem. We review the technique of approximating solutions to high dimensional partial differential equations using neural networks, and similarly approximate solutions of stochastic differential equations using multilevel Monte Carlo. Connecting the multilevel Monte Carlo method with the neural network framework using the setup established by E et al. and Raissi, we replicate many of their empirical results, and provide novel numerical analyses to produce strong error bounds for the specific framework of Raissi. Our results bound the overall strong error in terms of the maximum of the discretisation error and the neural network's approximation error. Our analyses are pivotal for applications of multilevel Monte Carlo, for which we propose suitable frameworks to exploit the variance structures of the multilevel estimators we elucidate. Also, focusing on the loss function advocated by Raissi, we expose the limitations of this, highlighting and quantifying its bias and variance. Lastly, we propose various avenues of further research which we anticipate should offer significant insight and speed improvements.</description>

      <title>Physics-based stabilized finite element approximations of the Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze two stabilized finite element methods for solving numerically the Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations. The stabilization we consider is carried out by using a shock detector and a discrete graph Laplacian operator for the ion equations, whereas the discrete equation for the electric potential need not be stabilized. Discrete solutions stemmed from the first algorithm preserve both maximum and minimum discrete principles. For the second algorithm, its discrete solutions are conceived so that they hold discrete principles and obey an entropy law provided that an acuteness condition is imposed for meshes. Remarkably the latter is found to be unconditionally stable. We validate our methodology through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Automatic optimal-rate convergence of randomized nets using median-of-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample median of independently generated quasi-Monte Carlo estimators based on randomized digital nets and prove it approximates the target integral value at almost the optimal convergence rate for various function spaces. Contrast to previous methods, the algorithm does not require a prior knowledge of underlying function spaces or even an input of pre-designed $(t,m,s)$-digital nets, and is therefore easier to implement. This study provides further evidence that quasi-Monte Carlo estimators are heavy-tailed when applied to smooth integrands and taking the median can significantly improve the error by filtering out the outliers.</description>

      <title>A conditional normalizing flow for domain decomposed uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a conditional KRnet (cKRnet) based domain decomposed uncertainty quantification (CKR-DDUQ) approach to propagate uncertainties across different physical domains in models governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs. This approach is based on the domain decomposed uncertainty quantification (DDUQ) method presented in [Q. Liao and K. Willcox, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 37 (2015), pp. A103--A133], which suffers a bottleneck of density estimation for local joint input distributions in practice. In this work, we reformulate the required joint distributions as conditional distributions, and propose a new conditional normalizing flow model, called cKRnet, to efficiently estimate the conditional probability density functions. We present the general framework of CKR-DDUQ, conduct its convergence analysis, validate its accuracy and demonstrate its efficiency with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable conservative flux form neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network (CFN) that integrates classical numerical conservation laws into a data-driven framework using the entropy-stable, second-order, and non-oscillatory Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) scheme. The proposed entropy-stable CFN uses slope limiting as a denoising mechanism, ensuring accurate predictions in both noisy and sparse observation environments, as well as in both smooth and discontinuous regions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the entropy-stable CFN achieves both stability and conservation while maintaining accuracy over extended time domains. Furthermore, it successfully predicts shock propagation speeds in long-term simulations, {\it without} oracle knowledge of later-time profiles in the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematics-informed approach to neural operator design, building upon the theoretical framework established in our prior work. By integrating rigorous mathematical analysis with practical design strategies, we aim to enhance the stability, convergence, generalization, and computational efficiency of neural operators. We revisit key theoretical insights, including stability in high dimensions, exponential convergence, and universality of neural operators. Based on these insights, we provide detailed design recommendations, each supported by mathematical proofs and citations. Our contributions offer a systematic methodology for developing next-gen neural operators with improved performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Collocation method for a functional equation arising in behavioral sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal functional equation that is a generalization of the mathematical model used in behavioral sciences. The equation is built upon an operator that introduces a convex combination and a nonlinear mixing of the function arguments. We show that, provided some growth conditions of the coefficients, there exists a unique solution in the natural Lipschitz space. Furthermore, we prove that the regularity of the solution is inherited from the smoothness properties of the coefficients.
  As a natural numerical method to solve the general case, we consider the collocation scheme of piecewise linear functions. We prove that the method converges with the error bounded by the error of projecting the Lipschitz function onto the piecewise linear polynomial space. Moreover, provided sufficient regularity of the coefficients, the scheme is of the second order measured in the supremum norm.
  A series of numerical experiments verify the proved claims and show that the implementation is computationally cheap and exceeds the frequently used Picard iteration by orders of magnitude in the calculation time.</description>

      <title>High order numerical methods for solving high orders functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct high order numerical methods for solving third and fourth orders nonlinear functional differential equations (FDE). They are based on the discretization of iterative methods on continuous level with the use of the trapezoidal quadrature formulas with corrections. Depending on the number of terms in the corrections we obtain methods of $O(h^4)$ and $O(h^6)$ accuracy. Some numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of the obtained theoretical results. The approach used here for the third and fourth orders nonlinear functional differential equations can be applied to functional differential equations of any orders.</description>

      <title>Randomized coupled decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled decompositions are a widely used tool for data fusion. This paper studies the coupled matrix factorization (CMF) where two matrices $X$ and $Y$ are represented in a low-rank format sharing one common factor, as well as the coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) where a matrix $Y$ and a tensor $\mathcal{X}$ are represented in a low-rank format sharing a factor matrix. We show that these problems are equivalent to the low-rank approximation of the matrix $[X \ Y]$ for CMF, that is $[X_{(1)} \ Y]$ for CMTF. Then, in order to speed up computation process, we adapt several randomization techniques, namely, randomized SVD, randomized subspace iteration, and randomized block Krylov iteration to the algorithms for coupled decompositions. We present extensive results of the numerical tests. Furthermore, as a novel approach and with a high success rate, we apply our randomized algorithms to the face recognition problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive neural network basis methods for partial differential equations with low-regular solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to devise an adaptive neural network basis method for numerically solving a second-order semilinear partial differential equation (PDE) with low-regular solutions in two/three dimensions. The method is obtained by combining basis functions from a class of shallow neural networks and the resulting multi-scale analogues, a residual strategy in adaptive methods and the non-overlapping domain decomposition method. At the beginning, in view of the solution residual, we partition the total domain $\Omega$ into $K+1$ non-overlapping subdomains, denoted respectively as $\{\Omega_k\}_{k=0}^K$, where the exact solution is smooth on subdomain $\Omega_{0}$ and low-regular on subdomain $\Omega_{k}$ ($1\le k\le K$). Secondly, the low-regular solutions on different subdomains \(\Omega_{k}\)~($1\le k\le K$) are approximated by neural networks with different scales, while the smooth solution on subdomain \(\Omega_0\) is approximated by the initialized neural network. Thirdly, we determine the undetermined coefficients by solving the linear least squares problems directly or the nonlinear least squares problem via the Gauss-Newton method. The proposed method can be extended to multi-level case naturally. Finally, we use this adaptive method for several peak problems in two/three dimensions to show its high-efficient computational performance.</description>

      <title>Fully consistent lowest-order finite element methods for generalised Stokes flows with variable viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable viscosity arises in many flow scenarios, often imposing numerical challenges. Yet, discretisation methods designed specifically for non-constant viscosity are few, and their analysis is even scarcer. In finite element methods for incompressible flows, the most popular approach to allow equal-order velocity-pressure interpolation are residual-based stabilisations. For low-order elements, however, the viscous part of that residual cannot be approximated, often compromising accuracy. Assuming slightly more regularity on the viscosity field, we can construct stabilisation methods that fully approximate the residual, regardless of the polynomial order of the finite element spaces. This work analyses two variants of this fully consistent approach, with the generalised Stokes system as a model problem. We prove unique solvability and derive expressions for the stabilisation parameter, generalising some classical results for constant viscosity. Numerical results illustrate how our method completely eliminates the spurious pressure boundary layers typically induced by low-order PSPG-like stabilisations.</description>

      <title>On a Non-Uniform $\alpha$-Robust IMEX-L1 Mixed FEM for Time-Fractional PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-uniform implicit-explicit L1 mixed finite element method (IMEX-L1-MFEM) is investigated for a class of time-fractional partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) with space-time dependent coefficients and non-self-adjoint elliptic part. The proposed fully discrete method combines an IMEX-L1 method on a graded mesh in the temporal variable with a mixed finite element method in spatial variables. The focus of the study is to analyze stability results and to establish optimal error estimates, up to a logarithmic factor, for both the solution and the flux in $L^2$-norm when the initial data $u_0\in H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$. Additionally, an error estimate in $L^\infty$-norm is derived for 2D problems. All the derived estimates and bounds in this article remain valid as $\alpha\to 1^{-}$, where $\alpha$ is the order of the Caputo fractional derivative. Finally, the results of several numerical experiments conducted at the end of this paper are confirming our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Discrete the solving model of time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations using Euler-forward formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations are presented as early time-variant versions of the complex conjugate matrix equations. Current solving methods include Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models, both of which use ode45 for continuous model. Given practical computational considerations, discrete these models is also important. Based on Euler-forward formula discretion, Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model are proposed. Numerical experiments using step sizes of 0.1 and 0.001. The above experiments show that Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model exhibit different neural dynamics compared to their continuous counterparts, such as trajectory correction in Con-DZND2-2i model and the swallowing phenomenon in Con-DZND1-2i model, with convergence affected by step size. These experiments highlight the differences between optimizing sampling discretion errors and space compressive approximation errors in neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error Estimate for a Semi-Lagrangian Scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the numerical approximation of time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations on networks, providing a convergence error estimate for the semi-Lagrangian scheme introduced in (Carlini and Siconolfi, 2023), where convergence was proven without an error estimate. We derive a convergence error estimate of order one-half. This is achieved showing the equivalence between two definitions of solutions to this problem proposed in (Imbert and Monneau, 2017) and (Siconolfi, 2022), a result of independent interest, and applying a general convergence result from (Carlini, Festa and Forcadel, 2020).</description>

      <title>Differentiable Quantum Computing for Large-scale Linear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As industrial models and designs grow increasingly complex, the demand for optimal control of large-scale dynamical systems has significantly increased. However, traditional methods for optimal control incur significant overhead as problem dimensions grow. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end quantum algorithm for linear-quadratic control with provable speedups. Our algorithm, based on a policy gradient method, incorporates a novel quantum subroutine for solving the matrix Lyapunov equation. Specifically, we build a quantum-assisted differentiable simulator for efficient gradient estimation that is more accurate and robust than classical methods relying on stochastic approximation. Compared to the classical approaches, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end quantum application to linear control problems with provable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>On the existence of extremal solutions for the conjugate discrete-time Riccati equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of conjugate discrete-time Riccati equations (CDARE), arising originally from the linear quadratic regulation problem for discrete-time antilinear systems. Recently, we have proved the existence of the maximal solution to the CDARE with a nonsingular control weighting matrix under the framework of the constructive method. Our contribution in the work is to finding another meaningful Hermitian solutions, which has received little attention in this topic. Moreover, we show that some extremal solutions cannot be attained at the same time, and almost (anti-)stabilizing solutions coincide with some extremal solutions. It is to be expected that our theoretical results presented in this paper will play an important role in the optimal control problems for discrete-time antilinear systems.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, Edelman and Dumitriu provide a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits introduced and analyzed by Edelman and Sutton, and subsequently analyzed in work by Ramirez, Rider, and Vir\'ag. In this work we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 3D numerical modeling of granular cargo movement on bulk carriers in waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel monolithic approach for simulating vessels in waves with granular cargo is presented using a Finite Volume framework. This model integrates a three-phase Volume of Fluid method to represent air, water, and cargo, coupled with a granular material model. The approach incorporates vessel dynamics by assuming rigid-body motion for the vessel's empty hull. A three degrees of freedom rigid-body motion solver is applied for a 3D case study. The model also includes inviscid far-field boundary conditions facilitating the generation of linear waves approaching the vessel and applies a rigid-perfectly plastic material model for the granular phase. The model's efficacy is demonstrated through a validation of the three-phase Volume of the Fluid method, a verification of the granular material model, and finally, a reconstruction of the "Jian Fu Star" incident in a fully 3D simulation. This integrated approach is a feasibility study for investigating bulk carrier accidents, offering a powerful tool for maritime safety analysis and design optimization.</description>

      <title>LES-SINDy: Laplace-Enhanced Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) is a powerful tool for the data-driven discovery of governing equations. However, it encounters challenges when modeling complex dynamical systems involving high-order derivatives or discontinuities, particularly in the presence of noise. These limitations restrict its applicability across various fields in applied mathematics and physics. To mitigate these, we propose Laplace-Enhanced SparSe Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (LES-SINDy). By transforming time-series measurements from the time domain to the Laplace domain using the Laplace transform and integration by parts, LES-SINDy enables more accurate approximations of derivatives and discontinuous terms. It also effectively handles unbounded growth functions and accumulated numerical errors in the Laplace domain, thereby overcoming challenges in the identification process. The model evaluation process selects the most accurate and parsimonious dynamical systems from multiple candidates. Experimental results across diverse ordinary and partial differential equations show that LES-SINDy achieves superior robustness, accuracy, and parsimony compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Utilization Trade-off in Wireless Networks with Explainable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective distribution of user transmit powers is essential for the significant advancements that the emergence of 6G wireless networks brings. In recent studies, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been employed to address this challenge. However, these methods frequently encounter issues regarding fairness and computational inefficiency when making decisions, rendering them unsuitable for future dynamic services that depend heavily on the participation of each individual user. To address this gap, this paper focuses on the challenge of transmit power allocation in wireless networks, aiming to optimize $\alpha$-fairness to balance network utilization and user equity. We introduce a novel approach utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of machine learning models that offer low inference costs compared to traditional DNNs through superior explainability. The study provides a comprehensive problem formulation, establishing the NP-hardness of the power allocation problem. Then, two algorithms are proposed for dataset generation and decentralized KAN training, offering a flexible framework for achieving various fairness objectives in dynamic 6G environments. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of fairness and inference cost. The results underscore the potential of KANs to overcome the limitations of existing DNN-based methods, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid adaptation and fairness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by numerical modeling of ultrasound waves, we investigate robust conforming finite element discretizations of quasilinear and possibly nonlocal equations of Westervelt type. These wave equations involve either a strong dissipation or damping of fractional-derivative type and we unify them into one class by introducing a memory kernel that satisfies non-restrictive regularity and positivity assumptions. As the involved damping parameter is relatively small and can become negligible in certain (inviscid) media, it is important to develop methods that remain stable as the said parameter vanishes. To this end, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we determine sufficient conditions under which conforming finite element discretizations of (non)local Westervelt equations can be made robust with respect to the dissipation parameter. Secondly, we establish the rate of convergence of the semi-discrete solutions in the singular vanishing dissipation limit. The analysis hinges upon devising appropriate energy functionals for the semi-discrete solutions that remain uniformly bounded with respect to the damping parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an iterative method to solve problems in small-strain non-linear elasticity. The method is inspired by recent work in data-driven computational mechanics, which reformulated the classic boundary value problem of continuum mechanics using the concept of "phase space". The latter is an abstract metric space, whose coordinates are indexed by strains and stress components, where each possible state of the discretized body corresponds to a point. Since the phase space is associated to the discretized body, it is finite dimensional. Two subsets are then defined: an affine space termed "physically-admissible set" made up by those points that satisfy equilibrium and a "materially-admissible set" containing points that satisfy the constitutive law. Solving the boundary-value problem amounts to finding the intersection between these two subdomains. In the linear-elastic setting, this can be achieved through the solution of a set of linear equations; when material non-linearity enters the picture, such is not the case anymore and iterative solution approaches are necessary. Our iterative method consists on projecting points alternatively from one set to the other, until convergence. The method is similar in spirit to the ``method of alternative projections'' and to the ``method of projections onto convex sets'', for which there is a solid mathematical foundation that furnishes conditions for existence of solutions and convergence, upon which we rely to assess the method's performance. We present a proof of geometric convergence rate and two examples: a fundamental one to illustrate the features of the method, and a realistic one to showcase its capacities and strengths when compared to the classic Newton-Raphson method, the usual tool of choice in non-linear continuum mechanics. Finally, its ability to deal with constitutive laws based on neural network is also showcased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the Method of Regularized Stokeslets (MRS) in three dimensions is developed for triangulated surfaces with a piecewise linear force distribution. The method extends the regularized Stokeslet segment methodology used for piecewise linear curves. By using analytic integration of the regularized Stokeslet kernel over the triangles, the regularization parameter $\epsilon$ is effectively decoupled from the spatial discretization of the surface. This is in contrast to the usual implementation of the method in which the regularization parameter is chosen for accuracy reasons to be about the same size as the spatial discretization. The validity of the method is demonstrated through several examples, including the flow around a rigidly translating/rotating sphere, a rotating spheroid, and the squirmer model for self-propulsion. Notably, second order convergence in the spatial discretization for fixed $\epsilon$ is demonstrated. Considerations of mesh design and choice of regularization parameter are discussed, and the performance of the method is compared with existing quadrature-based implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation performance can be significantly impacted by biased noise in observations, altering the signal magnitude and introducing fast oscillations or discontinuities when the system lacks smoothness. To mitigate these issues, this paper employ variational state estimation using the so-called parametrized-background data-weak method. This approach relies on a background manifold parametrized by a set of constraints, enabling the state estimation by solving a minimization problem on a reduced-order background model, subject to constraints imposed by the input measurements. The proposed formulation incorporates a novel bias correction mechanism and a manifold decomposition that handles rapid oscillations by treating them as slow-decaying modes based on a two-scale splitting of the classical reconstruction algorithm. The method is validated in different examples, including the assimilation of biased synthetic data, discontinuous signals, and Doppler ultrasound data obtained from experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation for the POD formulation of the parametric laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A posteriori reduced-order models (ROM), e.g. based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), are essential to affordably tackle realistic parametric problems. They rely on a trustful training set, that is a family of full-order solutions (snapshots) representative of all possible outcomes of the parametric problem. Having such a rich collection of snapshots is not, in many cases, computationally viable. A strategy for data augmentation, designed for parametric laminar incompressible flows, is proposed to enrich poorly populated training sets. The goal is to include in the new, artificial snapshots emerging features, not present in the original basis, that do enhance the quality of the reduced basis (RB) constructed using POD dimensionality reduction. The methodologies devised are based on exploiting basic physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation, to construct physically-relevant, artificial snapshots at a fraction of the cost of additional full-order solutions. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the ideas exploiting only mass conservation (i.e., incompressibility) are not producing significant added value with respect to the standard linear combinations of snapshots. Conversely, accounting for the linearized momentum balance via the Oseen equation does improve the quality of the resulting approximation and therefore is an effective data augmentation strategy in the framework of viscous incompressible laminar flows. Numerical experiments of parametric flow problems, in two and three dimensions, at low and moderate values of the Reynolds number are presented to showcase the superior performance of the data-enriched POD-RB with respect to the standard ROM in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Interpolation by Polynomials with Non-negative Real Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider interpolation by \textit{completely monotonous} polynomials (CMPs for short), that is, polynomials with non-negative real coefficients. In particular, given a finite set $S\subset \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} \times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, we consider \textit{the minimal polynomial} of $S$, introduced by Berg [1985], which is `minimal,' in the sense that it is eventually majorized by all the other CMPs interpolating $S$. We give an upper bound of the degree of the minimal polynomial of $S$ when it exists. Furthermore, we give another algorithm for computing the minimal polynomial of given $S$ which utilizes an order structure on sign sequences. Applying the upper bound above, we also analyze the computational complexity of algorithms for computing minimal polynomials including ours.</description>

      <title>Collocation methods for nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new methods for integrating nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds. These methods rely on interpolatory projections onto the tangent space, enabling low-rank time integration of vector fields that can be evaluated entry-wise. A key advantage of our approach is that it does not require the vector field to exhibit low-rank structure, thereby overcoming significant limitations of traditional dynamical low-rank methods based on orthogonal projection. To construct the interpolatory projectors, we develop a sparse tensor sampling algorithm based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) that parameterizes tensor train manifolds and their tangent spaces with cross interpolation. Using these projectors, we propose two time integration schemes on low-rank tensor train manifolds. The first scheme integrates the solution at selected interpolation indices and constructs the solution with cross interpolation. The second scheme generalizes the well-known orthogonal projector-splitting integrator to interpolatory projectors. We demonstrate the proposed methods with applications to several tensor differential equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Markov chain quasi-Monte Carlo for Gibbs samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical analysis, Monte Carlo (MC) stands as a classical numerical integration method. When encountering challenging sample problem, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a commonly employed method. However, the MCMC estimator is biased after a fixed number of iterations. Unbiased MCMC, an advancement achieved through coupling techniques, addresses this bias issue in MCMC. It allows us to run many short chains in parallel. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), known for its high order of convergence, is an alternative of MC. By incorporating the idea of QMC into MCMC, Markov chain quasi-Monte Carlo (MCQMC) effectively reduces the variance of MCMC, especially in Gibbs samplers. This work presents a novel approach that integrates unbiased MCMC with MCQMC, called as an unbiased MCQMC method. This method renders unbiased estimators while improving the rate of convergence significantly. Numerical experiments demonstrate that for Gibbs sampling, unbiased MCQMC with a sample size of $N$ yields a faster root mean square error (RMSE) rate than the \(O(N^{-1/2})\) rate of unbiased MCMC, toward an RMSE rate of \(O(N^{-1})\) for low-dimensional problems. Surprisingly, in a challenging problem of 1049-dimensional P\'olya Gamma Gibbs sampler, the RMSE can still be reduced by several times for moderate sample sizes. In the setting of parallelization, unbiased MCQMC also performs better than unbiased MCMC, even running with short chains.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware deep learning framework for the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is the first physics-aware machine learning technique that can have interpretability property for the obstacle detection. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically investigated. We also prove that adding small noise to the input limited aperture data can introduce additional regularization terms and effectively improve the smoothness of the learned inverse operator. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.</description>

      <title>A Simple Collocation-Type Approach to Numerical Stochastic Homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel collocation-type numerical stochastic homogenization method for prototypical stochastic homogenization problems with random coefficient fields of small correlation lengths. The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Numerical Methods for Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common way to numerically solve Fokker-Planck equations is the Chang-Cooper method in space combined with one of the Euler methods in time. However, the explicit Euler method is only conditionally positive, leading to severe restrictions on the time step to ensure positivity. On the other hand, the implicit Euler method is robust but nonlinearly implicit. Instead, we propose to combine the Chang-Cooper method with unconditionally positive Patankar-type time integration methods, since they are unconditionally positive, robust for stiff problems, only linearly implicit, and also higher-order accurate. We describe the combined approach, analyse it, and present a relevant numerical example demonstrating advantages compared to schemes proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Active flux methods for hyperbolic conservation laws -- flux vector splitting and bound-preservation: One-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces independently. Within the method of lines framework, the point value can be updated based on Jacobian splitting (JS), incorporating the upwind idea. However, such JS-based AF methods encounter transonic issues for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate upwind direction estimation. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to the transonic issue. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average in high-order AF methods is rewritten as a convex combination of using the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. Several challenging benchmark tests are conducted to verify the accuracy, BP properties, and shock-capturing ability of the methods.</description>

      <title>Active flux methods for hyperbolic conservation laws -- flux vector splitting and bound-preservation: Two-dimensional case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the active flux (AF) methods for two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws, focusing on the flux vector splitting (FVS) for the point value update and bound-preserving (BP) limitings, which is an extension of our previous work [J.M. Duan, W. Barsukow, C. Klingenberg, arXiv:2405.02447]. The FVS-based point value update is shown to address the mesh alignment issue that appeared in a quasi-2D Riemann problem along one axis direction on Cartesian meshes. Consequently, the AF methods based on the FVS outperform those using Jacobian splitting, which are prone to transonic and mesh alignment issues. A shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can reduce oscillations well. Some benchmark problems are tested to verify the accuracy, BP property, and shock-capturing ability of our BP AF method. Moreover, for the double Mach reflection and forward-facing step problems, the present AF method can capture comparable or better small-scale features compared to the third-order discontinuous Galerkin method with the TVB limiter on the same mesh resolution, while using fewer degrees of freedom, demonstrating the efficiency and potential of our BP AF method for high Mach number flows.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. For nonlocal hydrodynamics, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. Using a temporal integrator developed in previous work, we demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively. In the latter case, we show that the effect of hydrodynamics can be accounted for through steric repulsion.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Systems of Non-interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our focus is on simulating the dynamics of non-interacting particles, which, under certain assumptions, can be formally described by the Dean-Kawasaki equation. The Dean-Kawasaki equation can be solved numerically using standard finite volume methods. However, the numerical approximation implicitly requires a sufficiently large number of particles to ensure the positivity of the solution and accurate approximation of the stochastic flux. To address this challenge, we extend hybrid algorithms for particle systems to scenarios where the density is low. The aim is to create a hybrid algorithm that switches from a finite volume discretization to a particle-based method when the particle density falls below a certain threshold. We develop criteria for determining this threshold by comparing higher-order statistics obtained from the finite volume method with particle simulations. We then demonstrate the use of the resulting criteria for dynamic adaptation in both two- and three-dimensional spatial settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering via Orthogonalization-Free Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While orthogonalization exists in current dimensionality reduction methods in spectral clustering on undirected graphs, it does not scale in parallel computing environments. We propose four orthogonalization-free methods for spectral clustering. Our methods optimize one of two objective functions with no spurious local minima. In theory, two methods converge to features isomorphic to the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of the symmetric normalized Laplacian. The other two converge to features isomorphic to weighted eigenvectors weighting by the square roots of eigenvalues. We provide numerical evidence on the synthetic graphs from the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge to demonstrate the effectiveness of the orthogonalization-free methods. Numerical results on the streaming graphs show that the orthogonalization-free methods are competitive in the streaming graph scenario since they can take full advantage of the computed features of previous graphs and converge fast. Our methods are also more scalable in parallel computing environments because orthogonalization is unnecessary. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the scalability of our methods. Consequently, our methods have advantages over other dimensionality reduction methods when handling spectral clustering for large streaming graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit uniform two-sided bounds for the phase functions of Bessel functions and of their derivatives. As a consequence, we obtain new enclosures for the zeros of Bessel functions and their derivatives in terms of inverse values of some elementary functions. These bounds are valid, with a few exceptions, for all zeros and all Bessel functions with non-negative indices. We provide numerical evidence showing that our bounds either improve or closely match the best previously known ones.</description>
