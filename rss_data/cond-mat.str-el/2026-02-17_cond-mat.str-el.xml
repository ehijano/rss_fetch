      <title>Adaptive Pseudoboson Density-Matrix Renormalization Group for Dilute 2D Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated systems in two dimensions is notoriously challenging due to rapid entanglement growth and frustration. Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moir\'e materials and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Exact dimer ground state and quantum phase transitions in a coupled spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin ladders are key models that act as intermediaries between one-dimensional and two-dimensional spin systems. In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a N\'eel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to N\'eel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the N\'eel order vanishes for $J_1 &gt; 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Hidden Density-Wave Instability in the Trimer Ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a hidden density-wave instability in the trimer-based ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10, previously regarded as a pure antiferromagnet with a phase transition at TA=100 K. This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Evolution of magnetic correlation in doped Hubbard model with altermagnetic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(\pi,\pi)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(\pi,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Localized-basis formulation of interacting Hamiltonians in flat topological bands: coherent states and coherent-like states for fractional physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological bands, it is impossible to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions while preserving the symmetries. Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $\nu=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity: A multi-method study of non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermiticity Induced Universal Anomalies in Kondo Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong correlation, when combined with dissipation in open systems, can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems. We propose a practical physical setup that realizes a non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model. We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity. Our results identify a novel class of transport phenomena unrecognized before, driven by intertwined effects of correlation and dissipation.</description>

      <title>Exchange interactions and finite-temperature magnetism in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles investigation of magnetic exchange interactions and critical behavior in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices for $n=2,4,6$. For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Disorder-driven stochastic dynamics in Mott resistive-switching systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled disorder in correlated materials provides a new route to emergent stochastic dynamics in neuromorphic hardware. Here we show that focused ion beam irradiation in VO$_{2}$- and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based resistive-switching oscillators induces a transition from regular periodic oscillations to strongly irregular stochastic firing, while simultaneously reducing the required switching energy by orders of magnitude. Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes. These results are validated by experimental measurements on irradiated VO$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices.</description>

      <title>Composite Boson Theory of Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has been deeply guided by band topology and quantum geometry. Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fluctuations driven by quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quantum distance, magnetic susceptibility in the non-interacting limit can be rigorously split into two contributions: one arising solely from band dispersion, while the other stems from quantum geometric contributions. In this Letter, we apply this decomposition to two materials, LaFeAsO and Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O, and demonstrate that their dominant magnetic fluctuations originate from the geometric contribution. In LaFeAsO, stripe-type antiferromagnetic fluctuations arise primarily from quantum geometry, while in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O the geometric term suppresses antiferromagnetic fluctuations and stabilizes ferromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in governing magnetic fluctuations in multi-band systems, and provide a unique and quantitative framework to disentangle band-structure and wavefunction-geometry effects that have often been discussed collectively as multi-orbital effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in the Kitaev material Na$_2$IrO$_3$ studied by neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering experiments with a large set of comounted Na$_2$IrO$_3$ crystals reveal the low-energy magnon dispersion in this candidate material for Kitaev physics. The magnon gap amounts to 1.7(1) meV and can be interpreted similarly to the sister compound $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ to stem from the zone boundaries in the antiferromagnetic zigzag structure. The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative Dynamic Approaches to the Kibble-Zurek Scaling Limit with an Initial Gapless Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium many-body physics is one of the core problems in modern physics, while the dynamical scaling from a gapless phase to the critical point is a most important challenge with very few knowledge so far. In the driven dynamics with a tuning rate $R$ across the quantum critical point (QCP) of a system with size $L$, the finite-time scaling shows that the square of the order parameter $m^2$ obeys a simple scaling relation $m^2\propto R^{2\beta/\nu r}$ in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$. Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$ are {\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\propto R^{2\beta/\nu r}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state.</description>

      <title>The distinction of time-reversal-like degeneracy by electronic transport in a new compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new compound, Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$, and reveal the hidden time-reversal-like degenerate states within it. Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated Josephson junction: proximity effect in the single-layer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $\phi=\pi$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in EuAl4 under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the intermetallid rare-earth tetragonal EuAl4 system, competing itinerant exchange mechanisms lead to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a centrosymmetric skyrmion lattice. Previous inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments revealed that the incommensurate charge-density wave (CDW) transition in EuAl4 (TCDW = 142 K) is driven by momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC). We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Competing states in the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model: a dynamical density-matrix renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.</description>

      <title>Nematostriction in frustrated two-dimensional Heisenberg models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nematic phase transition in the Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$-model on square and triangular lattices, accounting for finite lattice compressibility and bond-length-dependent magnetic exchange. Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Controlled Theory of Skyrmion Chern Bands in Moir\'e Quantum Materials: Quantum Geometry and Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in moir\'e quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moir\'e-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moir\'e-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>3d Conformal Field Theories via Fuzzy Sphere Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Multilayer Graphene with Arbitrary Stackings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking geometry in multilayer graphene (MLG) provides an interesting degree of freedom to engineer its electronic structure near the Fermi level, wherein the linear bands in single layer graphene could retain or evolve into parabolic or flat bands. Using a tight-binding model, we carried out a detailed analytical analysis of the electronic band structures for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. Moreover, we find that an interplay of parallel and rhombohedral stackings allows for flat band engineering and enhancement in arbitrarily stacked MLGs. The existence of flat bands in MLGs might offer another interesting platform for exploring the superconductivity in graphene systems beyond the twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic spin-momentum locking has been proven in time-reversal-breaking classes of materials with zero net magnetization in the non-relativistic limit, such as altermagnets and other non-collinear magnets. Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space.</description>

      <title>Measuring Spin-Charge Separation by an Off-diagonal Dissipative Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractionalization of symmetry - exemplified by spin-charge separation in the 1D Hubbard model and fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect - is a typical strongly correlated phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite the success in measuring velocity differences, however, it is still quite challenging in probing emergent excitations' anomalous dimensions experimentally. We propose a off-diagonal dissipative response protocol, leveraging dissipative response theory (DRT), to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-$\downarrow$ particles and measuring the spin-$\uparrow$ response, we uncover a universal temporal signature: the off-diagonal response exhibits a crossover from cubic-in-time ($t^3$) growth at short times to linear-in-time ($t$) decay at long times. Crucially, the coefficients $\varkappa^s$ (short-time) and $\varkappa^l$ (long-time) encode the distinct anomalous dimensions and velocities of spinons and holons, providing unambiguous evidence of fractionalization. This signal vanishes trivially without spin-charge separation. Our predictions, verified numerically via tDMRG, with microscopic parameters linking with Luttinger parameters by Bethe ansatz, establish off-diagonal dissipative response as a probe of quantum fractionalization in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic perspective on Nielsen--Ninomiya-type no-go theorems arising from group cohomological anomalies, revisiting in particular the version proved by Kapustin and Sopenko. Departing from their analytic proof, our approach emphasizes the algebraic structure of symmetry actions and the local computability of anomaly indices. We demonstrate that this no-go theorem is due to a fundamental algebraic incompatibility between anomaly data and the dimension of local Hilbert spaces. Specifically, when an anomaly index is locally computable via quasi-local unitary operators, a suitable gauge fixing trivializes their (generalized) determinants, imposing unexpected and nontrivial constraints on lattice regularizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of exceptional points, dubbed interaction-enabled $n$-fold exceptional points [EP$n$s ($n=2,3$)] -- EP$n$s protected by topology that are prohibited at the non-interacting level. Specifically, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic systems host such interaction-enabled EP$n$s ($n=2,3$) in parameter space that are protected by charge U(1), pseudo-spin-parity, and $PT$ symmetries. The interaction-enabled EP2s are protected by zero-dimensional topology and give rise to qualitative changes in the loss rate, an experimentally measurable quantity for cold atoms. Furthermore, we reveal that interactions enable EP3s protected by one-dimensional topology beyond the point-gap topological classifications, suggesting the potential presence of a broader class of interaction-enabled non-Hermitian degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</description>

      <title>Ilmenite-Type Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ via Topochemical Ion Exchange: Stacking Faults and Low-Temperature Magnetic Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of an ilmenite-type polymorph of Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ distinct from the known post-perovskite and perovskite phases, via low-temperature topochemical Ca$^{2+}$/2Na$^+$ exchange from Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent. A freezing-like bulk magnetic anomaly is suggested at $T^* \sim 25$ K (defined by the onset of a ZFC/FC bifurcation at $\mu_{0}H = 10$ mT), accompanied by a broad heat capacity feature and Curie-Weiss behavior with a large negative Weiss temperature of $\theta_W \sim -98$ K. The effective moment $\mu_{\rm eff} = 1.68 \mu_{\rm B}$ per Ir is consistent with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ for an Ir$^{4+}$. SEM-EDX suggests an A-site content below unity (Ca/Ir $&lt;$ 1); accordingly, we describe the ion-exchanged product using the nonstoichiometric formula Ca$_x$IrO$_3$. These results identify ilmenite-type CaIrO$_3$ as a honeycomb iridate in which stacking disorder can be quantified (with caveats regarding model and instrument correlations) and related to its low-temperature magnetic behavior.</description>

      <title>Reversible tuning of magnetic order and intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films via stoichiometry control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.</description>

      <title>Homological origin of transversal implementability of logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transversal Pauli Z rotations provide a natural route to fault-tolerant logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes, yet their capability is fundamentally constrained. In this work, we formulate the refinement problem of realizing a logical diagonal gate by a transversal implementation with a finer discrete rotation angle and show that its solvability is completely characterized by the Bockstein homomorphism in homology theory. Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass (Zr-BMG) clamp cell designed for high-pressure inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The INS spectra of the empty cell exhibit broad and featureless backgrounds, reflecting the amorphous structure of the Zr-BMG. Test measurements using a reference sample, CsFeCl$_{3}$, confirm that the neutron transmission of the Zr-BMG cell is significantly higher than that of a conventional monobloc CuBe clamp cell. These results demonstrate that the Zr-BMG clamp cell provides both enhanced neutron transparency and a clean background profile, thereby advancing high-pressure INS studies.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial strain tuned magnetism of the altermagnet candidate h-FeS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear magnetic materials with 'alter'nating local crystalline environments, characterized by joint spin and crystalline symmetries that enable ferromagnetic-like transport properties but with vanishing net magnetization. Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-driven interfacial magnetism in Ru-deficient SrRuO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While stoichiometric SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) is a metallic itinerant ferromagnet with relatively homogeneous magnetization, Ru deficiency provides a powerful route to alter its electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties. Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Absence of Long-Range Order and Magnetic Anisotropy in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the rare-earth triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ using single-crystal magnetization (1.8~K $\leq T \leq$ 300~K, $\mu_0 H \leq 7$~T) and specific-heat measurements down to 45~mK. The dc susceptibility confirms a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state with pronounced Ising-type anisotropy, with $g_c \approx 3.7$ and $g_{ab} \approx 1.45$. Curie--Weiss fits yield weak, anisotropic antiferromagnetic exchange, with $\theta_c = -0.54$~K and $\theta_{ab} = -0.87$~K. Heat-capacity measurements show no long-range magnetic order down to 40~mK, corresponding to a frustration index $f \gtrsim 20$. Instead, $C_m/T$ exhibits a broad maximum near 0.081~K whose magnitude and field evolution are consistent with short-range correlations in an anisotropic triangular lattice. Applied magnetic fields open a Zeeman gap where the specific-heat anomaly follows $\Delta = g \mu_B \mu_0 H$, and $M(H,T)$ is well described by a Brillouin function for an effective $J = 1/2$ moment. The field tuning of the low-temperature entropy manifold allows self-cooling from 1.8~K to 53~mK by adiabatic demagnetisation from a 9~T field. These results identify NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a nearly ideal weak-exchange triangular magnet with a field-tunable correlated ground state, where two-dimensional crossover effects may emerge from frustrated XXZ interactions.</description>

Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Semiclassical Spin Dynamics for Ordered Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki Model for Quantum Ferromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a spin-$S$ ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$, which is a ferromagnetic generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$. This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states. In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation. This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field. Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo spin lattice (KSL) systems away from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state have been found to display strange metal behaviour. A signature of strange metals in correlated systems is large Nernst response. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have been demonstrated as 2D KSL systems in STM studies. Here going beyond STM experiments we report a frustrated AFM state on molecular interfaces of Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with around room temperature spin freezing transitions. Near these transitions we measure an anomalous Nernst coefficient of at least 3 $\mu$V/K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl\textsubscript{11}O\textsubscript{19}, revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near \SI{5}{K} shows a complex field dependence that mirrors the multi-hump behavior of the magnetic specific heat, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity $\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)$ scales linearly with $M^2$, consistent with a biquadratic $P^2M^2$ term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constant $\lambda(T)$ that decreases with heating from ($1.07\pm0.01)\times10^{-4}\,\mu_{\mathrm{B}}^{-2}$ (at 5\,K) to $(4.77\pm0.02)\times10^{-5}\,\mu_{\mathrm{B}}^{-2}$ (at 10\,K), reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr$^{3+}$. Consistently, the uniaxial thermal expansion develops an additional low-temperature hump below $\sim\SI{30}{K}$ that is progressively suppressed by magnetic field, recovering an approximately saturated response by \SI{9}{T}. These results identify PrMgAl\textsubscript{11}O\textsubscript{19} as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</description>

      <title>Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>

Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of performing quantum chemistry calculations on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for quantum computers. Yet, closer scrutiny of the proposed algorithms shows that there are considerable difficulties along the way. Here, we propose two criteria for evaluating two leading quantum approaches for finding the ground state of molecules. The first criterion applies to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to the level of imprecision/decoherence that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of the targeted precision, the number of gates and the typical energy contribution from states populated by decoherence processes. We find that decoherence is highly detrimental to the accuracy of VQE and performing relevant chemistry calculations would require performances that are expected for fault-tolerant quantum computers, not mere noisy hardware, even with advanced error mitigation techniques. Physically, the sensitivity of VQE to decoherence originates from the fact that, in VQE, the spectrum of the studied molecule has no correlation with the spectrum of the quantum hardware used to perform the computation.
  The second criterion applies to the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, which is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE requires an input state with a large enough overlap with the sought-after ground state. We provide a criterion to estimate quantitatively this overlap based on the energy and the energy variance of said input state. Using input states from a variety of state-of-the-art classical methods, we show that the scaling of this overlap with system size does display the standard orthogonality catastrophe, namely an exponential suppression with system size. This in turns leads to an exponentially reduced QPE success probability.</description>

      <title>Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We consider its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating a general class of interacting fermion lattice models in Markovian open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the "vacuum" (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative fermionic modes composed of single-fermion operators, which govern the long-time nonequilibrium dynamics. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy matrix of these bare modes in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to derive an exact integral representation. By imposing complex momentum conservation, we obtain a simplified expression for corrections to Liouvillian spectrum that agrees well with numerical calculations to high precision. We further perform perturbative analysis of Liouvillian eigenstates and identify signatures of interaction-enhanced NHSE at the quasiparticle level, manifested as renormalization of the generalized Brillouin zone. Our results establish a diagrammatic framework for dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect in a description of full-fledged Lindblad master equations, which resembles Fermi liquid theory in terms of interaction-dressed quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non-heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and (de-)confinement. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While methods based on density-functional perturbation theory have dramatically improved our understanding of electron-phonon contributions to transport in materials, methods for accurately capturing electron-electron scattering relevant to low temperatures have seen significantly less development. The case of high-conductivity, moderately correlated materials characterized by low scattering rates is particularly challenging, since exquisite numerical precision of the low-energy electronic structure is required. Recent methodological advancements to density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), including adaptive Brillouin-zone integration and numerically precise self-energies, enable a rigorous investigation of electron-electron scattering in such materials. In particular, these tools may be leveraged to perform a robust scattering-rate analysis on both real- and imaginary-frequency axes. Applying this methodology to a subset of ABO$_3$ perovskite oxides -- SrVO$_3$, SrMoO$_3$, PbMoO$_3$, and SrRuO$_3$ -- we demonstrate its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively describe electron-electron contributions to the temperature-dependent direct-current resistivity. This combination of numerical techniques offers fundamental insight into the role of electronic correlations in transport phenomena and provides a predictive tool for identifying materials with potential for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electronic nematic order that originates from superconducting fluctuation but persists above the superconducting transition temperature is often referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. Such a vestigial order belongs to the broader class of composite orders discussed in earlier literature, characterized by ordering in gauge-invariant combinations of superconducting order parameters while the individual superconducting order parameters remain disordered. These states include metallic superfluids, paired phases, and composite (charge-4e) superconductors. Whether and under what conditions such a vestigial phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors remains an open question. Recent analytical work [P. T. How and S. K. Yip, Phys. Rev. B 107, 104514 (2023)] concluded that vestigial nematic phases--and related mechanisms--do not appear in the widely studied models proposed for, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based candidates. To shed light on this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of How and Yip, our numerical results confirm that commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. Extending the analysis to include coupling to a gauge field, we show that vestigial nematic order can, under restrictive conditions, be stabilized through an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by the gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Fixed-Point Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{fixed-point BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and topological properties of tellurium across its dimensional hierarchy, including bulk trigonal Te-I, two-dimensional tellurene polymorphs, and one-dimensional helical nanowires. Using density functional theory with full inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, we confirm that bulk Te-I is a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes arising from broken inversion symmetry and degenerate phonon modes suggestive of chiral phonon behavior. In contrast, two-dimensional alpha and beta-tellurene are found to be topologically trivial, with no spin-orbit-driven band inversion in the occupied manifold. Beyond these established phases, we find that buckled kagome and buckled square tellurene lattices exhibit a nontrivial two-dimensional topology of the occupied electronic bands, indicating incipient quantum spin Hall character in metallic systems. In contrast, one-side hydrogen-passivated hexagonal tellurene realizes a fully gapped quantum spin Hall phase with a robust Z2 = 1 invariant, preserved under applied strain and chemical functionalization. In the one-dimensional limit, helical tellurium nanowires preserve chirality and host edge-localized states accompanied by pronounced anisotropy in carrier effective masses. These results establish tellurium as a highly tunable platform for engineering topological phenomena across dimensionality, bridging three-dimensional Weyl physics, two-dimensional quantum spin Hall and incipient Z2 phases, and one-dimensional helical systems.</description>

By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal hydrodynamics and the holographic product formula</title>

Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</description>
