      <title>Faithfulness and fractal (quasi-)equivalence principles for Perron, Engel, and Pierce expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several unifying principles that clarify the fractal properties of classical number expansions, which are generalized by the Perron expansions. In particular, we prove the fractal equivalence principle for the positive and alternating Perron expansions, the fractal quasi-equivalence principle for the classical and modified Engel expansions, and the fractal quasi-equivalence principle for the Pierce expansions in the Perron and traditional notations. These results explain several known analogies and show that the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by one expansion often coincides with that for another. The proofs rely on faithful families of coverings, for which we refine previously known estimates. In addition to deriving a range of known theorems as direct corollaries of previous results, our approach yields new fractal properties of the Engel and Pierce expansions and provides a systematic framework for transferring Hausdorff dimension properties between different expansions.</description>

      <title>Gross's conjecture: the dihedral case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$ carry a surprisingly rich arithmetic structure. For example, they have a theory of Fourier expansions where the Fourier coefficients are indexed by totally real cubic rings. For quaternionic modular forms on $\mathsf{G}_2$ associated via functoriality with certain modular forms on $\mathrm{PGL}_2$, Gross conjectured in 2000 that their Fourier coefficients encode $L$-values of cubic twists of the modular form (echoing Waldspurger's work on Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight modular forms). We prove Gross's conjecture when the modular forms are dihedral, giving the first examples for which it is known.</description>

      <title>Scattered Behavior Using Modified Cyclotomic Mapping Over Finite Fields Of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced by Sheekey in 2016, the study of scattered polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ has been increasing regarding the classification of those that are \textit{exceptional}, i.e., polynomials which are scattered over infinite field extensions, are limited to the cases where their index $t$ is small, or a prime number larger than the q-degree k of the polynomial, or an integer smaller than k in the case where k is a prime. In this paper, we focus on the scattered behavior of $S(x)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix^{q^{r_i}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime, $0&lt;r_1&lt;r_2&lt; \cdots&lt;r_k&lt;n$ and $a_1, \cdots,a_k \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that the order of $a_i$'s divide $(q^{r_1}-1)$, $\forall i=2,3,\cdots,k $. We explore a connection between $S(x)$ and the cyclotomic mapping polynomial. As an application, in three parts, we discuss the scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $t$ where $t=r_1$, or $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$, or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. Starting with the pseudoregulus type of index $t \geq 0$, we present conditions to verify scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $r_1$. With some additional conditions, we do the same in case $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$ or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. In particular, for $S(x)=a_1x^{q^{r_1}}+a_2x^{q^{r_2}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ with $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that $|a_2| \mid q^{r_1}-1$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to verify its scattered behavior of index $t \in \{r_1,r_2\}$. We also connect such scattered binomials with the well known \textit{Lunardon-Polverino} polynomial. With conditions on $\delta, q,n$, and $r$; we present a new family of \textit{exceptional scattered polynomial} $S(x)=x^q+\delta x^{q^{(2r+1)}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ of index $\{r+1\}$.</description>

      <title>On Milnor $K$-theory in the imperfect residue case and applications to period-index problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called pseudo-perfect extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$. This bound is sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh.</description>

      <title>Elliptic curves and rational points in arithmetic progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We consider finite sequences of rational points $\{P_1,\ldots,P_N\}$ whose $x$-coordinates form an arithmetic progression in $\mathbb{Q}$. Under the assumption of Lang's conjecture on lower bounds for canonical height functions, we prove that the length $N$ of such sequences satisfies the upper bound $\ll A^r$, where $A$ is an absolute constant and $r$ is the Mordell-Weil rank of $E/\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, assuming the uniform boundedness of ranks of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, the length $N$ satisfies a uniform upper bound independent of $E$.</description>

      <title>A class of Drinfeld $A$-modules of rank $3$ with surjective Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q = p^e \geq 7$ be an odd prime power, and set $A := \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. In this article, we construct an infinite two-parameter family of Drinfeld $A$-modules of rank $3$ such that, for every non-zero prime ideal $\mathfrak{l}$ of $A$, the associated mod-$\mathfrak{l}$, $\mathfrak{l}$-adic, and adelic Galois representations are surjective. These results generalise the specific example, constructed only for primes $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$, in~\cite{Che22}.</description>

      <title>Note on shifted primes with large prime factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $0&lt;c&lt;1$ let
  $$
  T_c(x)=|\big\{p\le x: p\in \mathbb{P}, P^+(p-1)\ge p^c\big\}|,
  $$
  where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of primes and $P^+(n)$ denotes the largest prime factor of $n$. Erd\H os proved in 1935 that
  $$
  \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as~}c\rightarrow 1,
  $$
  where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Recently, Ding gave a quantitative form of Erd\H os' result and showed that for $8/9&lt; c&lt;1$ we have
  $$
  \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\le 8\big(c^{-1}-1\big).
  $$
  In this article, Ding's bound is improved to
  $$
  \limsup_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_c(x)/\pi(x)\le -\frac{7}{2}\log c
  $$
  for $e^{-\frac{2}{7}}&lt; c&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic holonomy bounds and effective Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore several threads arising from our recent joint work on arithmetic holonomy bounds, which were originally devised to prove new irrationality results based on the method of Ap\'ery limits. We propose a new method to address effective Diophantine approximation on the projective line and the multiplicative group. This method, and all our other results in the paper, emerged from quantifying our holonomy bounds in a way that directly yields effective measures of irrationality and linear independence. Applying these to a dihedral algebraic construction, we derive good effective irrationality measures for high order roots of an algebraic number, in an approach that might be considered a multivalent continuation of the classical hypergeometric method of Thue, Siegel, and Baker. A well-known Dirichlet approximation argument of Bombieri allows one to derive from this the classical effective Diophantine theorems, hitherto only approachable by Baker's linear forms in logarithms or by Bombieri's equivariant Thue--Siegel method. These include the algorithmic resolution of the two-variable $S$-unit equation, the Thue--Mahler equation, and the hyperelliptic and superelliptic equations, as well as the Baker--Feldman effective power sharpening of Liouville's theorem. We also give some other applications, including irrationality measures for the classical $L(2,\chi_{-3})$ and the $2$-adic $\zeta(5)$, and a new proof of the transcendence of $\pi$. Due to space limitations, a full development of these ideas will be deferred to future work.</description>

      <title>On quaternionic ordinary families of modular forms and $p$-adic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Serre--Tate expansions of modular forms to construct power series attached to quaternionic ordinary families of modular forms. We associate to these power series a big $p$-adic $L$-function interpolating the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Burungale and Magrone at classical specializations. A crucial ingredient is the generalization of some results of Ohta to the quaternionic setting.</description>

Abstract: Following up a previous article of the authors which studies the interpolation of certain anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions associated to quaternionic modular forms in a Hida family, we extend the work of F. Castella on the interpolation and specialization of big Heegner points to the quaternionic setting. We prove an explicit reciprocity law relating the big $p$-adic $L$-function to the big Heegner points in this quaternionic setting.</description>

      <title>Reducibility and rational torsion in modular abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let N be a square-free positive integer and let f be a newform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N). Let A denote the abelian subvariety of J_0(N) associated to f and let m be a maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra T that contains Ann_T(f) and has residue characteristic r such that r does not divide 6N. We show that if either A[m] or the canonical representation \rho_m over T/m associated to m is reducible, then r divides the order of the cuspidal subgroup of J_0(N) and A[m] has a nontrivial rational point. We mention some applications of this result, including an application to the second part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for A.</description>

      <title>Sums of the floor function related to class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curious identity of Bunyakovsky (1882), made more widely known by P\'olya and Szeg{\H o} in their ``Problems and Theorems in Analysis", gives an evaluation of a sum of the floor function of square roots involving primes $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$. We evaluate this sum also in the case $p\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, obtaining an identity in terms of the class number of the imaginary quadratic field ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-p})$. We also consider certain cases where the prime $p$ is replaced by a composite integer. Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields are again involved in some cases.</description>

      <title>Mock modular forms from the k-rank moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the generating functions of Garvans so-called $k$-ranks are used, to define a family of mock Eisenstein series. The $k$-rank moments are then expressed as partition traces of these functions. We explore the modular properties of this new family, give recursive formulas for them involving divisor like sums, and prove that their Fourier coefficient are integral. Furthermore, we show that these functions lie in an algebra that is generated only by derivatives up to a finite order but is nevertheless closed under differentiation. In the process, we also answer a question raised by Bringmann, Pandey and van Ittersum by showing that the divisor like sum $$\left(1-2^{\ell-1} \right) \frac{B_\ell}{2\ell}+ \sum_{2n-1 \geq bm \geq b} (2n-bm)^{\ell-1} q^{mn} - \sum_{m-1 \geq 2bn \geq 2b} (m-2bn)^{\ell-1} q^{mn},$$ has a quasi-completion, when $b\geq 3$ is odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(x, y)$ and $[x, y]$ denote the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of the integers $x$ and $y$ respectively. We denote by $|T|$ the number of elements of a finite set $T$. Let $a,b$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $S=\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. We denote by $(S^a)$ (resp. $[S^a]$) the $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is the $a$th power of $(x_i,x_j)$ (resp. $[x_i,x_j]$). For any $x\in S$, define $G_{S}(x):=\{d\in S: d&lt;x, d|x \ {\rm and} \ (d|y|x, y\in S)\Rightarrow y\in \{d,x\}\}$. In this paper, we show that if $a|b$ and $S$ is gcd closed (namely, $(x_i, x_j)\in S$ for all integers $i$ and $j$ with $1\le i, j\le n$) and $\max_{x\in S}\{|G_S (x)|\}=2$ and the condition $\mathcal{G}$ being satisfied (i.e., any element $x\in S$ satisfies that either $|G_S(x)|\le 1$, or $G_S(x)=\{y_1,y_2\}$ satisfying that $[y_1,y_2]=x$ and $(y_1,y_2)\in G_S(y_1)\cap G_S(y_2)$), then $(S^a)|(S^b), (S^a)|[S^b]$ and $[S^a]|[S^b]$ hold in the ring $M_{n}({\bf Z})$. Furthermore, we show the existences of gcd-closed sets $S$ such that $S$ does not satisfy the condition $\mathcal{G}$ and such factorizations are true. Our result extends the Feng-Hong-Zhao theorem gotten in 2009. This also partially confirms a conjecture raised by Hong in [S.F. Hong, Divisibility among power GCD matrices and power LCM matrices, {\it Bull. Aust. Math. Soc.}, doi:10.1017/S0004972725100361].</description>

      <title>Serre weight conjectures for $\mathrm{GSp}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the weight part of Serre's conjecture for Galois representations valued in $\mathrm{GSp}_4$ that are tamely ramified with explicit genericity at places above $p$ as conjectured by Herzig--Tilouine and Gee--Herzig--Savitt. This improves on arXiv:2304.13879 where an inexplicit genericity hypothesis was required. As an application, we prove a modularity lifting theorem for $\mathrm{GSp}_4$ under similar assumptions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a construction of radial Fourier interpolation formulas in dimensions 3 and 4 using Maass--Poincar\'e type series. As a corollary we obtain explicit formulas for the basis functions of these interpolation formulas in terms of what we call real-variable Kloosterman sums, which were previously introduced by Stoller. We also improve the bounds on the corresponding basis functions $a_{n,d}(x)$, $d=3,4$, for fixed $x$, in terms of the index $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the modularity of mixed periods associated with singular fibers of specific families of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This is done by "fibering out", i.e. by expressing these periods as integrals of periods of families of K3 surfaces and by using modularity properties of the latter. Besides classical periods of holomorphic modular forms and meromorphic modular forms with vanishing residues, the computations lead to new interesting periods associated with meromorphic modular forms with non-vanishing residues as well as contours between CM points.</description>

      <title>$q$-Hodge complexes over the Habiro ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack.
  While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <title>The functional Loomis-Whitney type inequality in the Heisenberg groups and Projection theorems over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a functional Loomis--Whitney framework on the finite Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and discover connections to the boundedness and orthogonal projection problems. For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely \[ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, \] which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent \[ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, \] via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0810.5176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let N be a positive integer and let f be a newform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N). In earlier joint work with K. Ribet and W. Stein, we introduced the notions of the modular number and the congruence number of the quotient abelian variety A_f of J_0(N) associated to the newform f. These invariants are analogs of the notions of the modular degree and congruence primes respectively associated to elliptic curves. We show that if p is a prime such that every maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra of characteristic p that contains the annihilator ideal of f satisfies multiplicity one, then the modular number and the congruence number have the same p-adic valuation.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field and let $\pi \colon X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^1$ be a smooth conic bundle. We show that if $X/k$ has four geometric singular fibers with $X(\mathbb{A}_k)\neq \emptyset$ or non-trivial Brauer group, then $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over any even degree extension $L/k$. Furthermore for arbitrary $X$ we show that, conditional on Schinzel's hypothesis, $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over all but finitely many quadratic extensions of $k$. We prove these results by showing the Brauer-Manin obstruction vanishes and then apply fibration method results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene, following Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc.</description>

      <title>On the Galois structure of units in totally real $p$-rational number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of factor-equivalence of integral lattices establishes a far-reaching relationship between the Galois module structure of the unit group of the ring of integers of a number field and its arithmetic. For a number field $K$ that is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ or an imaginary quadratic field, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition on the quotients of class numbers of subfields of $K$, for the quotient $E_{K}$ of the unit group of the ring of integers of $K$ modulo the subgroup of roots of unity to be factor equivalent to the standard cyclic Galois module. Using strong arithmetic properties of totally real $p$-rational number fields, we prove that the non-abelian $p$-rational $p$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ do not admit Minkowski units, thereby extending a result of Burns to non-abelian number fields. We also study the relative Galois module structure of $E_{L}$ for varying Galois extensions $L/F$ of totally real $p$-rational number fields whose Galois groups are isomorphic to a fixed finite group $G$. In that case, we prove that there exists a finite set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices such that for every $L$, $\mathbb{Z}_{p} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} E_{L}$ is factor equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[G]^{n} \oplus X$ as $\mathbb{Z}_p[G]$-lattices for some $X \in \Omega$ and an integer $n \geq 0$.</description>

Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

Here we have found the torsion of the two families of elliptic curves to find the solutions of given Diophantine equations. Moreover, we also calculate the rank of these two families of elliptic curves over the Gaussian field $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to explore the Euler system of Beilinson--Kato elements in families passing through the critical $p$-stabilization of an Eisenstein series attached to two Dirichlet characters $(\psi,\tau)$. In this context, we establish an explicit connection with the system of circular units, utilizing suitable factorization formulas in a situation where several of the $p$-adic $L$-functions vanish. In that regard, our main results may be seen as an Euler system incarnation of the factorization formula of Bella\"iche and Dasgupta. One of the most significant aspects is that, depending on the parity of $\psi$ and $\tau$, different phenomena arise; while some can be addressed with our methods, others pose new questions. Finally, we discuss analogous results in the framework of Beilinson--Flach classes.</description>

Abstract: Let A be an abelian threefold defined over a number field K with potential multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field M. If A has signature (2,1) and the multiplication by M is defined over an at most quadratic extension, we attach to A an elliptic curve defined over K with potential complex multiplication by M, whose attached Galois representation is determined by the Hecke character associated to the determinant of the compatible system of lambda-adic representations of A. We deduce that if the geometric endomorphism algebra of A is an imaginary quadratic field, then it necessarily has class number bounded by [K:Q].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$ with integer coefficients, we establish two results on Diophantine approximation with integers represented by $Q$. Firstly, we show that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by $Q$ and satisfying $||\alpha n||&lt;n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This is an easy consequence of a result by Cook on small fractional parts of diagonal quadratic forms. Secondly, we give a quantitative version with a lower bound of this result when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by any fixed $\gamma&lt;3/7$. To this end, we use the Voronoi summation formula and a bound for bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums to fixed moduli by Kerr, Shparlinski, Wu and Xi.</description>

      <title>On the Family of Elliptic Curves $y^2=x^3-5pqx$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the family of elliptic curves given by $E_{pq}: y^2=x^3-5pqx$ and certain conditions on odd primed $p$ and $q$. More specifically, we have proved that if $p \equiv 33 \pmod {40}$ and $ q \equiv 7 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{pq}$ is zero over both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the primes $ p $ and $q$ are of the form $ 40k + 33 $ and $ 40l + 27$, where $k,l \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(25k+ 5l +21)$ is a perfect square, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Finally, we have shown that torsion of $E_{pq}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $ \mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of analytic torsion for congruence quotients of $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SO}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic torsion of congruence quotients of $\SL(n,\R)/\SO(n)$ in terms of the volume. The result is based on bounds on the trace of the heat kernel, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda&gt;0$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups.</description>

      <title>Diophantine approximation with sums of two squares II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we showed that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$, satisfying $||\alpha n||&lt;n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We also provided a quantitative version with a lower bound when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by weaker exponent $\gamma&lt;3/7-\varepsilon$. In this article we recover this quantitative version with the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$, but now for the particular case of sums of two squares.</description>

      <title>Symplectic criteria for elliptic curves, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ and $p \geq 3$ be different primes. Let $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ be elliptic curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion. Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterl\'e.
  We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it.
  As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.</description>

      <title>Lacunary sequences whose reciprocal sums represent all rationals in an interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering a question of Michael Bleicher and Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

      <title>Closed exact categories of modules over generalized adic rings. Part 1: The bounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop general foundations of topological algebra over a linearly topologized ring k in a format applicable to both formal schemes and analytic adic spaces. We are especially interested in determining quasi-abelian categories of complete linearly topologized k-modules, which are also closed symmetric monoidal for a suitable choice of tensor product and internal Hom, and have enough projectives or injectives. For k a suitably generalized adic ring, we describe here a few examples of such categories consisting of bounded modules.</description>

      <title>Formulas involving Cauchy polynomials, Bernoulli polynomials, and generalized Stirling numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13696v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive novel formulas and identities connecting Cauchy numbers and polynomials with both ordinary and generalized Stirling numbers, binomial coefficients, central factorial numbers, Euler polynomials, $r$-Whitney numbers, and hyperharmonic polynomials, as well as Bernoulli numbers and polynomials. We also provide formulas for the higher-order derivatives of Cauchy polynomials and obtain corresponding formulas and identities for poly-Cauchy polynomials. Furthermore, we introduce a multiparameter framework for poly-Cauchy polynomials, unifying earlier generalizations like shifted poly-Cauchy numbers and polynomials with a $q$ parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a finite cyclic extension of local fields of characteristic zero, of degree $d$, and $\kappa$ be a character of $F^\times$ whose kernel is $\mathrm{N}_{E/F}(E^\times)$. For $m\in \mathbb{N}^*$, we prove that every irreducible unitary representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m(E)$ has a $\kappa$-lift to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(F)$, given by a character identity as in Henniart-Herb [HH]. Let ${\bf E}/{\bf F}$ be a finite cyclic extension of number fields, of degree $d$, and $\mathfrak{K}$ be a character of $\mathbb{A}_{\bf F}^\times$ whose kernel is ${\bf F}^\times \mathrm{N}_{{\bf E}/{\bf F}}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E}^\times)$. We prove that every automorphic discrete representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E})$ has a (strong) $\mathfrak{K}$-lift to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf F})$, i.e. compatible with the local lifting maps. We describe the image and the fibres of these local and global lifting maps. Locally, we also treat the elliptic representations.</description>
