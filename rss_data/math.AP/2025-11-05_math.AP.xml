      <title>Magnetically Insulated Diode: Existence of Solutions and Complex Bifurcation. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to avoid the electron oscillation of the cathode and enhance the work efficiency of a vacuum diode, an approach for analyzing the solutions and complex bifurcation has been proposed and used to determine the optimal trajectory of electron motion of the vacuum diode. This work is focusing on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation in a space-charge-limited vacuum diode, modeled by a singularly perturbed 1.5-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system. We focus on the insulated regime, characterized by the reflection of electrons back toward the cathode at a point $x^{*}.$ The analysis proceeds in two primary stages. First, the original Vlasov-Maxwell system is reduced to a nonlinear singular system of ordinary differential equations governing the electric and magnetic field potentials. Subsequently, this system is further reduced to a novel nonlinear singular ODE for an effective potential $\theta(x).$ The existence of non-negative solutions to this final equation is established on the interval $[0, x^{*})$, where $\theta(x)&gt;0$. This is achieved by reformulating the associated initial value problem into a system of coupled nonlinear Fredholm integral equations and proving the existence of fixed points for the corresponding operators. The most significant and previously unexplored case occurs when $\theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$, which corresponds to the fully insulated diode. For this regime, we present a novel numerical analysis of complex solution bifurcations, examining their dependence on system parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams illustrating the solution $\theta(x)$ as a function of the free boundary $x^{*}$ is constructed, and the insulated diode spacing is determined.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions to some singular parabolic free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct nonnegative weak solutions to the singular parabolic free boundary problem \[ \partial_t u - \Delta u = - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} u} u_+^\gamma , \] where $\gamma \in (0,1]$, $u_+ := \max\{u,0\}$, and the term in the right-hand side denotes the formal derivative of the non-smooth function $u \mapsto u_+^\gamma$. Weak solutions are obtained as limits of a suitable approximation procedure. We show uniform optimal regularity, optimal growth and nondegeneracy estimates, and a Weiss-type monotonicity formula for solutions to the approximating problem. Such uniform estimates are then passed to limit: we prove the existence of a class of weak solutions to the free boundary problem which is closed under blow-up and whose weak formulation encodes the sharp free boundary condition. Finally, we construct several examples of weak solutions with self-similar and traveling wave form.</description>

      <title>Gradient bounds for viscosity solutions to certain elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our principal object of study is the modulus of continuity of a periodic or uniformly vanishing function \( u: \mathbb{R} ^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) which satisfies a degenerate elliptic equation \( F(x, u, \nabla u, D^{2} u) = 0 \) in the viscosity sense. The equations under consideration here have second-order terms of the form \( -{\rm Trace} \, (\mathcal{A} (\|\nabla u \|) \cdot D^{2} u) , \) where \( \mathcal{A} \) is an \( n\times n\) matrix which is symmetric and positive semi-definite. Following earlier work, \cite{Li21}, of the second author, which addressed the parabolic case, we identify a one-dimensional equation for which the modulus of continuity is a subsolution. In favorable cases, this one-dimensional operator can be used to derive a gradient bound on $u$ or to draw other conclusions about the nature of the solution.</description>

      <title>Limited-Range Multilinear Off-Diagonal Extrapolation and Weighted Transference Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilinear $L^p$ extrapolation results are established in a limited-range, multilinear, and off-diagonal setting for mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces over $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. Integrability exponents are allowed in the full range $(0,\infty]$. We detach the exponents for the weight classes completely from the exponents for the initial and target spaces for the extrapolation except for the basic consistency condition. This enables to cover the full range $(0,\infty]$ for all integrability exponents and provides new insights into the dependency of the extrapolated bounds on the weight characteristic. Certain endpoint results are new even for $\mathbb{R}^d$. Additionally, in the setting of compact abelian groups, a weighted transference principle is established.</description>

      <title>A new approach for the analysis of evolution partial differential equations on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for certain evolution partial differential equations, the solution on a finite interval $(0,\ell)$ can be reconstructed as a superposition of restrictions to $(0,\ell)$ of solutions to two associated partial differential equations posed on the half-lines $(0,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,\ell)$. Determining the appropriate data for these half-line problems amounts to solving an inverse problem, which we formulate via the unified transform of Fokas (also known as the Fokas method) and address via a fixed point argument in $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces, including fractional ones through interpolation techniques. We illustrate our approach through two canonical examples, the heat equation and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and provide numerical simulations for the former example. We further demonstrate that the new approach extends to more general evolution partial differential equations, including those with time-dependent coefficients. A key outcome of this work is that spatial and temporal regularity estimates for problems on a finite interval can be directly derived from the corresponding estimates on the half-line. These results can, in turn, be used to establish local well-posedness for related nonlinear problems, as the essential ingredients are the linear estimates within nonlinear frameworks.</description>

      <title>On the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac Equation for Hard Potential: Global Existence and Uniqueness, Gaussian Lower Bound, and Moment Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global existence and uniqueness, Gaussian lower bound, and moment estimates in the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Fermi-Dirac particles for hard potential ($0\leq \gamma\leq 2$) with angular cutoff $b$. Our results extend classical results to the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac setting. In detail, (1) we show existence, uniqueness, and $L^1_2$ stability of global-in-time solutions of the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac equation. (2) Assuming the solution is not a saturated equilibrium, we prove creation of a Gaussian lower bound for the solution. (3) We prove creation and propagation of $L^1$ polynomial and exponential moments of the solution under additional assumptions on the angular kernel $b$ and $0&lt;\gamma\leq 2$. (4) Finally, we show propagation of $L^\infty$ Gaussian and polynomial upper bounds when $b$ is constant and $0&lt;\gamma\leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Uniform stability and optimal time decay rates of the compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes system in the critical regularity framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. Unlike the standard isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system, the density in the pressureless model lacks a dissipative mechanism, leading to significant coupling effects from nonlinear terms in the momentum equations. We first prove the global well-posedness and uniform stability of strong solutions to the compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes system in the critical Besov space $\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\frac{d}{2}} \times \dot{B}_{2,1}^{\frac{d}{2}-1}$. Then, under the additional assumption that the low-frequency component of the initial density belongs to $\dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{\sigma_0+1}$ and that the initial velocity is sufficiently small in $\dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{\sigma_0}$ with $\sigma_0 \in (-\frac{d}{2}, \frac{d}{2}-1]$, we overcome the challenge of derivative loss caused by nonlinearity and establish optimal decay estimates for $u$ in $\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\sigma}$ with $\sigma \in (\sigma_0, \frac{d}{2}+1]$. In particular, it is shown that the density remains uniformly bounded in time which reveals a new asymptotic behavior in contrast to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system where the density exhibits a dissipative structure and decays over time.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for generalized fractional Hartree equations with rough initial data in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global existence of the solution for fractional Hartree equations with initial data in certain real interpolation spaces between $L^{2}$ and some kinds of new function spaces defined by fractional Schr\"odinger semigroup, which could imply the global well-posedness of the equation in modulation spaces $M_{p,p'}^{s_{p}}$ for $p$ close to 2 with no smallness condition on initial data, where $s_{p}=(m-2)(1/2-1/p)$. The proof adapts a splitting method inspired by the work of Hyakuna-Tsutsumi, Chaichenets et al. to the modulation spaces and exploits polynomial growth of the fractional Schr\"odinger semi-group on modulation spaces $M_{p,p'}$ with loss of regularity $s_{p}$.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness for the 2D and 3D Prandtl-Shercliff Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Prandtl-Shercliff model in both two and three dimensions. For the two-dimensional case, we establish global-in-time well-posedness in Sobolev spaces without any structural assumptions on the initial data. Furthermore, we show that the solution exhibits an analytic regularization effect in all variables, which holds globally in time and in space up to the boundary. For the three-dimensional case, we study a linearized version of the model and prove its global-in-time well-posedness for initial data that are analytic in only one tangential direction. The proofs rely crucially on the intrinsic non-local diffusion induced by the Shercliff boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Local asymptotics for the nonlocal Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlocal-to-local asymptotics investigation for evolutionary problems is a central topic both in the theory of PDEs and in functional analysis. More recently, it became the main core of the mathematical analysis of phase-separation models. In this paper we focus on the Swift-Hohenberg equations which are key benchmark models in pattern formation problems and amplitude equations. We prove well-posedness of the nonlocal Swift-Hohenberg equation, and study the nonlocal-to-local asymptotics with one and two nonlocal contributions under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions using suitable energy estimates on the nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>Two-way Coupling of Fluid--Structure Interaction for Elastic Magneto-Swimmers:A Finite Element ALE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial micro-swimmers actuated by external magnetic fields hold significant promise for targeted biomedical applications, including drug delivery and micro-robot-assisted therapy. However, their dynamics remain challenging to control due to the complex nonlinear coupling between magnetic actuation, elastic deformations, and fluid interactions in confined biological environments. Numerical modeling is therefore essential to better understand, predict, and optimize their behavior for practical applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive finite element framework based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian formulation to simulate deformable elastic micro-swimmers in confined fluid domains. The method employs a full-order model that resolves the complete fluid dynamics while simultaneously tracking swimmer deformation and global displacement on conforming meshes. Numerical experiments are performed with the open-source finite element library Feel++, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental data from the literature. The validation benchmarks in both two and three dimensions confirm the accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the proposed framework, representing a foundational step toward developing digital twins of magneto-swimmers for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Calder\'{o}n problem for a logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger operator of order $2+$ on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the anisotropic Calder\'on problems for the non local logarithimic Schr\"odinger operators $(-\Delta_g+m)\log{(-\Delta_g+m)}+V$ with $m&gt;1$ on a closed, connected, smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq2$. We will show that, for the operator $(-\Delta_g+m)\log{(-\Delta_g+m)}+V$, the recovery of both the Riemannian metric and the potential is possible from the Cauchy data, in the setting of a common underlying manifold with varying metrics. This result is unconditional. The last result can be extended to the case of setwise distinct manifolds also. In particular, we demonstrate that for setwise distinct manifolds, the Cauchy data associated with the operator $(-\Delta_g+m)\log{(-\Delta_g+m)}+V$, measured on a suitable non-empty open subset, uniquely determines the Riemannian manifold up to isometry and the potential up to an appropriate gauge transformation. This particular result is unconditional when the potential is supported entirely within the observation set. In the more general setting-where the potential may take nonzero values outside the observation set-specific geometric assumptions are required on both the observation set and the unknown region of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Self-similar blow-up solutions for the supercritical parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the self-similar solutions presenting finite time blow-up to the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ in dimension $N\geq3$ and the range of exponents $$ \sigma\in(-2,\infty), \quad p&gt;p_S(\sigma):=\frac{N+2\sigma+2}{N-2}. $$ We establish the \emph{existence of self-similar blow-up solutions for any $p&gt;p_S(\sigma)$}, provided $\sigma\geq2$. Moreover, we prove that, if $k$ is any natural number and $\sigma\geq 4k-2$, the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation has at least $k$ different self-similar blow-up solutions for any $p&gt;p_S(\sigma)$. These results are in a stark contrast with the standard reaction-diffusion equation $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u+u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ for which non-existence of any self-similar solution has been established, provided $p$ overpasses the Lepin exponent $p_L:=1+\frac{6}{N-10}$, $N\geq11$.
  For $\sigma\in(-2,2)$, we derive the expression of generalized Lepin exponents $p_L(\sigma)$ for $\sigma\in(0,2)$, respectively $\overline{p_L}(\sigma)$ for $\sigma\in(-2,0)$, and prove existence of self-similar solutions with finite time blow-up for $p\in(p_S(\sigma),p_L(\sigma))$, respectively $p\in(p_S(\sigma),\overline{p_L}(\sigma))$. Numerical evidence of the optimality of these exponents is also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem to systems with $p$-growth structure with $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, whose prototype is \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u- \operatorname{div} \big( |Du|^{p-2} Du \big) = \operatorname{div} \left( |F|^{p-2} F \right), \end{equation*} in a bounded noncylindrical domain $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. For $p&gt; \frac{2(n+1)}{n+2}$ and domains $E$ that satisfy suitable regularity assumptions and do not grow or shrink too fast, we prove global higher integrability of $Du$. The result is already new in the case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>A Monotonicity formula for almost self-similar suitable weak solutions to the stationary Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb R^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a suitable weak solution to the stationary Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb R^5$, cannot behave like a self-similar function of degree negative one if the lower limit of the local Reynolds number is finite.
  To prove the result we develop a method that uses a monotonicity formula approach, classification of homogenous solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb R^5$, and a projection theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new aspects of the the of numerosity theory; more exactly, we emphasize its relation with the ordinal numbers, cardinal numbers, hyperreal numbers and surreal numbers. In particular, we combine the notion of numerosity with the idea of continuum and we get a definition of Euclidean line which includes all the sets of infinite numbers mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Revisited for existence proof of optimal solution in Bernoulli free boundary problem using an energy-gap cost functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernoulli free boundary problem is numerically solved via shape optimization that minimizes a cost functional subject to state problems constraints. In \cite{1}, an energy-gap cost functional was formulated based on two auxiliary state problems, with existence of optimal solution attempted through continuity of state problems with respect to the domain. Nevertheless, there exists a corrigendum in Eq.(48) in \cite{1}, where the boundedness of solution sequences for state problems with respect to the domain cannot be directly estimated via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as \textbf{Claimed}. In this comment, we rectify this proof by Poincar\'e-Friedrichs inequality.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the 2D primitive equations with fractional horizontal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional incompressible primitive equations with fractional horizontal dissipation. Specifically, we establish global well-posedness of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data when the dissipation exponent satisfies $\alpha\geq\alpha_{0}\approx1.1108$. In addition, we prove global well-posedness of strong solutions for small initial data when $\alpha \in [1, \alpha_0)$. Notably, the smallness assumption is imposed only on the $L^\infty$ norm of the initial vorticity.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions of fractional differential equations in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilising the notion of measures of non-compactness and Kamke function of order $\alpha$, we address the question of solvability of fractional differential equations in Banach spaces. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of a local solution. Our main existence theorem is then applied on countable systems of fractional differential equations arising from semi-discretisation of fractional PDEs with $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature and bounded geometry, and let $\Sigma$ be a uniformly embedded submanifold of $M.$ We estimate the $L^2(M)\to L^q(\Sigma)$ norm of a $\log$-scale spectral projection operator. It is a generalization of result of X. Chen to noncompact cases. We also prove sharp spectral projection estimates of spectral windows of any small size restricted to nontrapped geodesics on even asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces with bounded geometry and curvature pinched below 0.</description>

Abstract: We show that integral curvature energies on surfaces of the type $E_0(M) := \int_M f(x,n_M(x),D n_M(x))\,d\mathcal{H}^2(x)$ have discrete versions for triangular complexes, where the shape operator $D n_M$ is replaced by the piecewise gradient of a piecewise affine edge director field. We combine an ansatz-free asymptotic lower bound for any uniform approximation of a surface with triangular complexes and a recovery sequence consisting of any regular triangulation of the limit sequence and an almost optimal choice of edge director.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, multiplicity and the asymptotic behavior of prescribed mass solutions to the following nonlinear Kirchhoff equation with mixed nonlinearities:

  \int_{\Omega}|u|^2\mathrm{d}x=\alpha,
  both on large bounded smooth star-shaped domain \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3} and on \mathbb{R}^{3}, where 2&lt;p&lt;\frac{14}{3}&lt;q&lt;6 and V(x) is the potential. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain normalized solutions is invalid due to the presence of potential V(x).</description>

Abstract: We consider an elliptic system of Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky type in a bounded and smooth domain of R3 with a non constant coupling factor. This kind of system has been introduced in the mathematical literature in [14] and in the last years many contributions appeared. In particular here we present the results in [2] and [34] which show existence of solutions by means of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory under different boundary conditions on the electrostatic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalized solutions of an evolutionary equation related to a densely defined skew-symmetric operator in a real Hilbert space. We establish existence of a contractive semigroup, which provides generalized solutions, and find criteria of uniqueness of generalized solutions. Some applications are given including the transport equations and the linearised Euler equations with solenoidal (and generally discontinuous) coefficients. Under some additional regularity assumption on the coefficients we prove that the corresponding spatial operators are skew-adjoint, which implies existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions for both the forward and the backward Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Existence results for variational quasilinear elliptic systems involving the vectorial $p$-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence and regularity results for the following elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\textbf{div}(|D\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}D\boldsymbol{u})=\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u}) &amp; \text{in } \Omega \\ \boldsymbol{u}=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\boldsymbol{u}=(u^1,\dots,u^m)$, $p&gt;1$, and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain. We also consider the special case
  \[\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u})=\lambda|\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}\boldsymbol{u}+|\boldsymbol{u}|^{q-2}\boldsymbol{u},\] and we prove a classification result. In particular, we show that any least energy solution is of the form $(c^1\omega,\dots,c^m\omega)$, where $\boldsymbol{c}=(c^1,\dots,c^m)\in S^{m-1}$ (the $(m-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb R^m$) and $\omega$ is a positive solution of the corresponding scalar equation.</description>

      <title>Complete spectrum of the Robin eigenvalue problem on the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following Robin eigenvalue problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u=\mu u\,\, &amp;\text{in}\,\, B,\\ \partial_\texttt{n} u+\alpha u=0 &amp;\text{on}\,\, \partial B \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} on the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$. We obtain the complete spectral structure of this problem. In particular, for $\alpha&gt;0$, the first eigenvalue is $k_{\nu,1}^2$ and the second eigenvalue is $k_{\nu+1,1}^2$, where $k_{\nu+l,m}$ is the $m$th positive zero of $kJ_{\nu+l+1}(k)-(\alpha+l) J_{\nu+l}(k)$. Moreover, when $\alpha\in(-l,1-l)$ with any $l\in \mathbb{N}$, one has $l$ negative (strictly increasing) eigenvalues $-\widehat{k}_{\nu+i,1}^2$ with $i\in\{0,\ldots,l-1\}$ where $\widehat{k}_{\nu+l,1}$ denotes the unique zero of $\alpha I_{\nu+l}(k)+lI_{\nu+l}(k)+kI_{\nu+l+1}(k)$; while, for $\alpha=-l$, besides $l$ negative (increasing) eigenvalues, $0$ is also an eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition IV: Toward Ballistic Acceleration for Log-Concave Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acceleration is a celebrated cornerstone of convex optimization, enabling gradient-based algorithms to converge sublinearly in the condition number. A major open question is whether an analogous acceleration phenomenon is possible for log-concave sampling. Underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) has long been conjectured to be the natural candidate for acceleration, but a central challenge is that its degeneracy necessitates the development of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. Although recent breakthroughs established ballistic acceleration for the (continuous-time) ULD diffusion via space-time Poincare inequalities, (discrete-time) algorithmic results remain entirely open: the discretization error of existing analysis techniques dominates any continuous-time acceleration.
  In this paper, we give a new coupling-based local error framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical discretizations in KL divergence. This extends the framework in Shifted Composition III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity. Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD establishes the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number). Along the way, we also obtain the first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total variation error in dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Stability of volume and area preserving mean curvature flow in asymptotic Schwarzschild space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of the volume preserving mean curvature flow (VPMCF) and area preserving mean curvature flow (APMCF) in the Schwarzschild space. We show that if the initial hypersurface is sufficiently close to a coordinate sphere, these flows exist globally and converge smoothly to a constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurface, namely a coordinate sphere. For asymptotically Schwarzschild space, if the initial hypersurface has pinched curvature outside of some large compact set, or more orecisely sufficiently close to an isoperimetric hypersurface, outside of some large compact set in C^2 sense, we will apply similar method combined with the center manifold analysis to see that the flow still exists for all time and converges to CMC hypersurface exponentially fast. This in particular gives an existence result for a CMC hypersurface in asymptotically flat space.</description>
