      <title>Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Instability of G/M/c queues under stochastic resetting in the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper management of resources whose arrival and consumption are subject to environmental randomness is an intrinsic process in both natural and artificial systems. This phenomenon can be modeled as a queuing process whose arrival distribution is determined by a search process with stochastic resetting. When the queuing system has a limited number of servers and the search process occurs within a bounded domain, the dynamics of expediting or delaying the search through stochastic resetting interact with the long-term dynamics of the number of resources in the queue. We combine results from queuing theory with those from search processes with stochastic resetting in a bounded domain to obtain regions of the parameter space of the search process that ensure convergence of the number of resources in the queue to a steady state. Furthermore, we find a threshold resetting rate at which the effects of stochastic resetting shift from reducing convergence regions to expanding them. Finally, we demonstrate that this threshold value grows exponentially with the number of servers, making it harder for stochastic resetting to improve the convergence of the queueing system.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behavior of the finite size Ising model near its critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality classes encompass the analogous thermodynamic behavior of unlike physical systems, at different spatial dimensions $d$, in the vicinity of their critical point. Critical exponents define these classes, with the Ising model being the outstanding prototype that elucidates the differences from the mean-field category, believed to be valid above a critical dimension only. Here, in apparent striking contradiction to the Ising universality class, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of a finite Ising system of $N$ spins in $d = 3$ obeys mean-field Landau theory in the vicinity of its critical point, with classical critical exponents. Yet, when expressed in terms of the linear size $L$ of the system, the free energy unveils its proper finite-size scaling form, from which the thermodynamic limit critical temperature $T_c$ and the Ising critical exponents $\nu$, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ can be identified. We find that the larger the size $L$, the smaller the mean-field region, shrinking to zero in the thermodynamic limit. These conclusions are achieved via the use of an alternative approach to collect data from a Monte Carlo simulation of a three-dimensional Ising model that allows for the evaluation of the free energy per spin $f = f(T,m;L)$ and of the coexistence curve, or spontaneous magnetization at zero magnetic field, $m_{\rm coex} = m(T;L)$ as functions of temperature $T$ and magnetization per spin $m = M/N$. Our results suggest a revision of the role of mean-field theory in the elucidation of critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-Bound Tensor Networks for Exact Ground-State Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Exchange Monte Carlo for continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Exchange Monte Carlo (EMC) method designed for application in continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations at finite temperature. Traditional PIMC methods for bosonic systems suffer from long autocorrelation times, particularly when measuring observables affected by particle permutations, such as the winding number. To address this issue, we introduce an exchange update scheme that facilitates replica transitions between different interaction regimes, significantly accelerating Monte Carlo dynamics-especially for global observables sensitive to permutation effects. Furthermore, we incorporate Stochastic Potential Switching (SPS) to efficiently decompose interactions, substantially enhancing computational efficiency for long-range interatomic pair potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Aziz potentials.</description>

      <title>A Novel Mechanism of Ordering in a Coupled Driven System: Vacancy Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coupled driven system where two different species of particles, along with some vacancies or holes, move on a landscape whose shape fluctuates with time. The movement of the particles is guided by the local shape of the landscape, and this shape is also affected by the presence of different particle species. When a particle species push the landscape in the same (opposite) direction of its own motion, it is called an aligned (a reverse) bias. Aligned bias promotes ordering while reverse bias destroys it. In absence of vacancies, the system reduces to previously studied LH model with different kinds of ordered and disordered phases which could be explained as a competition or cooperation between aligned bias and reverse bias. This interplay is expected to remain unaffected even when vacancies are present since vacancies do not impart any kind of bias on the landscape. However, we find presence of vacancies effectively weakens the reverse bias and this significantly changes the outcome of the competition between the two bias types. As a result novel ordered phases emerge which were not seen before. We analytically calculate the new phase boundaries within mean field approximation. We show even when aligned bias is weaker than reverse bias, it is possible to find long range order in the system. We discover two new phases where particle species showing weak aligned bias phase separate and the other species with strong reverse bias stays mixed with the vacancies. We call these phases finite current with partial phase separation (FPPS) and vacancy induced phase separation (VIPS). The landscape beneath the phase separated species takes the form of a macroscopic hill or valley in FPPS phase. But in VIPS phase it has the shape like a plateau whose height scales as square root of system size. The landscape in the remaining part of the system is disordered in both these phases.</description>

      <title>Information, Dissipation, and Planckian Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $\omega_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.</description>

      <title>Improving 3d Ising OPE Coefficients with Fuzzy Sphere Conformal Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the $K$ special conformal generator in the Fuzzy sphere setup of the Ising CFT to determine primary states. For $\Delta \lesssim 8$, we recover the known primaries and find several new ones, including in the parity-odd sector. We then use these primaries to compute OPE coefficients. We find that using primaries constructed from special-$K$ allows for better extrapolation of OPE coefficients to the CFT limit, because of the existence of an $O(1)$ gap between primaries and descendants in the spectrum of eigenvalues of $|K|^2$ which protects the primaries from strongly mixing with descendants. We compare the CFT data we obtain with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Taming multiparty entanglement at measurement-induced phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.</description>

      <title>Unified criteria for crystallization in hard-core lattice systems with applications to polyomino fluids and chiral mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified extension of two sets of criteria for high-fugacity crystallization in hard-core lattice systems developed previously by Jauslin, Lebowitz, and the author. Our new criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of a volume allocation rule with desirable properties, in analogy to the scoring function constructed in Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture. The proof uses a recent systematic extension of Pirogov--Sinai theory to systems with infinite interactions by Mazel--Stuhl--Suhov. Notably, our result applies to a large class of polyomino models with discrete rotational degrees of freedom and chiral mixtures thereof.</description>

      <title>Suppressed coarsening after an interaction quench in the Holstein chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by an interaction quench in the semiclassical Holstein model within the Ehrenfest nonadiabatic framework, which describes an isolated hybrid quantum-classical system with strictly conserved total energy. Focusing on the half-filled case, where the equilibrium ground state exhibits commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) order for any nonzero coupling, we identify three distinct post-quench dynamical regimes as a function of the final electron-phonon coupling: a nonequilibrium metallic state without CDW order, an intermediate regime characterized by slow scale-invariant ordering dynamics, and a frozen CDW state with arrested coarsening and immobile kinks. We analyze the intermediate regime in detail and uncover an unconventional algebraic decay of the kink density, $n \sim t^{-1/3}$, distinct from both ballistic annihilation and diffusive coarsening in classical dissipative systems. We show that this anomalous exponent arises from the hybrid nature of the dynamics: while the lattice evolves deterministically, the electronic degrees of freedom act as an effective internal bath that induces diffusive kink motion without energy dissipation. An effective reaction-diffusion description, incorporating both annihilation and elastic scattering of kinks, quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behavior. Our results reveal a distinct coarsening mechanism in isolated hybrid systems, demonstrating how internal quantum dynamics can qualitatively reshape defect kinetics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamical morphology of growing bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-equilibrium bacterial colony growth using a geometry-first, time-resolved analysis of morphology. From time-lapse microscopy data, we track the coupled evolution of area, perimeter, and boundary-sensitive shape descriptors along the full growth history. We find that non-equilibrium growth can exhibit extended intervals of compact area--perimeter scaling with exponent $\alpha \approx 2$, consistent with growth governed by a single effective geometric length scale, as well as time-localized breakdowns of this scaling during ongoing growth. These breakdowns coincide with transient boundary reorganization while bulk area growth remains sustained. Our results demonstrate that visually distinct morphologies can arise within the same geometric growth regime, and that departures from single-scale behavior reflect intrinsic dynamical restructuring rather than growth arrest. More broadly, this work establishes time-resolved geometry as a coarse-grained framework for identifying when non-equilibrium growth departs from single-scale geometric constraints in living systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $\tau^{\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $\tau^{\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size. Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-response relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features, such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decomposition of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We decompose the heat dissipation into frequency spectrum using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-response relation (FRR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, and the oscillation asymptotically decays with an envelope inversely proportional to the frequency in the high-frequency region. Furthermore, the oscillation over the low-frequency region reflects the magnitude and sign of the heat dissipation. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times. Since the violation of FRR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.</description>

      <title>How target distributions shape optimal stochastic resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to nonvanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for different monoparametric families of distributions, which sheds light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for optimal search strategies, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.</description>

      <title>Heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of time-delayed dynamics remain largely unexplored, especially for systems that exhibit asymptotically non-stationary behavior. Here, we investigate heat dissipation in two classes of marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin dynamics: (i) diffusive criticality, which asymptotically manifests as scaled Brownian diffusion, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, which shows oscillation with diffusive amplitude. By analytical derivations, we find fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: the average heat dissipation rate asymptotically approaches a constant for diffusive criticality but diverges linearly with oscillations for oscillatory criticality, despite both showing linearly growing variance over time. We discuss in detail how the heat dissipation rate behaves differently as the dynamics asymptotically approaches these two criticality classes from the stable regime. We also numerically study the probability distributions of heat dissipation rates for both types of critical dynamics. Our results demonstrate that non-stationary time-delayed dynamics with similar scaling of variance can yield qualitatively distinct heat dissipation behaviors, depending on the underlying dynamical details. This work provides a concrete foundation for future investigations into thermodynamic properties of general nonlinear time-delayed systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the strength of emergent correlations in a Brownian gas via batch resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ diffusing particles on the line subject to batch resetting: at rate $r$, a uniformly random subset of $m$ particles is reset to the origin. Despite the absence of interactions, the dynamics generates a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range correlations. We obtain exact results, both for the NESS and for the time dependence of the correlations, which are valid for arbitrary $m$ and $N$. By varying $m$, the system interpolates between an uncorrelated regime ($m=1$) and the fully synchronous resetting case ($m=N$). For all $1&lt;m&lt;N$, correlations exhibit a non-monotonic time dependence due to the emergence of an intrinsic decorrelation mechanism. In the stationary state, the correlation strength can be tuned by varying $m$, and it displays a transition at a critical value $N_c=6$. Our predictions extend straightforwardly to any spatial dimension $d$ and the critical value $N_c=6$ remains the same in all dimensions. Our predictions are testable in existing experimental setups on optically trapped colloidal particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While non-reciprocal couplings are ubiquitous in classical systems, their impact on quantum many-body criticality and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Using exact numerical simulations, we study an interacting fermionic chain subject to non-reciprocal gain and loss. We show that the interplay between dissipation and interactions drives a dissipative phase transition, marked by the opening of a many-body gap and a crossover from power-law to exponential relaxation. The weakly-interacting regime displays non-reciprocal signatures, including nonzero currents and directional charge accumulation reminiscent of the skin effect. Notably, despite this localization, quantum trajectories exhibit volume-law entanglement. Finally, reciprocity is dynamically restored above a critical interaction strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>
