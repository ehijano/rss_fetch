      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Finally, we show that our approach facilitates MLIPs' training in a setting where the computation of forces is infeasible at the reference level, such as those employing complete-basis-set extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Thermodynamic Group-Contribution Methods by Machine Learning: UNIFAC 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties is pivotal in chemical engineering for optimizing process efficiency and sustainability. Physical group-contribution (GC) methods are widely employed for this purpose but suffer from historically grown, incomplete parameterizations, limiting their applicability and accuracy. In this work, we overcome these limitations by combining GC with matrix completion methods (MCM) from machine learning. We use the novel approach to predict a complete set of pair-interaction parameters for the most successful GC method: UNIFAC, the workhorse for predicting activity coefficients in liquid mixtures. The resulting new method, UNIFAC 2.0, is trained and validated on more than 224,000 experimental data points, showcasing significantly enhanced prediction accuracy (e.g., nearly halving the mean squared error) and increased scope by eliminating gaps in the original model's parameter table. Moreover, the generic nature of the approach facilitates updating the method with new data or tailoring it to specific applications.</description>

      <title>Can We Learn the Energy of Sublimation of Ice from Water Clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short paper reports a study of the electronic dissociation energies, De, of water clusters from direct ab initio (mostly CCSD(T)) calculations and the q-AQUA and MB-pol potentials. These clusters range in size from 6-25 monomers. These are all in very good agreement with each other, as shown in a recent Perspective by Herman and Xantheas. To the best of our knowledge, we present for the first time results for the De per monomer. To our surprise this quantity appears to be converging to a value close to 12 kcal/mol. An estimate of 1.5 - 2 kcal/mol for the {\Delta}ZPE for these clusters puts the value of D0 at 10 to 10.5 kcal/mol. This value is remarkably (and probably fortuitously) close to the reported sublimation enthalpy of 10.2 kcal/mol at 10 K. However, given that these De energies correspond to dissociation of the cluster to N isolated monomers the interpretation of ``vaporization" of these ``solid" clusters is qualitatively reasonable.</description>

      <title>FragPT2: Multi-Fragment Wavefunction Embedding with Perturbative Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding techniques allow the efficient description of correlations within localized fragments of large molecular systems, while accounting for their environment at a lower level of theory. We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding framework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are assigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular orbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method, self-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally, inter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference perturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of inter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative importance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin exchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \ce{N_2} dimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method can be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Using Linearized Pair-Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is an effective method for modeling nonradiative decay in electronically excited molecules. Its accuracy depends strongly on the quality of the potential energy surfaces, and its affordability for long direct-dynamic simulations with adequate ensemble averaging depends strongly on the cost of the required electronic structure calculations. Linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed post-self-consistent field multireference method that can model potential energy surfaces with an accuracy similar to expensive multireference perturbation theories but at a computational cost similar to the underlying multiconfiguration self-consistent field method. Here we integrate the SHARC dynamics and PySCF electronic structure code to utilize L-PDFT for electronically nonadiabatic calculations and use the combined programs to study the photoisomerization reaction of cis-azomethane. We show that L-PDFT is able to successfully simulate the photoisomerization and yields results similar to the more expensive extended multi-state complete active space second-order perturbation theory. This shows that L-PDFT can model internal conversion, and it demonstrates its promise for broader photodynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of CO2 Conversion to SAF in a Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon refers to an indirect pathway of CO2 utilization. Among them, the conversion of CO2 with green H2 to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with high energy density has gained much attention. It offers a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the fossil fuel crises, and transform a climate killer into valuable products. However, this low-carbon technology is intrinsically complicated. It involves the development of a catalyst, the design of a reaction system, and its operation and product refining. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical process of CO2 hydrogenation in the reactor. In this study, numerical simulations of a fixed bed catalytic reactor for CO2-to-SAF conversion are conducted by coupling CFD with heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the catalytic surface. The heat and mass transfer between the catalyst surface and surrounding fluid flow are resolved in the simulation. A detailed understanding of the reacting flow and catalytic processes is obtained from this study. The impact of operating parameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, and the ratio between CO2 and H2, is also explored, which provides important insights into the catalytic reactor design and operation.</description>

      <title>Constructing accurate and efficient general-purpose atomistic machine learning model with transferable accuracy for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been a cornerstone in computational science, providing powerful insights into structure-property relationships for molecules and materials through first-principles quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations. However, the advent of atomistic machine learning (ML) is reshaping the landscape by enabling large-scale dynamics simulations and high-throughput screening at DFT-equivalent accuracy with drastically reduced computational cost. Yet, the development of general-purpose atomistic ML models as surrogates for QM calculations faces several challenges, particularly in terms of model capacity, data efficiency, and transferability across chemically diverse systems. This work introduces a novel extension of the polarizable atom interaction neural network (namely, XPaiNN) to address these challenges. Two distinct training strategies have been employed, one direct-learning and the other $\Delta$-ML on top of a semi-empirical QM method. These methodologies have been implemented within the same framework, allowing for a detailed comparison of their results. The XPaiNN models, in particular the one using $\Delta$-ML, not only demonstrate competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but also demonstrate the effectiveness against other ML models and QM methods on comprehensive downstream tasks, including non-covalent interactions, reaction energetics, barrier heights, geometry optimization and reaction thermodynamics, etc. This work represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of accurate and efficient atomistic ML models of general-purpose, capable of handling complex chemical systems with transferable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Kohn-Sham potential for molecular dissociation with orbital-independent functionals: a proof of principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing for Chemical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in quantum computing has increased due to technological advances in quantum hardware and algorithms. Despite the promises of quantum advantage, the applicability of quantum devices has been limited to few qubits on hardware that experiences decoherence due to noise. One proposed method to get around this challenge is distributed quantum computing (DQC). Like classical distributed computing, DQC aims at increasing compute power by spreading the compute processes across many devices, with the goal to minimize the noise and circuit depth required by quantum devices. In this paper, we cover the fundamental concepts of DQC and provide insight into where the field of DQC stands with respect to the field of chemistry -- a field which can potentially be used to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The objective of the LES simulation is to investigate how operational parameters affect flame properties in combustion of the premixed NH3/H2/air inside a swirling burner. Key parameters explored include the differential blend ratio of NH3/H2 fuels, ignition conditions, flow dynamics, and the balance between accuracy and computational cost using reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms. The numerical simulation findings suggest optimal operational conditions for enhancing thermal efficiency and controlling NOx emissions for experimental setups, scaling up combustion platforms.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and phase transition of decagonal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleation of quasicrystals from liquid or periodic crystals by developing an efficient order-order phase transition algorithm, namely the nullspace-preserving saddle search method. Specifically, we focus on nucleation and phase transitions of the decagonal quasicrystal (DQC) based on the Lifshitz-Petrich model. We present the nucleation path of DQC from the liquid and demonstrate one- and two-stage transition paths between DQC and periodic crystals. We provide a perspective of the group-subgroup phase transition and nucleation rates to understand the nucleation and phase transition mechanisms involving DQC. These results reveal the one-step and stepwise modes of symmetry breaking or recovery in the phase transition from DQC, where the stepwise modes are more probable.</description>

      <title>Anaysis of the validity of P2D models for solid-state batteries in a large parameter range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation models are nowadays indispensable to efficiently assess or optimize novel battery cell concepts during the development process. Electro-chemo-mechano models are widely used to investigate solid-state batteries during cycling and allow the prediction of the dependence of design parameters like material properties, geometric properties, or operating conditions on output quantities like the state of charge. One possibility of classification of these physics-based models is their level of geometric resolution, including three-dimensionally resolved models and geometrically homogenized models, known as Doyle-Fuller-Newman or pseudo two-dimensional models. Within this study, the advantages and drawbacks of these two types of models are identified within a wide range of the design parameter values. Therefore, the sensitivity of an output quantity of the models on one or a combination of parameters is compared. In particular, the global sensitivity, i.e., the sensitivity in a wide range of parameter values, is computed by using the Sobol indices as a measure. Furthermore, the local sensitivity of the difference in the output quantities of both models is evaluated to identify regions of parameter values in which they contain significant deviations. Finally, remarks on the potential interplay between both models to obtain fast and reliable results are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability that a configuration of a physical system reacts, or transitions from one metastable state to another, is quantified by the committor function. This function contains richly detailed mechanistic information about transition pathways, but a full parameterization of the committor requires building representing a high-dimensional function, a generically challenging task. Recent efforts to leverage neural networks as a means to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations, often called "physics-informed" machine learning, have brought the committor into computational reach. Here, we build on the semigroup approach to learning the committor and assess its utility for predicting dynamical quantities such as transition rates. We show that a careful reframing of the objective function and improved adaptive sampling strategies provide highly accurate representations of the committor. Furthermore, by directly applying the Hill relation, we show that these committors provide accurate transition rates for molecular system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report evaluates the applicability of the ideal gas law in the pressurized air-bearing of hard disk drives when calculating the relative humidity. We employ a semi-analytical numerical method that solves vapor-liquid equilibrium using the Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the saturation pressure of water. The deviation from the ideal gas law is quantified and examined through saturation pressure isotherms. We find that at low temperatures, lighter gases such as helium show little deviation from the ideal gas law, whereas heavier gases such as nitrogen deviate significantly. As temperature increases, the difference between the gases decreases. The results suggest that in areas of low temperature, the non-ideal nature of gases must be taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery that linearly polarized light with a helical wavefront can exhibit vortex dichroism (also referred to as helical dichroism) has opened up new horizons in chiroptical spectroscopy with structured chiral light. Recent experiments have now pushed optical activity with vortex beams into the regime of nonlinear optics. Here we present the theory of two-photon absorption (TPA) of focused optical vortices by chiral molecules: nonlinear vortex dichroism (NVD). We discover that highly distinct features arise in the case of TPA with focused vortex beams, including the ability to probe chiral molecular structure not accessible to current methods and that the differential rate of TPA is significantly influenced by the orientation of the state of linear polarization. This work provides strong evidence that combining nonlinear optical activity with structured light provides new and improved routes to studying molecular chirality.</description>

      <title>SOFI: Finding point group symmetries in atomic clusters as finding the set of degenerate solutions in a shape-matching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06131v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point Group (PG) symmetries play a fundamental role in many aspects of theoretical chemistry and computational materials science. With the objective to automatize the search of PG symmetry operations of generic atomic clusters, we present a new algorithm called Symmetry Operation FInder (SOFI). SOFI addresses the problem of identifying PG symmetry by framing it as a degenerate shape-matching problem, where the multiple solutions correspond to distinct symmetry operations. The developed algorithm is compared against three other algorithms dedicated to PG identification, on a large set of atomic clusters. The results, along with some illustrative use cases, showcase the effectiveness of SOFI. The SOFI algorithm is released as part of the IRA library, accessible at https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we generate and maintain a database of 10 million virtual lipids through METiS's in-house de novo lipid generation algorithms and lipid virtual screening techniques. These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for pre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge transfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance. We propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language Model (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like lipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic manipulation of sub-500 Da biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of nanoscale matter has the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields across nanoscience and technology. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and characterize numerically a device that combines the benefits of dielectrophoresis (DEP) - long-range and strong trapping forces - with those of plasmonic tweezers - high sensitivities - to achieve a remarkable efficiency in the trapping and sensing of metallic nanoparticles and biomolecules. In particular, we show the DEP trapping and surface enhanced Raman scattering characterization of bovine serum albumin and Rhodamine B, thus extending the applications of tweezing devices to molecules having masses of only a few hundreds of Da. This range covers virtually any molecule relevant for life, from tiny oligopeptides to large proteins. This pushes our manipulation capabilities deep into the realms of efficient single-molecule biosensing and quantum science, providing a powerful platform to probe matter at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Contextual Subspace Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Improved bias with reduced quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Towards the "puzzle" of Chromium dimer Cr$_2$: predicting the Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>

      <title>Active Learning in Symbolic Regression with Physical Constraints</title>

Abstract: Evolutionary symbolic regression (SR) fits a symbolic equation to data, which gives a concise interpretable model. We explore using SR as a method to propose which data to gather in an active learning setting with physical constraints. SR with active learning proposes which experiments to do next. Active learning is done with query by committee, where the Pareto frontier of equations is the committee. The physical constraints improve proposed equations in very low data settings. These approaches reduce the data required for SR and achieves state of the art results in data required to rediscover known equations.</description>

      <title>Exact equilibrium properties of square-well and square-shoulder disks in single-file confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the (longitudinal) thermodynamic and structural characteristics of single-file confined square-well and square-shoulder disks by employing a mapping technique that transforms the original system into a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive rods. Leveraging standard statistical-mechanical techniques, exact results are derived for key properties, including the equation of state, internal energy, radial distribution function, and structure factor. The asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function is explored, revealing structural changes in the spatial correlations. Additionally, exact analytical expressions for the second virial coefficient are presented. The theoretical results for the thermodynamic and structural properties are validated by our Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. Employing an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials, we compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system. The results are corroborated by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment on Metal Surfaces: The Case of HCl$^-$ on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of charges, including electrons and holes, is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis, taking part in the reduction and oxidation of adsorbate species on catalyst surfaces. In plasmonic catalysis, electrons can transfer from photo-excited metal nanoparticles to molecular adsorbates, forming transient negative ions that can easily undergo reactions such as dissociation, desorption, or other chemical transformations. However, ab initio characterization of these anionic states has proven challenging, and little is known about the topology of their potential energy surfaces. In this work, we investigate the dissociative adsorption of HCl on Au(111) as a representative catalytic process with relatively low reaction probabilities, which could potentially be enhanced by electron transfer from photo-excited gold nanoparticles to HCl. We employ projection-based density embedding that combines the equation-of-motion electron-attachment coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-EA-CCSD) method with density functional theory (DFT), and build dissociation curves of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) along the H-Cl bond distance. The HCl anion in the gas phase is unbound at equilibrium distances and only becomes bound as the bond stretches. However, our results show that, upon adsorption on Au(111), HCl$^-$ remains a stable, bound anion at all bond lengths due to charge delocalization to the metal. Forming bound anions is easier, and dissociation of HCl$^-$ on Au(111) is further facilitated, with its dissociation energy reduced by 0.61 eV compared to its neutral counterpart on Au(111), and by 1.16 eV relative to HCl. These results underscore the efficacy of embedded EOM-CCSD methods in addressing surface science challenges and highlight the potential of plasmonic catalysis proceeding via bound, rather than transient, anionic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization with any Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, practical applications require algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly represented the Hamiltonian of the system in second quantization. Existing methods in first quantization are limited to grid-based approaches that do not allow for active space calculations. In this work, we present a method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization on a fault-tolerant quantum computer using any basis set. This allows for calculations in the active space using modern quantum chemistry basis sets. We derive a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition for a chemical Hamiltonian in first quantization and then construct an efficient block encoding, exploiting sparsity of the Hamiltonian. For active space calculations using a molecular orbital basis set, we achieve an asymptotic speed up in Toffoli-gate count compared to the equivalent method in second quantization [Berry, et. al. Quantum 3, 208 (2019)]. We also consider the dual plane waves for materials simulations and find that in physically interesting regimes we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in quantum resources compared to the second quantization counterpart. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to the first quantization plane wave algorithm of Refs.[Babbush, et. al npj Quantum Inf 5(1) 92 (2019), Su et. al PRX Quantum 2(4), 040332 (2021)] that, unlike our approach, avoids loading the classical data from quantum memory. This work opens up possibilities to reduce quantum resources even further using factorization methods of a Hamiltonian or modern pseudopotentials. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to other applications, such as the vibrational properties of chemical systems.</description>
