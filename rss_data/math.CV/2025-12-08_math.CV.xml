      <title>Invariant polynomials, gaps, and sparseness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider each of the three classes of representations of cyclic groups that arise in the study of rational sphere maps. We study the possible number of terms for invariant polynomials with non-negative coefficients that are constant on the appropriate line or hyperplane. Our result provides crucial information about gaps in the possible target dimensions for certain invariant polynomial sphere maps. We interpret our results in terms of sparseness for solutions of certain linear systems.</description>

      <title>More counterexamples to the Arithmetic Puncturing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct examples of threefolds with terminal singularities (resp. surfaces with canonical singularities) which are special in the sense of Campana, have a potentially dense set of integral points, admit a dense entire curve, have vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric, and are geometrically special in the sense of Javanpeykar-Rousseau but whose regular locus fails to have any of these properties. This improves on earlier work by Cadorel-Campana-Rousseau and joint work by the author with Javanpeykar-Levin, where such fourfolds with canonical singularities were constructed, and gives refined answers to questions due to Hassett-Tschinkel and Kamenova-Lehn. Lastly, we show that some of our examples satisfy the weak approximation property and briefly discuss a question on puncturing varieties satisfying strong approximation raised by Wittenberg.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative operators on analytic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H. J. Schwartz proved in his thesis (1969) that a nonzero bounded operator on Hardy spaces $(H^p, 1\leq p\leq\infty)$ is almost multiplicative if and only if it is a composition operator. But, his proof has a gap. In this article, we show that his result is not correct for $H^\infty$ and we fill the gap for $H^p, 1\leq p&lt;\infty.$ Further, we prove that on several classical spaces such as the Bloch space, the little Bloch space, Besov spaces $B_p$ for $p&gt;1$, and weighted Bergman spaces an operator is almost multiplicative if and only if it is a composition operator. Finally, we give a complete characterization of those composition operators that are multiplicative with respect to the Duhamel product of analytic functions.</description>

      <title>Montel's theorem and composition operators for analytic almost periodic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Banach space $H^\infty_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ of bounded analytic functions on the open right half-plane $\mathbb{C}_0$ that are almost periodic on some smaller half-plane, as well as the subspace $A_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ of those functions in $H^\infty_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ that are uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{C}_0$. We prove a strong version of Montel's theorem for $H^\infty_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ and characterize the bounded composition operators on $H^\infty_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ and $A_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$, as well as the compact composition operators on $H^\infty_{\mathrm{ap}}(\mathbb{C}_0)$ and certain subspaces of it.</description>

      <title>Higher-order diffusion and Cahn-Hilliard-type models revisited on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve explicitly and analyze rigorously inhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems (IBVP) for several fourth-order variations of the traditional diffusion equation and the associated linearized Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) model (also Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), formulated in the spatiotemporal quarter-plane. Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too.</description>

      <title>Sharp Schoenberg type inequalities and the de Bruin--Sharma problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we confirm two conjectures proposed by Georgiev, G\'{o}mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner~\cite{GGTW25} on Schoenberg type inequalities of order $4$, thereby providing a complete solution to the de Bruin--Sharma problem. We further develop a new interpolation framework to study Schoenberg type inequalities and, in particular, give a new proof of Pereira's result. Motivated by Sendov's conjecture, we then derive sharp Schoenberg type inequalities of orders $-1$ and $-2m$ (with $m \in \mathbb{N}$), as well as non-sharp inequalities valid for all negative orders $p \le -1$. Finally, we discuss a dual counterpart of the Schoenberg type inequalities of order $-2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a twisted version of the Kawamata semi-positivity theorem by the $\mathbb{Q}$-line bundle with a vanishing Lelong number at every point. Moreover, we apply the result to the finite generation problem for canonical rings of Birkar's generalized pairs.</description>

      <title>The Conjugate Function Method for Surfaces with Elaborate Topological Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains on surfaces. In this paper the conjugate function method, earlier used for simply connected domains, is generalized and refined to achieve the same level of accuracy on multiply connected planar domains and Riemann surfaces. The main challenge is the accurate and efficient construction of boundary values for the conjugate problem on multiply connected domains. The method relies on high-order finite element methods which allow for highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry containing strong singularities and cusps. We also derive the reciprocal error estimate for the multiply connected case. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments with error estimates.</description>
