      <title>What's the Buzz About GX 13+1? Constraining Coronal Geometry with QUEEN-BEE: A Bayesian Nested Sampling Framework for X-ray Polarization Rotation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotation in several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, including the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1. We developed a novel Bayesian nested sampling framework-"Q-U Event-by-Event Nested sampling for Bayesian EVPA Evolution" (QUEEN-BEE)-to model unbinned Stokes parameters and infer optimal EVPA rotation rates in IXPE data. We then applied this framework to three previous IXPE observations of GX 13+1. In the first observation, QUEEN-BEE recovers a rotation rate of 42+/-4 degrees/day, consistent with prior binned analysis. Energy-binned QUEEN-BEE analysis of this first observation suggests a slab-like coronal geometry, providing the first constraints between slab and shell coronae for this source. We also explore alternative EVPA rotation scenarios in GX 13+1 including variable disk wind behavior. The second observation of this source shows no evidence of rotation, and the third observation shows transient rotating behavior with an EVPA rotation rate when exiting a light curve dip of 170 +20/-40 degrees/day. The results show marginal but consistent increases in the overall measured polarization degree (PD) for epochs where the EVPA rotation is identified. These results demonstrate that QUEEN-BEE can identify evolving polarization signatures in both time- and energy-resolved regimes, even where binned methods fall below detection thresholds. Our findings highlight the diagnostic potential of QUEEN-BEE as a tool for discriminating between competing physical models of coronal geometry and probing disk-wind-related polarization behavior, highlighting the promising potential for application of this framework in a variety of other IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Jipole}$: A Differentiable $\texttt{ipole}$-based Code for Radiative Transfer in Curved Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.</description>

      <title>The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</description>

      <title>Subgrid modelling of MRI-driven turbulence in differentially rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the transient remnant is often a fast-spinning, differentially rotating, magnetised hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). This object is prone to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) which drives magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that significantly influences the HMNS global dynamics. A key consequence of turbulence is the outward transport of angular momentum which impacts the remnant's stability and lifetime. Most numerical simulations of BNS mergers are unable to resolve the MRI due to its inherently small wavelength. To overcome this limitation, subgrid models have been proposed to capture the effects of unresolved small-scale physics in terms of large-scale quantities. We present the first implementation of our MHD-Instability-Induced Turbulence (MInIT) model in global Newtonian simulations of MRI-sensitive, differentially rotating, magnetised neutron stars. Here, we show that by adding the corresponding turbulent stress tensors to the momentum equation, MInIT successfully reproduces the angular momentum transport in neutron stars driven by small-scale turbulence.</description>

      <title>The redshift distribution of Einstein Probe transients supports their relation to gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the \textit{Einstein Probe} unleashed a new era of high-energy transient discovery in the largely unexplored soft X-ray band. The \textit{Einstein Probe} has detected a significant number of fast X-ray transients that display no gamma-ray emission, complicating their robust association to more common gamma-ray bursts. To explore their possible connection, we analyzed the redshift distribution of both \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients and long duration gamma-ray bursts. A comparative analysis of their cumulative redshift distributions using non-parametric two-sample tests, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, finds no statistically significant difference. These tests favor that their redshifts are drawn from the same underlying distribution. This empirical connection between \textit{Einstein Probe} transients and long gamma-ray bursts is further supported by their agreement with the so-called ``Amati relation'' between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic-equivalent energy. Together, these results indicate that most extragalactic \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients are closely related to long gamma-ray bursts and originate from a massive star (collapsar) progenitor channel. Our findings highlight the role of the \textit{Einstein Probe} in uncovering the missing population of failed jets and dirty fireballs that emit primarily at soft X-ray wavelengths.</description>

      <title>When (not) to trust Monte Carlo approximations for hierarchical Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coming years of gravitational wave astrophysics promises thousands of new detections, which can unlock fundamental scientific insights if the information in each observation can be properly synthesized into a coherent picture. State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\hat{E} \lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \texttt{pip}-installable package \texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\hat{E}$.</description>

      <title>First look at Vela X-1 with XRISM: A simultaneous campaign with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Setting Limits on Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter with Xenon-based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Hadronic Diffuse $\gamma$-Ray Emission from the Temporal Stochasticity of Cosmic-Ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is a key probe of cosmic rays (CRs) distribution within the Galaxy. However, the discrepancies between observations and theoretical model expectations highlight the need for refined uncertainty estimates. In the literature, spatial and temporal variability of lepton flux has been discussed as an uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimation. In the present work, we demonstrate that variability in the high energy CR hadron flux is an important, yet previously underappreciated, source of uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimates. To assess this effect, we perform fully three-dimensional, time-dependent GALPROP simulations of CR protons injected from discrete Galactic sources. Our results reveal that the uncertainty in the hadronic component of diffuse $\gamma$ rays is non-negligible and can be comparable to, or even exceed, current experimental uncertainties at very high energies. This finding challenges the conventional assumption that only leptonic fluctuations are relevant to diffuse $\gamma$-ray modeling.</description>

      <title>TeV Emission in NGC 4278: Shock Energetics Insufficient, Compact Origin Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory recently detected TeV emission from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4278. Integral-field spectroscopy with MEGARA revealed ionized outflows on hundred-parsec scales with kinetic power $\dot E_{\rm shock} \sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, well below the TeV luminosity $L_{\gamma} \gtrsim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The implied efficiencies, $\eta \gtrsim 1000$, are far above unity, showing that shocks cannot account for the TeV emission. Contemporaneous Fermi-Large Area Telescope and Swift data, consistent with a compact synchrotron self-Compton jet component, favor a nuclear origin. NGC 4278 is the first low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)/LLAGN of its class detected at TeV energies, a benchmark for LINERs with outflows and a prime target for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. I conclude that the TeV photons arise from a compact nuclear accelerator, while optical outflows trace larger-scale jet--ISM interactions that coexist but do not power the TeV radiation.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei: on orbital inclination and Schwarzschild apsidal precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations.

      <title>Investigating Temporal Features in Swift GRB Afterglows: A Comparative Study of UVOT and XRT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a statistical analysis of optical light curves (LCs) of 200 UVOT-detected GRBs from 2005 to 2018. We have categorised these LCs based on their distinct morphological features, including early flares, bumps, breaks, plateaus, etc. Additionally, to compare features across different wavelengths, we have also included XRT LCs in our sample. The early observation capability of UVOT has allowed us to identify very early flares in 21 GRBs preceding the normal decay or bump, consistent with predictions of external reverse or internal shock. The decay indices of optical LCs following a simple power-law (PL) are shallower than corresponding X-ray LCs, indicative of a spectral break between two wavelengths. Not all LCs with PL decay align with the forward shock model and require additional components such as energy injection or a structured jet. Further, plateaus in the optical LCs are primarily consistent with energy injection from the central engine to the external medium. However, in four cases, plateaus followed by steep decay may have an internal origin. The optical luminosity observed during the plateau is tightly correlated with the break time, indicative of a magnetar as their possible central engine. For LCs with early bumps, the peak position, correlations between the parameters, and observed achromaticity allowed us to constrain their origin as the onset of afterglow, off-axis jet, late re-brightening, etc. In conclusion, the ensemble of observed features is explained through diverse physical mechanisms or emissions observed from different outflow locations and, in turn, diversity among possible progenitors.</description>

      <title>The time-domain gamma-ray sky seen by the Fermi-LAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is currently celebrating its 15th anniversary of operation. Since its launch, the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), the main instrument onboard the Fermi satellite, has remarkably unveiled the sky at GeV energies providing outstanding results in time-domain gamma-ray astrophysics. In particular, LAT has observed some of the most powerful transient phenomena in the Universe (such as gamma-ray bursts, blazar flares, magnetar flares, ...) enabling the possibility to test our current understanding of the laws of physics in extreme conditions. In this paper I will review some of the main recent results with a focus on the transient phenomena seen by LAT with a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger connection.</description>

      <title>Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).</description>

      <title>Early warning for lensed gravitational wave counterparts from time delays of their host galaxies observed in the optical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to provide early-warning times of $\mathcal{O}({\rm hours})$ to $\mathcal{O}({\rm days})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black Holes (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to capture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess the practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images of the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH signals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses with image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for typical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and quads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find that time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC mocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions (typical relative error $\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a difference in time-delay estimates of $\mathcal{O}(\rm days)$ between the predictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly advocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies to feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning.</description>

      <title>Advanced Weights for IXPE Polarization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) measures increasingly faint sources, the need for precise polarimetry extraction becomes paramount. In addition to previously described neural-net (NN) weights, we introduce here point-spread function weights and particle background weights, which can be critical for faint sources. In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase and energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to incorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test it on archival IXPE observations. Together these weights decrease the area of the polarization uncertainty contour by a factor of two and will be essential for background-limited IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter Models from Supermassive Black Hole Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses $&lt; 2.0\times 10^{-20}$ eV and WDM particles with masses $&lt; 7.2$ keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion and dark photon production in magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using magnetic white dwarfs as a case study, we show that the emission of sub-MeV bosons from stellar plasmas can be substantially modified in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, the magnetic field-induced anisotropy and cyclotron resonance both significantly affect the in-medium dispersion relations of the Standard Model photon. As a result, resonant level crossing between photons and other light bosons occurs under environmental conditions that differ from the resonance criteria in unmagnetized environments. We find that the magnetic field opens additional regions within magnetic white dwarfs where resonance can occur. These findings motivate revisiting astrophysical constraints on light bosons in systems where the cyclotron frequency is comparable to or larger than the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (&lt; au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH): a spectrometer for the GRIPS-2 balloon campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon. IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.
  The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Discovering Cataclysmic Variables from the Rubin Observatory LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a windfall of new transients and variable sources. Here we have performed mock observation simulations to understand LSST's expected detection rates for cataclysmic variables (CVs) with known large amplitude variations. Under the thin-disk approximation for the distribution of CVs in our Galaxy, we found that only 20% of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae systems, representing the most energetic disk-driven outbursts in CVs, will be detected during outbursts by the LSST. Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than $17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence counterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST towards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected twice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in different bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to 4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections over 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the detection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated sample will be observed as a &gt;= 0.4 mag-amplitude and &lt;= 1-d duration spike in the long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability to studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and organize follow-up observation strategies on transients discovered by LSST.</description>

      <title>GW230814: investigation of a loud gravitational-wave signal observed with a single detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW230814 was detected by the LIGO Livingston observatory with a signal-to-noise ratio of 42.4 making it the loudest gravitational-wave signal in the GWTC-4.0 catalog. The source is consistent with a binary black hole coalescence similar to those in the previously observed population, with component masses $m_1 = 33.7^{+2.9}_{-2.2}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $m_2 = 28.2^{+2.2}_{-3.1} M_\odot$, and small effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}= -0.01^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. The high signal-to-noise ratio enabled us to confidently detect an $\ell = |m| = 4$ mode in the inspiral signal for the first time, and enables a range of tests of consistency between theoretical predictions and the observed waveform. Most of these tests show good agreement with expectations from general relativity. However, a few indicate deviations, particularly in the ringdown part of the signal. We find that deviations comparable to those observed can be obtained from similar simulated signals based on general relativity and detector noise effects. Therefore, the apparent deviations do not provide evidence for a violation of general relativity. The observation of GW230814 demonstrates that while the unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors enable highly significant detections with a single observatory, drawing robust inferences about fundamental physics remains limited without data from a multiple observatory network.</description>

      <title>Directed searches for gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around merger remnant and galactic black holes during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Indirect dark matter searches with neutrino telescopes via energetic cosmic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the high energy neutrino flux observed by terrestrial telescopes originates from dark matter (DM) annihilation. Specifically, we study a minimal, UV-complete $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac DM candidate, whose annihilation into neutrinos proceeds exclusively through a $Z^\prime$ boson. By computing the annihilation cross section and comparing with the observed flux, we derive bounds on the model parameters. Additional constraints are obtained within the freeze-in framework, where the observed relic abundance is reproduced, leading to the strongest bounds. Considering cosmic string vibrations as a source of gravitational waves, we further constrain the vacuum expectation value of the $U(1)$ breaking. All results are contrasted with perturbativity limits and existing constraints from low- and high-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning empowered search for Sub-Minute Optical Transient Events with the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical transient surveys continue to generate increasingly large datasets, prompting the introduction of machine-learning algorithms to search for quality transient candidates efficiently. Existing machine-learning infrastructure can be leveraged in novel ways to search these datasets for new classes of transients. We present a machine-learning accelerated search pipeline for the Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme designed to identify high-quality astrophysical transient candidates that contain a single detection. Given the rapid observing cadence of the DWF programme, these single-detection transient candidates have durations on sub-minute timescales. This work marks the first time optical transients have been systematically explored on these timescales, to a depth of m$\sim$23. We report the discovery of two high-quality sub-minute transient candidates from a pilot study of 671,761 light curves and investigate their potential origins with multiwavelength data. We discuss, in detail, possible non-astrophysical false positives, confidently reject electronic artefacts and asteroids, ruling out glints from satellites below 800 km and strongly disfavouring those at higher altitudes. We calculate a rate on the sky of $4.72^{+6.39}_{-3.28}\times10^5$ per day for these sub-minute transient candidates.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strength computations: the sample case of Sr II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07684v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017 (GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the significantly improved sensitivity and a wider frequency band, the next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are anticipated to detect $\sim 10^5$ GW signals per year with durations from hours to days, leading to inevitable signal overlaps in the data stream. While a direct fitting for all signals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of biases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus on the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination angles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity, named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example, we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in a detector network.</description>

      <title>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>

      <title>Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Though the Bayesian factor slightly prefers the standard BBHs merger model, it is not significant enough to rule out the possibility that the echo-for-wormhole model is a viable hypothesis for the GW190521 event.</description>

      <title>Oscillation-Independent Probes of Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first oscillation-independent astrophysical method to probe non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in core-collapse supernovae. Using a self-consistent treatment of NSI effects in both supernova neutrino emission simulations and flavor independent neutral-current scattering in detectors, we show that anti-correlated coincidence signatures between liquid scintillator experiments such as JUNO and dark matter detectors such as DARWIN/XLZD, ARGO, or RES-NOVA break degeneracy between NSI and flavor conversions effects. For a Galactic supernova within $\lesssim1$ kpc this approach enables independent probes of neutrino-quark NSI couplings in parameter space overlapping and extending beyond existing terrestrial limits. Our results establish a novel oscillation-independent avenue to test fundamental neutrino interactions in extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the X-ray polarisation of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 after the soft-to-hard spectral transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the detection of X-ray polarisation in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its dim hard spectral state by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). This is the first detection of X-ray polarisation at the transition from the soft to the hard state in an X-ray binary. We find an averaged 2$-$8 keV polarisation degree of (3.3 ${\pm}$ 0.4) % and a corresponding polarisation angle of 3{\deg} ${\pm}$ 4{\deg}, which matches the polarisation detected during the rising stage of the outburst, in September$-$October 2023, within 1${\sigma}$ uncertainty. The observational campaign complements previous studies of this source and enables comparison of the X-ray polarisation properties of a single transient across the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram. The complete recovery of the X-ray polarisation properties, including the energy dependence, came after a dramatic drop in the X-ray polarisation during the soft state. The new IXPE observations in the dim hard state at the reverse transition indicate that the accretion properties, including the geometry of the corona, appear to be strikingly similar to the bright hard state during the outburst rise despite the X-ray luminosities differing by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>One Year of SN 2023ixf: Breaking Through the Degenerate Parameter Space in Light-Curve Models with Pulsating Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of $\texttt{MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\rm exp}\approx7\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\gtrsim 16.5\ M_{\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\lesssim 3\ M_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\gtrsim 950\ R_{\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $\approx0.068\ M_{\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency Probes of the Persistent Radio Sources associated with Repeating FRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of Persistent Radio Sources (PRSs) associated with three repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has provided insight into the local environments of these FRBs. Here, we present deep radio observations of the fields surrounding three highly active repeating FRBs namely, FRB 20220912A, FRB 20240114A, and FRB 20240619D using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at low radio frequencies. Towards FRB~20240114A, we report the detection of compact source at 650\,MHz with a flux density of 65.6$\pm$8.1\,$\mu$Jy/beam. Our measurements of the spectral index, star formation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the physical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio source (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect radio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy. For FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an associated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with FRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only three other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form of magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Structure and Skewness of the Effective Inspiral Spin Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well-measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$ -- a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary's orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least $12 \% - 17\%$ (at $90\%$ credibility). Our models do not find an excess of non-spinning systems and instead find that at least $\sim 20 \%$ of the binaries have some degree of negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$. The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.</description>

Abstract: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 9$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>

Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>SN 2023xgo: Helium-rich Type Icn or Carbon-Flash Type Ibn supernova?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of SN~2023xgo, a transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova, from $-5.6$ to $+63$~days relative to the $r$-band peak. Early spectra show C~III $\lambda 5696$ emission reminiscent of Type~Icn SNe, which later gives way to Type~Ibn features. The He~I velocities ($1800$--$10{,}000$~km~s$^{-1}$) and pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The light curve declines at $0.14$~mag~d$^{-1}$ until $+30$~days, consistent with SNe~Ibn/Icn and slower than fast transients. SN~2023xgo is the faintest in our SN~Ibn sample ($M_r=-17.65\pm0.04$) but shows typical color and host properties. Semi-analytical modeling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM shell ($\sim 10^{12}$--$10^{13}$~cm) and a mass-loss rate of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, with CSM and ejecta masses of $\sim 0.22$ and $0.12$~$M_{\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve and spectral modeling favor a $\sim 3$~$M_{\odot}$ helium-star progenitor with extended ($\sim 10^{15}$~cm), stratified CSM (density exponent $n=2.9$) and a mass-loss rate of $0.1$--$2.7$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss regimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or temporal changes in the progenitor's mass loss. This behavior is compatible with both binary and single-star evolution. We argue that the early Icn-like features arise from hot carbon ionization and fade to Ibn-like signatures as the ejecta and CSM cool, making SN~2023xgo a rare probe of the connection between SNe~Icn, SNe~Ibn, and Ibn events with ejecta signatures.</description>

      <title>Testing the Lense-Thirring Precession Origin of the QPO in Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of the newly discovered black hole transient Swift J1727.8$-$1613, based on broadband (2$-$150 keV) observations from $Insight$-HXMT during its 2023 outburst. We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the corona radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\rm g}$ during the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\nu_{\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Complete reflection of nonlinear electromagnetic waves in underdense pair plasmas enabled by dynamically formed Bragg-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using kinetic simulations and theory, we show that nonlinear electromagnetic waves can make even strongly underdense pair plasmas fully reflective. As the wave compresses and accelerates the plasma, weak reflection seeds a periodic train of density spikes that grow rapidly due to mass symmetry. This moving Bragg-like grating increases reflection and momentum transfer, enabling a transition to a regime where the relativistic plasma-vacuum interface sustains complete reflection. Finite temperature raises the full-reflection density threshold, yet the corresponding density can remain underdense.</description>
