      <title>Iterative variational learning of committor-consistent transition pathways using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a neural-network-based approach to discover meaningful transition pathways underlying complex biomolecular transformations in coherence with the committor function. The proposed path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) iteratively refines the transition pathway by aligning it to the gradient of the committor. This method addresses the challenges of sampling in molecular dynamics simulations rare events in high-dimensional spaces, which is often limited computationally. Applied to various benchmark potentials and biological processes such as peptide isomerization and protein-model folding, PCCANN successfully reproduces established dynamics and rate constants, while revealing bifurcations and alternate pathways. By enabling precise estimation of transition states and free-energy barriers, this approach provides a robust framework for enhanced-sampling simulations of rare events in complex biomolecular systems.</description>

      <title>MEP-Net: Generating Solutions to Scientific Problems with Limited Knowledge by Maximum Entropy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy principle (MEP) offers an effective and unbiased approach to inferring unknown probability distributions when faced with incomplete information, while neural networks provide the flexibility to learn complex distributions from data. This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, the MEP-Net, which combines the MEP with neural networks to generate probability distributions from moment constraints. We also provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of the maximum entropy principle, its mathematical formulations, and a rigorous justification for its applicability for non-equilibrium systems based on the large deviations principle. Through fruitful numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the MEP-Net can be particularly useful in modeling the evolution of probability distributions in biochemical reaction networks and in generating complex distributions from data.</description>

      <title>Extracting self-similarity from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of self-similarity is an indispensable tool for understanding and modelling physical phenomena. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex problems. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in five problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, a collapsing cavity, and grid-generated turbulence. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind-tunnel experiments. The algorithm recovers the known self-similarity expressions in the first four problems and generates new insights in the final problem (grid turbulence).</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Impacts Single-Molecule FRET Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first principle physics and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume. Our models provide the most up-to-date and accurate estimation of FRET.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent System for Cosmological Parameter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>

      <title>Understanding complex crowd dynamics with generative neural simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge crucial for designing efficient urban infrastructure and ensuring safe crowd management. To this end, both small-scale laboratory and large-scale real-world measurements have been used. However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven Neural Crowd Simulator (NeCS), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topological nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</description>
