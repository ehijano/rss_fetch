      <title>Continuum limit of generalized charm susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in detail the sensitivity of the fourth-order charm fluctuation, calculated on the lattice, to the input bare charm quark mass. We approach its continuum limit by employing four different lines of constant physics. We quantify the cutoff effects arising due to bare charm quark mass for both coarser and finer lattices. Finally, we show that the ratios of generalized charm susceptibilities, calculated on coarser lattices, and the continuum-extrapolated fourth-order charm fluctuation are sufficient to obtain the continuum limit of all physical observables relevant to open charm physics.</description>

      <title>Second order fluctuations of conserved charges in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice QCD investigation of second-order fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges -- baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), and strangeness (S) -- in the presence of external magnetic fields. Our study employs lattice simulations of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical pion masses using highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) on $48^3 \times 12$ and $32^3 \times 8$ lattices, covering a wide range of magnetic field strengths up to $eB \simeq 0.8$ GeV$ ^2$. We identify clear signals of magnetic field-induced modifications to these fluctuations and correlations, with the baryon-electric charge correlation, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, exhibiting particularly strong sensitivity to the magnetic field. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and construct proxy observables for fluctuations measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. Our findings highlight $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ as a promising ``magnetometer" for probing the presence of magnetic fields in QCD matter. Furthermore, we explore experimentally relevant ratios involving $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, demonstrating their potential in mitigating volume effects and enhancing sensitivity to magnetic fields in collision environments. Additionally, we assess the limitations of the HRG model at strong magnetic fields, revealing deviations that indicate nontrivial modifications to hadronic degrees of freedom. These results offer new insights into the interplay between thermal and magnetic effects in the QCD phase diagram and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</description>

      <title>Chiral and deconfinement thermal transitions at finite quark spin polarization in lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of finite spin quark density on the chiral and deconfinement thermal transitions using numerical simulations of lattice QCD with two dynamical light quarks. The finite spin density is introduced by the quark spin potential in the canonical formulation of the spin operator. We show that both chiral and deconfinement temperatures are decreasing functions of the spin potential. We determine the parabolic curvatures of transition temperatures in a limit of physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>The isoscalar octet axial form factor of the nucleon from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isoscalar axial-vector form factor of the nucleon plays a key role in understanding the electroweak interaction of nucleons. For the interpretation of the spin structure of the nucleon the non-singlet isoscalar axial charge is indispensable. Moreover, $G_A^{u+d-2s}(Q^2)$ together with the isovector and singlet isoscalar form factors are needed for the flavor-decomposition of the axial-vector form factor. Detailed knowledge of the flavor decomposition facilitates extractions of Standard Model (SM) parameters from low energy experiments such as the electroweak charge of the proton in the P2 experiment. Here we present a lattice determination of $G_A^{u+d-2s}(Q^2)$ on $N_f=2+1$ $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved Wilson fermions, with a full error budget concerning extrapolations and interpolations to the continuum and infinite volume and physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Search for doubly charmed dibaryons in baryon-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the doubly charmed dibaryon system with quantum numbers $IJ=01$, and strangeness numbers $S=0$, $-2$ and $-4$ in the framework of the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness numbers $S=-2$ is obtained in the $\Lambda\Omega_{cc}$ scattering channel, which are $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast}\Xi$ with resonance mass 5081 MeV and decay width 0.3 MeV, and the $\Xi_{c}\Xi_{c}^{\ast}$ state with the mass 5213 MeV and decay width 19.8 MeV, respectively. These two predicted charmed dibaryon candidates are worth searching for experimentally. Besides, we would like to emphasize that the multi-channel coupling calculation is important to confirm the existence of multiquark states. The coupling can shift the energy of the resonance, give the width to the resonance and even destroy the resonance. Therefore, to provide the necessary information for experiments to search for exotic hadron states, the coupling calculation between the bound channels and open channels is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO in nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) is an efficient tool for solving nuclear many-body problems, which takes high-fidelity lattice chiral interactions as input and computes nuclear low-energy observables via quantum Monte Carlo techniques. In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Quark Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is investigated in the deconfined region of the QCD phase diagram (as a model for Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) emerging in Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC)), using the Kubo formula to calculate a linear response to the chiral imbalance, and the Field Correlator Method to address the strong interaction in QCD. The estimate suggests that CME is severely suppressed in most of the QCD phase diagram, except within a narrow strip at baryon densities above nuclear and temperatures just above the deconfinement transition. The result suggests refining the conditions under which the CME might be observable -- prioritizing the conditions at lower energy RHIC-BES, SPS and upcoming FAIR, NICA, J-PARC-HI, which supposedly produce high baryon density QGP, over the higher energy RHIC and LHC, which produce high temperature QGP.</description>

      <title>First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD study of $\Lambda_c \Lambda_c$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice result of the near threshold $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ scattering with $I(J^P) = 0(0^+)$. The calculation is performed on two $N_f = 2+1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with pion mass $m_\pi \sim 303$\,MeV and lattice spacing $a = 0.07746$\,fm. The L\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to extract the scattering parameters from the finite-volume spectrum. The coupled channel $\Xi_{cc}N$ is ignored in the scattering analysis based on the observation that the energy levels computed from the $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_{cc}N$ operators do not mix. The $\Sigma_c\Sigma_c$ channel is not included either since the energy range explored in this study is well below its threshold. Our results indicate that the interaction in the $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ single channel is repulsive, and the scattering length is determined to be $a_0 = -0.21(4)(8)$\,fm, where the first error is the statistical error and the second is the systematic error.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decays of $B_{l4}$ offer an independent method for determining the CKM matrix element $\vert V_{ub} \vert$, with a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors serving as a crucial component in this process. We present a comprehensive QCD analysis of the $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors within the framework of light-cone sum rules, employing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2\pi$DAs). For the first time, the twist-three distribution amplitudes are explicitly defined, and their contributions are systematically calculated. Leveraging the recently measured partial decay fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ by the Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 4.27 \pm 0.49\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.55\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ within the dominant region of the $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the relatively small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extracted from $B \to \rho l \nu$, when compared to the golden channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, arises due to the finite width and nonresonant effects. We anticipate future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays, which will aid in reducing uncertainties by enhancing our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the $2\pi$DAs through heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>
