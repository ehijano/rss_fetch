      <title>Using lattice chiral effective theory to study pi-pi scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use lattice field theory to study the finite-volume energy spectrum of the $\pi\pi$ system in $SU(2)$ chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) at leading order in the chiral expansion. We compare our results with the finite volume spectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512, 2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD calculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same physical volume. However, we find significant differences between the two calculations in the isospin $I=0$ channel. In particular, there is a nearly stable $\sigma$ resonance in our lattice ChEFT calculation, which is absent in the lattice QCD calculation. This likely indicates that ChEFT does not converge well with a naive lattice regularization.</description>

      <title>The Truncated Hankel Correlator Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to approximate Euclidean correlation functions by exponential sums. The Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC) method builds a Hankel matrix from the full correlator data available and truncates the eigenspectrum of said Hankel matrix. It proceeds by applying the Prony generalised eigenvalue method to the thus obtained low-rank approximation. A large number of algebraic correlator analysis methods including (block) Prony (and equivalently (block) Lanczos) and the generalised eigenvalue problem (GEVP) can be reproduced as sub-optimal special cases of the THC method. Weights, for instance inverse square errors, can be included in the analysis, so that the result has a close to optimal $\chi^2$-value. This makes the THC method very similar in spirit to a closed form solution to multi-state fits, naturally including the case of matrix-valued correlators. We show that, in general, finding approximations better than those provided by the THC method is exponentially hard in the number of exponentials. Moreover, the THC method is robust against noise and requires comparably little human oversight. Finally, when applied to symmetric data, the obtained energy spectrum is guaranteed to be symmetric up to machine precision.</description>

      <title>Preparation of initial states with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices using matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement-Higgs continuity in ${\rm SU(2)}$ adjoint Higgs model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature phase structure of the four-dimensional ${\rm SU(2)}$ adjoint Higgs model, focusing on a possible deconfinement-Higgs continuity: the conjecture that the high-temperature deconfined phase of Yang-Mills theory and the finite-temperature Higgs phase form a single thermodynamic phase. We combine three approaches: (i) global symmetry analysis, showing that Higgs and deconfined regimes are expected to share the same symmetry pattern distinct from the confined phase; (ii) a deformation analysis, which yields an explicit continuous path between ``deconfined symmetric'' and ``deconfined Higgs'' regions in a reduced three-dimensional lattice model; and (iii) Hybrid Monte Carlo analysis on $16^3\times 8$ and $12^3\times 6$ lattices, showing results suggestive of continuity. These results indicate that the Higgs and deconfined regimes can be continuously connected, while the confined phase remains distinct.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>$\text{QED}_\text{r}$: a finite-volume QED action with redistributed spatial zero-momentum modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-volume QED action designed to improve the infinite-volume extrapolation of hadronic observables in precision lattice QCD+QED calculations. The action proposed in this work, which we call $\text{QED}_\text{r}$, can be seen as a particular case of the infrared-improved QED actions introduced by Davoudi et al. in 2019, and is specifically designed to remove kinematics-independent finite-volume corrections that appear at $\mathrm{O}(1/L^3)$ in the commonly used $\text{QED}_\text{L}$ formulation, where $L$ is the spatial extent of the physical volume. For a number of key observables, these effects depend on the internal structure of the hadrons and are difficult to evaluate non-perturbatively, making an analytical subtraction of the finite-volume effects impractical. We explicitly study the $\text{QED}_\text{r}$ electromagnetic finite-size effects on hadron masses and leptonic decay rates, relevant for Standard Model precision tests using the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements. In addition, we propose methods to remove the kinematics-dependent $\mathrm{O}(1/L^3)$ effects in leptonic decays. The removal of such contributions, shifting the leading contamination to $\mathrm{O}(1/L^4)$, will help to reduce the systematic uncertainties associated with finite-volume effects in future lattice QCD+QED calculations.</description>

      <title>Method for high-precision determination of the nucleon axial structure using lattice QCD: Removing $\pi N$-state contamination</title>

Abstract: We performed a precise calculation of physical quantities related to the axial structure of the nucleon using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD gauge configuration (PACS10 configuration) generated at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\mathrm{fm}})^4$ by the PACS Collaboration. The nucleon matrix element of the axial-vector current has two types of the nucleon form factors, the axial-vector ($F_A$) form factor and the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) form factor. Recently lattice QCD simulations have succeeded in reproducing the experimental value of the axial-vector coupling, $g_A$, determined from $F_A(q^2)$ at zero momentum transfer $q^2=0$, at a percent level of statistical accuracy. However, the $F_P$ form factor so far has not reproduced the experimental values well due to strong $\pi N$ excited-state contamination. Therefore, we proposed a simple subtraction method for removing the so-called leading $\pi N$-state contribution, and succeeded in reproducing the values obtained by two experiments of muon capture on the proton and pion electro-production for $F_P(q^2)$. The novel approach can also be applied to the nucleon pseudoscalar matrix element to determine the pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factor with the help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting form factors, $F_P(q^2)$ and $G_P(q^2)$, are in good agreement with the prediction of the pion-pole dominance model. In the new analysis, the induced pseudoscalar coupling $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ can be evaluated with a few percent accuracy including systematic uncertainties using existing data calculated at two lattice spacings.</description>
