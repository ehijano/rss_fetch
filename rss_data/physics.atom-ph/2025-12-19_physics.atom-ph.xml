      <title>Precision continuous-wave laser measurement of the $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a 4.9\,ppb measurement of the positronium $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval using continuous-wave two-photon laser spectroscopy. The transition is detected via photoionization by the same excitation laser. The resulting positrons are guided to a microchannel plate detector, surrounded by scintillators to detect the annihilation photons in coincidence, thereby reducing the background. A Monte Carlo lineshape simulation, accounting for effects such as the second-order Doppler shift and the AC Stark shift, is used to extract a transition frequency of $1233607224.1(6.0)\,\text{MHz}$, consistent with the previous 2.6\,ppb determination of this transition and with the most recent QED calculations at order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^7\ln^2(1/\alpha))$, which predict $1233607222.12(58)\,\text{MHz}$. Combining the two measurements gives $1233607218.1(2.8)\,\text{MHz}$, reducing the tension with QED to about $1.4\,\sigma$. We also present a semi-analytical lineshape model of $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ of positronium, which shows excellent agreement with detailed simulations and is validated by the experimental data. This expands on previous work with stable atoms by incorporating effects such as limited lifetime of the atoms, photoionization and AC Stark shift. The lineshape modelling is also applicable to other unstable systems, such as muonium. This provides a powerful tool for optimizing the experimental parameters and gaining deeper insights without the need for computationally intensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Calculation of hyperfine structure in Tm \textsc{ii}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurements of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants A in singly ionized thulium revealed substantial discrepancies with the corresponding calculations [Mansour et al., NIMB \textbf{40}, 252 (1989)]. More recent measurements [Kebapc{\i} et al., ApJ \textbf{970}, 23 (2024)] expanded very limited dataset of that work and demonstrated that two of the previously reported experimental A values were incorrect, motivating new theoretical calculations. In this work, we employ the configuration interaction method to calculate the A constants for several low-lying levels in Tm II, with the random-phase-approximation corrections also taken into account. Our results show good agreement with the new experimental data and provide reliable predictions for additional states where measurements are not yet available.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent bounds on Beyond the Standard Model bosons from spectroscopy of muonic atoms with magic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy of muonic atoms is, to date, the most accurate technique to extract parameters of the nuclear charge density. The same reasons for their heightened sensitivity to nuclear parameters, a large overlap of the muonic wavefunction with the nucleus, makes them attractive systems to test Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Physics. This raises concerns of self-consistency as the same data are used to, first, extract nuclear parameters, and second, check the consistency with BSM models. We combine the two steps and self-consistently extract the nuclear and BSM parameters. We show that the data are consistent with vanishing BSM coupling and extract robust exclusion bounds. We further note that the nuclear parameters change under the influence of those BSM couplings on the parameter fits and compare with the fit solely based on quantum electrodynamics (QED).</description>

      <title>Electric field diagnostics in a continuous rf plasma using Rydberg-EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger tracking of coherence loss during bond breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled electronic and nuclear motions govern chemical reactions, yet disentangling their interplay during bond rupture remains challenging. Here we follow the light-induced fragmentation of Br$_2$ using a coincidence-based multi-messenger approach. A UV pulse prepares the dissociative state, and strong-field ionization probes the evolving system. Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling. Supported by semiclassical modelling, the results show that the stretched Br$_2$ molecule behaves as a two-centre interferometer in which the loss of coherence between atomic centres encodes the coupled evolution of electrons and nuclei. Our work establishes a general framework for imaging ultrafast electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>Feedback Cooling and Thermometry of a Single Trapped Ion Using a Knife Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first feedback cooling of a single trapped ion below the Doppler limit of $\hbar\Gamma/2 k_\mathrm{B}$. The motion of a single ion is monitored in real-time and cooled up to 9-times below the Doppler cooling temperature by applying electronic feedback. Real-time motion detection is implemented by imaging the fluorescence photons emitted by the ion onto a knife edge and detecting the transmitted light, a method used so far to cool trapped nanoparticles. The intensity modulation of the fluorescence resulting from the ion motion is used to generate and apply the feedback signal and also to determine the ion temperature. The method benefits from a high rate of detected scattered photons, which can be a challenge, and which we address by using a parabolic mirror for collecting the fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Parity Nonconservation in Rb and Sr$^+$ due to Low-Mass Vector Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the parity non-conserving (PNC) electric-dipole ($E1$) transition amplitudes for the $5s - 6s$ and $5s - 4d_{3/2}$ transitions in Rb and Sr$^+$. Our results include both the nuclear-spin-independent and nuclear-spin-dependent contributions, with particular emphasis on the potential effects of a hypothetical additional $Z'$-boson. We highlight possible advantages of using light atoms in searches for such new interaction. The ratio of the contribution of a low mass $Z'$-boson to the contribution of the Standard model $Z$-boson to PNC effects increases rapidly (faster than $1/Z^2$) with decreasing nuclear charge $Z$. Another advantage is that theoretical interpretations of experiments in lighter systems may be carried out with a higher accuracy than that in Cs, Ba$^+$, Fr and Ra$^+$.</description>

      <title>Spectrometry of Captured Highly Charged Ions Produced Following Antiproton Annihilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the first capture and time-of-flight spectrometry of highly charged ions (HCIs) produced following antiproton annihilations in a Penning-Malmberg trap. A multi-step nested-trap technique was developed using the \aegis\ experiment to identify annihilation-linked captured ions. The trapping and spectrometry of helium and argon ions demonstrates the approach. This work establishes a foundation for the in-trap synthesis of radioactive HCIs and the study of cold nuclear annihilation fragments, with the long-term goal of enabling a sensitive tool for probing the outer nuclear periphery.</description>
