      <title>Miniaturized chip calorimeter for high-pressure cells at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat capacity measurements under high pressure places high demands on the calorimeter. Here we describe the development of a miniaturized nanocalorimeter for high-pressure heat capacity measurements at low temperature. The device, fabricated on a silicon substrate, employs a high-frequency AC calorimetry technique and features a design with an outer diameter of 300 ${\mu}$m and thickness of 25-40 ${\mu}$m, small enough to fit into high pressure diamond anvil cells. Miniaturization is achieved by stacking all components, including thermometer and heaters, within a central area. The thin-film calorimeter thermometer measures 40 ${\mu}$m square and maintains the sensitivity and properties of larger thermometers. The fabrication process uses controlled anisotropic etch to produce calorimeter chips with a balance between robustness and thickness, suitable for experiments at high pressures and low temperatures. The calorimeter operates at a relatively high characteristic frequency between 10 Hz and 1 kHz, constraining the thermal oscillation to an effective volume dominated by the sample, thereby avoiding the use of a suspended membrane that is the basis for conventional nanocalorimeters.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Modeling and Analysis of UAV Air-Ground Channels at 1 and 4 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless communications, a better understanding of propagation characteristics and an accurate channel model are required. Measurements and comprehensive analysis for the UAV-based air-ground (AG) propagation channel in the vertical dimension are presented in this letter. Based on the measurement data at 1 and 4 GHz, the large-scale and small-scale channel parameters are extracted in the line-of-sight (LOS) and nonLOS case, respectively. The altitude-dependent path loss model is proposed herein. Furthermore, shadow fading and fast fading are statistically analyzed for comprehensively describing the fading behavior. Our results will be useful in the modeling of AG channels and the performance analysis for UAV-enabled wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>5G Channel Models for Railway Use Cases at mmWave Band and the Path Towards Terahertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed trains are one of the most relevant scenarios for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications and the "smart rail mobility" vision, where a high-data-rate wireless connectivity with up to several GHz bandwidths will be required. This is a strong motivation for the exploration of millimeter wave (mmWave) band. In this article, we identify the main challenges and make progress towards realistic 5G mmWave channel models for railway use cases. In order to cope with the challenge of including the railway features in the channel models, we define reference scenarios to help the parameterization of channel models for railway use at mmWave band. Simulations and the subsequent measurements used to validate the model reflect the detailed influence of railway objects and the accuracy of the simulations. Finally, we point out the future directions towards the full version of the smart rail mobility which will be powered by terahertz (THz) communications.</description>

      <title>LET measurements and simulation modelling of the charged particle field for the Clatterbridge ocular proton therapy beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton therapy can achieve a highly targeted treatment by utilising the advantageous dosimetric characteristics of the Bragg Peak. Protons traversing through a material will deposit their maximum energy at the Bragg Peak through ionisation and other interactions, transferring minimal excess dose to surrounding tissue and organs. This rate of energy loss is also quantified by the linear energy transfer (LET), which is indicative of radiation quality and radiobiological effects. However it is a challenging physical quantity to measure, as characterisation of radiation fields and the impact of LET on treatment requires advanced tools and technology. The MiniPIX-Timepix is a miniaturised, hybrid semiconductor pixel detector capable of high resolution spectrometric tracking, enabling wide-range detection of the deposited energy, position and direction of single particles. Experimental measurements were performed at a clinical facility, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre which houses a 60 MeV ocular proton therapy beamline. A realistic end-to-end model of the facility was developed in the Monte Carlo code TOPAS (TOol for PArticle Simulation) and was used to simulate the experimental conditions. The detector was held at 45$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ perpendicular to the beam, and placed downstream of various thickness Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks to acquire data along the dose deposition depth. Empirical cluster data providing track length and the energy deposition distributions were used to obtain the LET spectra. The determined values for the LET in silicon and dose averaged LET across the BP show general agreement with simulated results, supporting the applicability of the TOPAS CCC model. This work explores the capability of the MiniPIX detector to measure physical quantities to resolve the LET, and discusses experimental considerations and further possibilities.</description>

      <title>MuonSLab: A plastic scintillator based detector for muon measurement in the deep ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric muons are important probes for studying primary cosmic rays and extensive air showers. Additionally, they constitute a significant background for many underground and deep-sea neutrino experiments, such as TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). Understanding the muon flux at various depths in the deep sea is essential for validating TRIDENT simulations and guiding the development of optimized trigger strategies. This paper introduces a novel device based on plastic scintillalors and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) named MuonSLab, which is designed to measure muon flux in the deep sea and has the potential to be extended to other atmospheric muon property measurements. We discuss the design and instrumentation of MuonSLab and present results from several muon flux measurements, demonstrating its sensitivity to muon detection and its stability during operations across multiple locations.</description>

      <title>Ion manipulation from liquid Xe to vacuum: Ba-tagging for a nEXO upgrade and future $0 \nu \beta \beta$ experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay {($0\nu\beta\beta$)} provides a way to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The upcoming nEXO experiment will search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{136}$Xe with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years at the 90\% confidence level using a liquid xenon (LXe) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with 5 tonnes of Xe enriched to $\sim$90\% in the {$\beta \beta$}-decaying isotope $^{136}$Xe. In parallel, a potential future upgrade to nEXO is being investigated with the aim to further suppress radioactive backgrounds and to confirm $\beta \beta$-decay events. This technique, known as Ba-tagging, comprises extracting and identifying the $\beta \beta$-decay daughter $^{136}$Ba ion. One tagging approach being pursued involves extracting a small volume of LXe in the vicinity of a potential $\beta \beta$-decay using a capillary tube and facilitating a liquid-to-gas phase transition by heating the capillary exit. The Ba ion is then separated from the accompanying Xe gas using a radio-frequency (RF) carpet and RF funnel, conclusively identifying the ion as $^{136}$Ba via laser-fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, an accelerator-driven Ba ion source is being developed to validate and optimize this technique. The motivation for the project, the development of the different aspects, along with the current status and results, are discussed here.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of dual readout calorimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual readout calorimeters allow state-of-the-art resolutions for hadronic energy measurements. Their various incarnations are leading candidates for the calorimeter systems for future colliders. In this paper, we present a simple formula for the resolution of a dual readout calorimeter, which we verify with a toy simulation and with full simulation results. This formula can help those new to dual readout calorimetry understand its strengths and limitations. The paper also highlights that the dual readout correction works not just to compensate for binding energy loss, but also for energies escaping the calorimeter or clustering algorithm. Formulae are also presented for approximate resolutions and energy scales in terms of different sources of response.</description>

      <title>Integrating high-precision and fringe-scale displacement sensing using heterodyne cavity-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $260 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $46 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>
