      <title>Simulating High-Velocity Clouds in the Observational Plane: An Initial Study with the Smith Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) may fuel future star formation in the Milky Way, but they must first survive their passage through the hot halo. While recent work has improved our understanding of the survival criterion for cloud-wind interactions, few observational comparisons exist that test this criterion. We therefore present an initial comparison of simulations with the Smith Cloud (SC; $d=$ 12.4 kpc, $l, b = 40^{\circ}, -13^{\circ}$) as mapped with the GALFA-HI survey. We use the Smith Cloud's observed properties to motivate simulations of comparable clouds in wind tunnel simulations with Enzo-E, an MHD code. For both observations and simulations, we generate moment maps, characterize turbulence through a projected first-order velocity structure function (VSF), and do the same for HI column density with a normalized autocovariance function. We explore how initial cloud conditions (such as radius, metallicity, thermal pressure, viewing angle, and distance) affect these statistics, demonstrating that the small-scale VSF is sensitive to cloud turbulence while large scales depend on cloud bulk velocity and viewing angle. We find that some simulations reproduce key observational features (particularly the correlation between column density and velocity dispersion) but none match all observational probes at the same time (the large scales of the column density autocovariance is particularly challenging). We find that the simulated cloud (cloud C) showing growth via a turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) is the best match, implying the importance of TRML-mediated cooling for Milky Way HVCs. We conclude by suggesting improvements for simulations to better match observed HVCs.</description>

      <title>Stellar populations in STARFORGE II: Comparison with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that most star-forming regions in our Galaxy form stellar associations rather than bound clusters. We analyse models from the STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements, unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However, observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference and the length of the embedded phase.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-wave observations of Euclid Deep Field South using the South Pole Telescope: A data release of temperature maps and catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has observed over 10,000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0, 1.4 mm, respectively) overlapping the ongoing 14,000 square-degree Euclid Wide Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field observations in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S). Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5$\sigma$ detection thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass $M_{500c}=2.12 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$ and median redshift $z$ = 0.70, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This work serves as the first step towards joint projects between SPT and Euclid and provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their environments.</description>

      <title>The origin of the metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies: Insights from {\nu}2GC semi-analytic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the observed metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies using the semi-analytic galaxy formation model nu2GC. Our fiducial model successfully reproduces the observed metallicity differences in local galaxies while simultaneously matching the potential-metallicity relations of both star-forming and passive galaxies. By varying the star formation efficiency, we identify strangulation as the primary driver of the metallicity difference. This finding highlights the critical role of star formation timescales in explaining the observed metallicity difference. Our results suggest that metallicity differences serve as a valuable diagnostic for evaluating star formation models in both semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations. Furthermore, galaxies quenched by processes resembling strangulation -- where the supply of cold gas is halted in a slowly growing halo -- exhibit higher metallicities than star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass. In our model, this occurs in isolated, low-mass galaxies where rapid cooling leads to an effect resembling strangulation due to the discrete treatment of gas accretion onto dark matter halos. We propose that the metallicities of isolated, low-mass passive galaxies could provide key insights into refining models of hot gas halo growth.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Gaia Enceladus experiencing at least two passages around the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major recent breakthroughs has been the discovery of the last Major Merger to happen in the history of the Milky Way. Around 10 Gyr ago the galaxy Gaia Enceladus, with estimated ~10% of the Milky Way mass, fell into its potential, bringing a large amount of stars which can be identified through their unique chemical and kinematic signatures. Simulations have long predicted that a galaxy of this size should experience several passages through the disk of the Milky Way before eventually being fully dispersed. For the first time, we present observational evidence to support this. We identify two subpopulations accreted from Gaia Enceladus: 1) stars which today have large kinematic energy, which originate from the outskirts of Gaia Enceladus and were accreted during early passages; 2) stars with low kinetic energy accreted at later passages, originating from the inner parts of Gaia Enceladus. Through the use of high-precision chemical abundances, crucially including new aluminum measurements, we show that in all observed abundance ratios ([Fe/H], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Mg/Ba]), stars with high energy show evidence of coming from a less chemically evolved outer region of Gaia Enceladus, compared to the stars with low energy. We therefore conclude that Gaia Enceladus experienced several passages before merging with the main body of our Galaxy. This discovery has wide implications for our understanding of this event, and consolidates Gaia Enceladus as a benchmark for studying galaxy mergers and hierarchical galaxy formation in extraordinary details.</description>

      <title>Mocking IFU observations and metallicity diagnostics from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations are powerful tools for studying galaxy formation. However, it is crucial to test and improve the sub-grid physics underlying these simulations by comparing their predictions with observations. To this aim, observable quantities can be derived for simulated galaxies, enabling the analysis of simulated properties through an observational approach. Our goal is to develop a new numerical tool capable of generating synthetic emission line spectra from spatially resolved regions in simulated galaxies, mocking Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations. Synthetic spectra of simulated galaxies are produced by integrating the software CIGALE with the outcomes of hydrodynamical simulations. We consider contributions of both stellar populations and nebular emission. The nebular emission lines in the spectra are modeled by considering only the contributions from the simulated star-forming regions. Our model considers the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium to estimate the ionizing parameters, the metallicity, the velocity dispersion and the electron density. We present the new numerical tool PRISMA. Leveraging synthetic spectra generated by our model, PRISMA successfully computed and recovered the intrinsic values of the star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in local regions of simulated galaxies. Additionally, we examine the behavior of metallicity tracers such as N2, R23, O3N2, N2O2, recovered by PRISMA and propose new calibrations based on our simulated result. These findings show the robustness of our tool in recovering the intrinsic properties of simulated galaxies through their synthetic spectra, thereby becoming a powerful tool to confront simulations and observational data.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Milky Way chemical map with Galactic Chemical Evolution tool OMEGA+ from SDSS-MWM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain two-infall galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models simulating the chemical evolution of the Milky Way as constrained by a golden sample of $394,000$ stellar abundances of the Milky Way Mapper survey from the 19th data release of SDSS-V. The separation between the chemical thin and thick disks is defined using [Mg/M]. We use the chemical evolution environment $\texttt{OMEGA+}$, combined with Levenberg-Marquardt and bootstrapping. We simulate the entire Galactic disk and six galactocentric regions for a more detailed analysis of the formation of the inner, middle, and outer Galaxy. We investigate the evolution of $\alpha$, odd-Z, and iron-peak elements: 15 species altogether. The chemical thin and thick disks are separated by Mg observations, which the other $\alpha$-elements show similar trends with, while odd-Z species demonstrate different patterns as functions of metallicity. In the inward Galactic disk regions the locus of the low-Mg sequence is gradually shifted toward higher metallicity, while the high-Mg phase is less populated. The best-fit GCE models show a well-defined peak in the rate of the infalling matter as a function of the Galactic age, confirming a merger event about $10$ Gyr ago. We show that the timescale of gas accretion, the time of the second infall as well as the ratio between the surface mass densities associated to the second infall and the formation event vary with the distance from the Galactic center. The disk is assembled within a timescale of $(0.32\pm0.02)~$Gyr during a primary formation phase, then a $(0.55\pm0.06)~$Gyr-timescale, increasing accretion rate was followed by a relaxation that lasted $(2.86\pm0.70)~$Gyr, with a second peak of the infall rate at $(4.13\pm0.19)~$Gyr. Our best Galaxy evolution models are consistent with an inside-out formation scenario of the Milky Way disk, in agreement with recent chemo-dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Phase-space distortion as a key to unraveling galactic bar buckling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the resonant structure of $N$-body galactic bar at the stage of buckling using action-angle variables. We studied the evolution of vertical actions ($J_z$) and angles associated with vertical resonance ($\theta_\mathrm{res}=\theta_z - \theta_R$) for all orbits in the bar. For this purpose, we divide the orbits into types according to the behavior (libration or circulation) of their resonant angle with respect to fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ (vertical resonance). We show that during buckling, flat bar orbits circulating with increasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ transformed into banana-shaped librating orbits (resonant capture) or circulating orbits with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ (resonant heating). The orbital transformation is accompanied by an increase in $J_z$ and the formation of a boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. During buckling, the phase space $J_z - \theta_\mathrm{res}$ undergoes a distortion creating an asymmetry in the position of the fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ and in banana-shaped orbits near these points. The fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ may disappear completely. This also breaks the symmetry between the orbits, which are captured into resonance or go into circulation with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$. At the same time, near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$, banana-shaped orbits with low vertical action $J_z$ appear. This reopens the path of orbital transformation through the fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$. The phase space transformation and orbit transformation occur in a coordinated manner and lead to smoothing of phase space perturbations and restoration of symmetry between orbits.</description>

Abstract: The paper describes a Space-VLBI observation of the 22 GHz H2O masers in the massive star-forming region G25.65+1.05, using the 10-m space antenna of Radioastron together with the ground-based VLBA array. Two observing epochs at the pre-flare and post-flare state of the maser source are presented. Leveraging the exceptional angular resolution provided by space-ground baselines along with the broad UV coverage from VLBA baselines, we gained a detailed perspective on the area associated with the maser flare events.</description>

      <title>Enhanced gas-phase metallicities and suppressed outflows for galaxies in a rich cluster core at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the result of near-infrared spectroscopy using Keck/MOSFIRE for 23 member galaxies in an X-ray cluster XCS2215 ($z=1.46$) to investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous flows and metallicities. We find that the metallicities derived from H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines of the cluster galaxies are enhanced by 0.08-0.15 dex with $\sim$2 $\sigma$ significance compared to field counterparts for the same stellar mass. It suggests that inefficient gas accretion in the shock-heated intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core results in the lack of metallicity dilution. We also estimate the mass-loading factor by comparing the observed galaxies with the chemical evolution model that takes into account the outflow processes on the metallicity versus gas mass fraction diagram constructed together with the ALMA data. We find that the outflows from galaxies in the cluster core region tend to be weaker than those of galaxies in the general field. It is likely due to the confinement of gas by the high pressure of the surrounding ICM in the cluster core, which leads to the recycling of the outflowing gas that comes back to the system and is used for further star formation, resulting in the progression of chemical evolution. Compared with higher redshift protocluster galaxies at $z&gt;2$, which tend to show lower metallicity than the field galaxies due probably to dilution of metals by pristine gas inflow, we are seeing the transition of gas accretion mode from efficient cold stream mode to the inefficient hot mode.</description>

      <title>New insights on low-mass dark matter subhalo tidal tracks via numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies assert that dark matter (DM) subhaloes without a baryonic counterpart and with an inner cusp always survive no matter the strength of the tidal force they undergo. In this work, we perform a suite of numerical simulations specifically designed to analyse the evolution of $V_\mathrm{max}$, $r_\mathrm{max}$ and concentration of low-mass DM subhaloes due to tidal stripping. We employ the improved version of the DASH code, introduced in our previous work arXiv:2207.08652 to investigate subhalo survival. We follow the tidal evolution of a single DM subhalo orbiting a Milky Way (MW)-size halo modeled with a baryonic disc and a bulge replicating the actual mass distribution of the MW. We consider the effect of the time-evolving gravitational potential of the MW itself. We simulate subhaloes with unprecedented accuracy, varying their initial concentration, orbital parameters, and inner slope (both NFW and prompt cusps are considered). Unlike the previous literature, we examine the evolution of subhalo structural parameters -- tidal tracks -- not only at orbit apocentres but also at pericentres, finding in the former case both similarities and differences -- particularly pronounced in the case of prompt cusps. Overall, $r_\mathrm{max}$ shrinks more than $V_\mathrm{max}$, leading to a continuous rise of subhalo concentration with time. The velocity concentration at present is found to be around two orders of magnitude higher than the one at infall, being comparatively larger for pericentre tidal tracks versus apocentres. These findings highlight the dominant role of tidal effects in reshaping low-mass DM subhaloes, providing valuable insights for future research via simulations and observations, such as correctly interpreting data from galaxy satellite populations, subhalo searches with gravitational lensing or stellar stream analyses, and indirect DM searches.</description>

      <title>H${\beta}$ line shape and radius-luminosity relation in 2.5D FRADO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly, we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in the radius-luminosity relation.</description>

      <title>Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP) A Multi-Wavelength Search for the Effects of Metallicity on the Cepheid Distance Scale. Part II: Theoretical Models and Synthetic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the multi-wavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multi-wavelength period-luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance indicators, underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating of the expansion rate of the Universe, Ho. In Paper I (Madore &amp; Freedman 2024) we presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity, and inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK) and into mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 microns). And,in no case were any statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar atmospheres, cov- ering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., factor of 3x above the Milky Way value). The theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically falling back to zero from the red to the far infrared. The discovered effects of metallicity are systematic, but they are small; and as such they do not contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids.</description>

      <title>The $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ Relation of the hyperluminous Dust-obscured Quasars up to $z \sim 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous dust-obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey. The heavy circumnuclear dust obscuration allows only a small amount of scattered light from the obscured quasar to escape, enabling the decomposition of the stellar component from the total flux. The presence of scattered light enables the redshift of the source and the properties of the black hole to be obtained from SDSS and SDSS-related literature. From WISE and SDSS data, we select 11 hyperluminous Hot DOGs at $z=1.5-3.7$ with bolometric luminosities $L_{\rm bol} \gtrsim 10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg \ s^{-1}}$. We investigate the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation in these sources using Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting or with extra constraints from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) image decomposition. Stellar masses are successfully derived for eight Hot DOGs. We find high Eddington ratios $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in these Hot DOGs, with the median value of 1.05 and the maximum value close to 3. The super-Eddington accretion may be associated with the overdense environments of Hot DOGs. We find no significant differences in the $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ of these Hot DOGs compared to the local relation, suggesting that these dust-obscured quasars are the progenitors of massive early-type galaxies. We speculate that the subsequent evolution of Hot DOGs may be significantly influenced by AGN feedback and remain on the local relation.</description>

      <title>Shape Shifting Light Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter consisting of a Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) of ultra-light particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter mass fraction in galaxies with a centrally localized stellar mass (such as a black hole). In the self-gravitating dark matter limit, the predicted cored soliton shape is consistent with previous numerical predictions and analytical approximations. As the dark matter mass fraction decreases, the soliton is predicted to become increasingly cusp shaped, asymptotically approaching an exponential density distribution (isomorphic with a Hydrogen 1s state), with a central slope comparable to that predicted by cold dark matter simulations. The soliton shapes are obtained by solving the associated Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation with the ground state wavefunction represented as a sum of Gaussians with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths. The results are used to express the soliton size, total mass and density directly in terms of the corresponding velocity dispersion, by invoking an approximation relating tracer star rotational velocity and dispersion that is validated by experimental observations. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations. Implications include speculations regarding the possible role of dark matter evaporation in galactic evolution, as well as a light-dark-matter hypothesis that dark matter solitons may be photon condensates, if photons have a non-zero rest mass consistent with the upper bounds established by a wide range of optical and electrodynamic measurements.</description>

      <title>Dense clumps survive in the vicinity of R136 in 30 Doradus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC. Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun, and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas. Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers ($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.</description>

      <title>Binding energies of small interstellar molecules on neutral and charged amorphous solid water surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is all but empty. To date, more than 300 molecules have already been discovered. Because of the extremely low temperature, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by barrierless exothermic reactions of radicals and ions. However, several abundant molecules and organic molecules cannot be produced efficiently by gas-phase reactions. To explain the existence of such molecules in the ISM, gas-surface interactions between small molecules and dust particles covered with amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles must be considered. In general, surface processes such as adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and chemical reactions can be linked to the binding energy of molecules to the surface. Hence, a lot of studies have been performed to identify the binding energies of interstellar molecules on ASW surfaces. Cosmic radiation and free electrons may induce a negative charge on the dust particles, and the binding energies may be affected by this charge. In this study, we calculate the binding energies of CO, CH4, and NH3, on neutral and charged ASW surfaces using DFT calculations. Our results indicate that CO can interact with the surface charge, increasing its binding energy. In contrast, the binding energy of CH4 remains unchanged in the presence of surface charge, and that of NH3 typically decreases.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Measurement Uncertainties on the Inferred Stability of Planes of Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have revealed that the MW, Andromeda, Centaurus A (and potentially other galaxies) host spatially thin and kinematically coherent planes of satellites. Such structures are highly improbable within the standard LCDM cosmological model, and the dynamical stability of these planes has been a subject of debate for a long time. Accurately determining their stability requires a thorough understanding of orbital parameters such as proper motion, distance, and line-of-sight velocity, in addition to the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. However, many of these remain insufficiently constrained, leading to significant uncertainties in any analysis. This research aims to explore the impact of measurement errors in proper motions and distances of the satellite galaxies and in the adopted host halo mass on the inferred stability of satellite planes in Milky-Way-like potentials. Test satellite galaxies orbiting a host galaxy are simulated, mock observed by adding various degrees and types of observational errors, and then backward-integrated. Trends and correlations between the initial conditions and the applied uncertainties on the inferred orbital stability of the satellite systems are analyzed. Additionally, the effects of adopting incorrect potentials and the impact of different orbital eccentricities are considered. Uncertainties in proper motions lead to an inferred, ostensible widening of an intrinsically stable satellite plane, with its width increasing linearly with the adopted proper motion uncertainties. Even uncertainties on the level of Gaia systematics strongly affect the plane's inferred past width. Moreover, the potential with a low halo mass showed a significant impact on the stability of these planes, while the remaining two host models showed similar effects. Uncertainties in satellite distance also contribute noticeably to the inferred, apparent instability.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Polarization Survey. V. Galactic magnetic field tomography in the spiral arms using optical and near-infrared starlight polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight (LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|&lt;1^{\circ}$ and $19.\!\!^{\circ}8&lt;l&lt;25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc), intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $&lt; d &lt; 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $&lt; d &lt; 2.5$ kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other. Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential for kinematically colder HI component as a tracer for star-forming gas in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium, undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation. Kinematically colder HI components, identified via kinematic decomposition of HI 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$). We analyse these colder HI components by decomposing HI 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies - Sextans A, NGC 6822, WLM, NGC 5068, NGC 7793, NGC 1566, and NGC 5236 - spanning metallicities (0.1 &lt; $Z/Z_{\odot}$ &lt; 1.0) and physical scales (53-1134 pc). Using a velocity dispersion threshold of 6 km s$^{-1}$, we classify the kinematically distinct components into narrow (colder) and broad (warmer). Cross-correlation analysis between the narrow HI components and H$_{2}$ or star formation rate (SFR) surface density at different spatial scales reveals that dwarf galaxies exhibit the strongest correlation at ~500-700 pc. The radially binned narrow HI fraction, $f_{\rm n} = I_{\rm narrowHI}/I_{\rm totalHI}$, in dwarf galaxies shows no clear trend with metallicity or SFR, while in spirals, $f_{\rm n}$ is lower in inner regions with higher metallicity and SFR. We find that the dataset resolution significantly impacts the results, with higher physical resolution data yielding a higher median $f_{\rm n}$, $\langle f_{\rm n} \rangle$, per galaxy. With this considered, dwarf galaxies consistently exhibit a larger $f_{\rm n}$ than spiral galaxies. These findings highlight the critical role of cold HI in regulating star formation across different galactic environments and emphasise the need for high-resolution HI observations to further unravel the connection between atomic-to-molecular gas conversion and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Pipeline-Determined Physical Properties of OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.</description>

      <title>SPLASH: A Rapid Host-Based Supernova Classifier for Wide-Field Time-Domain Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of Energy Constraints for Positrons Generating the Galactic Annihilation Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even 50 years after the discovery of a positron annihilation line from the inner Galaxy, no class of astrophysical sources has emerged as a definitive explanation for both the emission morphology and flux. Positrons produced by dark matter annihilation or decay have been proposed, but the mass of any such candidate is constrained by continuum $\gamma$-ray emission at energies $&gt;511$ keV. Earlier analyses have claimed that this emission requires that the positrons have kinetic energies less than a few MeV at injection, disfavoring both much of the dark matter parameter space and many potential compact astrophysical source classes such as pulsars. However, these constraints were not based on a full forward model of the $\gamma$-ray line and continuum data, and did not marginalize over uncertainties about the relative angular distributions of the line and continuum. Here we describe an improved analysis that overcomes these limitations, and show that constraints on the injection energy are much weaker than previously claimed; even under conservative assumptions the data are consistent with initial energies up to $\sim 50$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Low-velocity precessing jets can explain observed morphologies in the Twin Radio Galaxy TRG J104454+354055</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of large-scale radio jets in merger systems has been drastically improved in the era of VLA, VLBA/EVN, uGMRT, and MeerKAT. Twin Radio Galaxies (TRGs) are the rare interacting galaxy pairs where both supermassive black holes host kiloparsec-scale bipolar radio jets. Only recently was a third TRG discovered and it shows significantly different jet morphologies than the previous two. Due to both the extreme paucity and complexity of such systems, the launching of their jets as well as their mutual interaction during the propagation through the ambient medium are not well understood. We have performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the bipolar jets in the third TRG, J104454+354055. Our study indicates that the precession of mutually tilted bipolar jets originating from the two galactic nuclei separated by tens of kiloparsecs and propagating at low velocities can explain the observed morphologies. The simulated jet precession timescales are short compared to the overall dynamical timescale of the jets and could originate from Lense-Thirring effects in the accretion disks. This approach to understanding the TRG jet dynamics could also be applied to other TRG systems with similar helical morphologies that may be discovered in the upcoming era of the SKA and its pathfinder surveys.</description>

      <title>Critical Metallicity of Cool Supergiant Formation. II. Physical Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity ($Z_{\rm c}\sim 0.001$) required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using model grids that vary in mass, metallicity, opacity, and nuclear reaction rates, we identify a threshold terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius ($R_{\rm T}$) that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Through stellar models and homology relations, we show that metallicity affects the TAMS radius via its influence on opacity and nuclear energy generation. By classifying the evolutionary pathways of supergiants, we demonstrate how TAMS radius, shaped by metallicity, decisively governs the post-main-sequence outcome: Stars with metallicities $Z &lt; Z_{\rm c}$ exhibit TAMS radii smaller than $R_{\rm T}$ and proceed to advanced core helium or carbon burning while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing further expansion into the RSG regime. In contrast, stars with $Z &gt; Z_{\rm c}$ have TAMS radii larger than $R_{\rm T}$ and expand into the stable RSG phase during core helium burning. The envelope radius at the onset of core helium burning is the key factor determining whether a star becomes a red or blue supergiant. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of the $z\sim5.7$ Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, spectral resolving power $R\sim2700$ and PRISM, $R\sim100$, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source (spatial resolution $\sim0.15''$ or $\sim0.9$kpc), we find three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of $&lt;10$kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959{,}5007$, [NII]$\lambda\lambda6548{,}6584$, H$\alpha$, and [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716{,}6731$. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Ly$\alpha$ break, rest-frame UV and optical continuum, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726{,}3729$. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density $\left( \rm \log_{10}\left( n_e / cm^{-3}\right)\sim 3\right)$ and metallicity ($\sim0.5-0.7$ solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (possibly indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-0.9$) and significant H$\alpha$ emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. A comparison to high resolution ($\sim0.3''$ or $\sim1.8$kpc) [CII]$158\mu$m imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) reveals areas of dust obscuration. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust $&lt;1$Gyr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Star Formation Histories Reveal Formative Starbursts Experienced by Lyman Alpha Emitting Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test the frequent assumption that Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are experiencing their first major burst of star formation at the time of observation. To this end, we identify 74 LAEs from the ODIN Survey with rest-UV-through-NIR photometry from UVCANDELS. For each LAE, we perform non-parametric star formation history (SFH) reconstruction using the Dense Basis Gaussian process-based method of spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that a strong majority (67%) of our LAE SFHs align with the frequently assumed archetype of a first major star formation burst, with at most modest star formation rates (SFRs) in the past. However, the rest of our LAE SFHs have significant amounts of star formation in the past, with 28% exhibiting earlier bursts of star formation with the ongoing burst having the highest SFR (dominant bursts), and the final 5% having experienced their highest SFR in the past (non-dominant bursts). Combining the SFHs indicating first and dominant bursts, ~95% of LAEs are experiencing their largest burst yet-- a formative burst. We also find that the fraction of total stellar mass created in the last 200 Myr is ~1.3 times higher in LAEs than in mass-matched Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples, and that a majority of LBGs are experiencing dominant bursts, reaffirming that LAEs differ from other star forming galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that multiple evolutionary paths can produce galaxies with strong observed Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. The galaxy (EXCELS-63107) is compact, with a size consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). I. Ordered massive star formation in the outer Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim10\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.</description>

      <title>JFlow: Model-Independent Spherical Jeans Analysis using Equivariant Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>

Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities for given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.</description>

Abstract: Galaxies with polar structures -- of which polar-ring galaxies (PRGs) are a prominent subclass -- contain components that are kinematically decoupled and highly inclined relative to the host galaxy's major axis. Modern deep optical surveys provide a powerful means of detecting low surface brightness (LSB) features around galaxies, offering critical insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies with polar structures. UGC 10043 is an edge-on galaxy notable for its prominent bulge, which extends orthogonally to the disk plane. In addition, the galaxy displays a well-defined integral-shaped disk warp and multiple dust features crossing the bulge along the minor galaxy axis. In this work, we present new deep optical photometry of UGC 10043 down to 29.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and perform a detailed analysis of its LSB and polar structures. The observations reveal a stellar stream aligned along the polar axis, alongside other signatures of tidal interaction, including a flat, tilted LSB envelope that extends toward the neighboring galaxy MCG +04-37-035, with which UGC 10043 is connected by an HI bridge. Our results suggest that the polar component of UGC 10043 comprises and older, triaxial polar bulge and a younger, forming polar structure, likely originating from the ongoing disruption of a dwarf satellite galaxy, while also participating in active interaction with MCG +04-37-035.</description>

      <title>Deblending Overlapping Galaxies in DECaLS Using Transformer-Based Algorithm: A Method Combining Multiple Bands and Data Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large-scale galaxy surveys, particularly deep ground-based photometric studies, galaxy blending is inevitable and poses a potential primary systematic uncertainty for upcoming surveys. Current deblenders predominantly rely on analytical modeling of galaxy profiles, facing limitations due to inflexible and imprecise models. We present a novel approach using a U-net structured transformer-based network for deblending astronomical images, which we term the CAT-deblender. It was trained using both RGB and grz-band images, spanning two distinct data formats from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) database, including galaxies with diverse morphologies. Our method requires only the approximate central coordinates of each target galaxy, bypassing assumptions on neighboring source counts. Post-deblending, our RGB images retain a high signal-to-noise peak, showing superior structural similarity to ground truth. For multi-band images, the ellipticity of central galaxies and median reconstruction error for the r-band consistently lie within +/-0.025 to +/-0.25, revealing minimal pixel residuals. In our comparison focused on flux recovery, our model shows a mere 1 percent error in magnitude recovery for quadruply blended galaxies, significantly outperforming SExtractor's higher error rate of 4.8 percent. By cross-matching with publicly accessible overlapping galaxy catalogs from the DECaLS database, we successfully deblended 433 overlapping galaxies. Furthermore, we demonstrated effective deblending of 63,733 blended galaxy images randomly selected from the DECaLS database.</description>

      <title>GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications</title>

Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</description>

Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>The First Billion Years in Seconds: An Effective Model for the 21-cm Signal with Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18294</link>

Abstract: Observations of the 21-cm signal are opening a window to the cosmic-dawn epoch, when the first stars formed. These observations are usually interpreted with semi-numerical or hydrodynamical simulations, which are often computationally intensive and inflexible to changes in cosmological or astrophysical effects. Here, we present an effective, fully analytic model for the impact of the first stars on the 21-cm signal, using the modular code Zeus21. Zeus21 employs an analytic prescription of the star formation rate density (SFRD) to recover the fully nonlinear and nonlocal correlations of radiative fields that determine the 21-cm signal. We introduce the earliest Population III (Pop III) stars residing in low-mass molecular-cooling galaxies in Zeus21, with distinct spectra from later Pop II stars. We also self-consistently model feedback in the form of $H_2$-dissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, as well as dark matter-baryon relative velocities, both of which suppress star formation in the lowest-mass halos. LW feedback produces a scale-dependence on the SFRD fluctuations, due to the long mean free path of LW photons. Relative velocities give rise to "wiggles" in the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal; we present an improved calculation of the shape of these velocity-induced acoustic oscillations, showing they remain a standard ruler at cosmic dawn. Our improved version of Zeus21 predicts the 21-cm global signal and power spectra in agreement with simulations at the $\sim 10\%$ level, yet is at least three orders of magnitude faster. This public code represents a step towards efficient and flexible parameter inference at cosmic dawn, allowing us to predict the first billion years of the universe in mere seconds.</description>

      <title>Finding White Dwarfs' Hidden Companions using an Unsupervised Machine Learning Technique</title>

Abstract: White dwarfs (WD) with main-sequence (MS) companions are crucial probes of stellar evolution. However, due to the significant difference in their luminosities, the WD is often outshined by the MS star. The aim of this work is to find hidden companions in Gaia's sample of WD candidates. Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using confirmed WDMS binaries from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision of $\sim 90\%$. We demonstrated that the luminosity of the faint companions in the missed systems is $\sim 50$ times lower than that of their WD primaries. Applying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 506 of which have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our sample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\%$. Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to refine and parameterize a ``golden sample'' of 136 WDMS binaries through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs ($\sim 0.42 M_{\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\sim 2800$ K). Finally, 13 systems exhibit periodic variability consistent with eclipsing binaries, making them prime targets for further follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind to explain the 16000 km s$^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Fuzzy Dark Matter Inside Radial Critical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength, governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range $m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.</description>
