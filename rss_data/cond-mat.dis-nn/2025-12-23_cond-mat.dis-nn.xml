      <title>Density of scattering resonances in a disordered system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection of particles from a disordered or chaotic medium is characterized by a scattering matrix that can be represented as a superposition of resonances. Each resonance corresponds to an eigenstate inside the medium and has a width related to the decay time of this eigenstate. We develop a general approach to study the distribution function of these resonance widths based on the nonlinear sigma model. We derive an integral representation of the distribution function that works equally well for systems of any symmetry and for any type of coupling to the measuring device. From this integral representation we find explicit analytic expressions for the distribution function in the case of disordered metallic grains. We also compare the analytic results to large-scale numerical simulations and observe their perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Localization Properties of a Disordered Helical Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the quasiperiodic one-dimensional helical chain with two tunneling paths: nearest-neighbor and a long-range hop that connects sites of consecutive helical turns. Using exact diagonalization, we quantify localization employing the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and the normalized participation ratio (NPR), and combine them into a single measure to create a phase map. The resulting diagrams reveal three regimes: a completely extended phase, a completely localized phase, and a mixed domain where localized and extended states coexist. In the diagrams, we investigate the behaviors of tightly and loosely wound helices and examine a special case where the number of sites per turn is a Fibonacci number. For moderate numbers of sites per helical turn, the mixed region is broad and also shifts with the long-range coupling. When the turn size is a Fibonacci number, the phase boundary becomes nearly horizontal and the mixed region fades out, effectively recovering the standard Aubry-Andr\'e model behavior.</description>

      <title>Localization and persistent currents in a quasiperiodic disordered helical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate localization and persistent currents in a helical tight-binding lattice subject to two independent magnetic fluxes and a quasiperiodic on-site potential. Working with non-interacting, spinless fermions under periodic boundary conditions, we solve the model by exact diagonalization and study localization with both inverse and normalized participation ratios. We identify boundaries separating extended, mixed, and localized regimes by constructing a diagram incorporating potential strength and inter-ring coupling. In the metallic regime, persistent currents flowing around both the toroidal and poloidal directions show oscillations whose amplitude decays as disorder grows and vanishes past the localization threshold; in the localized regime, currents become flux-insensitive. We demonstrate that tuning magnetic fluxes, hopping strengths, or quasiperiodic potential amplitudes provides control over the critical disorder threshold. Our results suggest a versatile platform for disorder-and flux-controlled switching between conductive and insulating states.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Localization in Quasiperiodic Thue-Morse Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate localization and reentrance in a dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding chain whose on-site energies are given by a quasiperiodic cosine masked by a deterministic Thue-Morse sequence. Working with non-interacting, spinless fermions, we solve the model via exact diagonalization on large Fibonacci sizes and diagnose phases using inverse/normalized participation ratios and the correlation fractal dimension. We identify boundaries separating extended, multifractal (mixed), and localized regimes by constructing a phase diagram in the plane of modulation strength and dimerization ratio. As the quasiperiodic amplitude is increased, the system exhibits reentrant behavior, localizing, partially re-delocalizing into a multifractal regime, and re-localizing, verified via two-size crossings of band-averaged observables and finite-size scaling. We demonstrate that tuning the modulation strength, the SSH dimerization, or the incommensurability parameter provides control over the critical thresholds. Our results suggest a versatile, randomness-free platform for the deterministic control of transport, enabling switching between conducting, multifractal, and insulating states.</description>

      <title>Tree tensor networks for many-body localization in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the disordered spin-$\frac12$Heisenberg model in two dimensions and employ tree tensor networks (TTNs) with a physics-informed structural optimization of the tree layout, to simulate dynamics in the many-body localization problem. We find that TTNs are able to capture two-dimensional entanglement patterns more effectively than matrix product states (MPS) while being more efficient to contract than projected entangled pair states (PEPS) to probe larger systems and longer times. Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost.</description>

      <title>Responses to transient perturbation can distinguish intrinsic from latent criticality in spiking neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuitry operates near criticality to reap the computational benefits of accessing a wide range of timescales. The theory of critical phenomena generally predicts heavy-tailed (power-law) correlations in space and time near criticality, but it has been argued that in the brain such correlations could be inherited from ``latent variables,'' such as external sensory signals that are not directly observed when recording from neural circuitry. Distinguishing whether heavy-tailed correlations in neural activity are intrinsically generated within a neural circuit or are driven by unobserved latent variables is crucial for properly interpreting circuit functions. We argue that measuring neural responses to sudden perturbative inputs, rather than correlations in ongoing activity, can disambiguate these cases. We demonstrate this approach in a model of stochastic spiking neuron populations receiving external latent input that can be tuned to a critical state. We propose a scaling theory for the covariance and response functions of the spiking network, which we validate with simulations. We end by discussing how our approach might generalize to models of neural populations with more realistic biophysical details.</description>

      <title>On the origin of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit.</description>

      <title>Noisy Monitored Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy monitored quantum circuits have emerged as a versatile and unifying framework connecting quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of such circuits, with an emphasis on their entanglement structure, information-protection capabilities, and noise-induced phase transitions. A central theme is the mapping to classical statistical models, which reveals how quantum noise reshapes dominant spin configurations. This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction. These developments collectively establish noisy monitored circuits as a powerful platform for probing and controlling quantum dynamics in realistic, decohering environments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical and ultrametric barriers in the energy landscape of jammed granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the mean-field glass theory, the (free) energy landscape of disordered systems is hierarchical and ultrametric if they belong to the full-replica-symmetry-breaking universality class. However, examining this theoretical picture in three-dimensional systems remains challenging, where the energy barriers become finite. Here, we numerically explore the energy landscape of granular models near the jamming transition using a saddle dynamics algorithm to locate both local energy minima and saddles. The multi-scale distances and energy barriers between minima are characterized by two metrics, both of which exhibit signatures of an ultrametric space. The scale-free distribution of energy barriers reveals that the landscape is hierarchical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study boundary critical behavior at the Nishimori multicritical point of the two-dimensional (2D) random-bond Ising model. Using tensor-network methods, we realize a one-parameter family of microscopic boundary conditions by continuously rotating the boundary-spin orientation and find two conformal boundary fixed points that correspond to the free and fixed boundaries. We extract conformal data, including the boundary entropies and the scaling dimensions of boundary primary operators, which characterize the boundary universality class. We further demonstrate that the free boundary fixed point exhibits multifractal scaling of boundary spin fields. Finally, we complement our numerical results with a renormalization group analysis and discuss a systematic bridge between the controlled $6-\epsilon$ expansion and the 2D tensor network numerics.</description>

      <title>Partition Function Estimation Using Analog Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\pm J$ SK model for small $N$'s up to $N=9$. We sort the $2^{N(N-1)/2}$ possible realizations of the coupling matrix into equivalence classes according to the gauge symmetry and permutation symmetry and determine the energy spectra for each of these classes. We also study the energy landscape in these small systems and find that the elements of the hierarchic organization of ground states %and higher energy local minima start to appear in some samples already for $N$'s as small as 6.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Anderson transition - a view from Krylov space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</description>

      <title>Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests</title>

Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis from Eigenstate Typicality and Kinematic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</description>
