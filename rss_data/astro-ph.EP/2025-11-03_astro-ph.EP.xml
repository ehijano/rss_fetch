      <title>Saving Doomed Planets: Mass Loss and Angular Momentum Return Boost Hot Jupiter Survival Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of giant extrasolar planets on short-period orbits ("hot Jupiters") represents a challenge to theories of planet formation. A leading explanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially wide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed configurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant companions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to reproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis studies often predict that many source "cold Jupiters" are destroyed by tidal disruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with improved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by tidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular dynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach to estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new population synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that improved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor of $\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\gtrsim 0.5\%$ around FGK stars) consistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto the star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital periods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results suggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with realistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter formation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.</description>

      <title>Micrometeoroid Impacts: Dual Pathways for Iron Reduction and Oxidation on Lunar and Asteroidal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework NEXOTRANS for Emission Spectroscopy: New Constraints and Atmospheric Characterization of WASP-69b Using JWST NIRCam and MIRI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42 (+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Assessing the metal and rare earth element mining potential of undifferentiated asteroids through the study of carbonaceous chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undifferentiated asteroids, particularly the parent bodies of carbon-rich chondrite groups, might be promising candidates for future space resource utilization due to their primitive composition and potential to host valuable metals and rare earth elements. However, our understanding of their bulk elemental composition remains limited, as most data are derived from reflectance spectra with low mineralogical resolution. Sample return missions have started to change that, as returned materials are already available to study. Still the available meteorites provide a valuable source of information about the diversity of undifferentiated asteroids in the interplanetary space. To improve compositional insights, we conducted Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-AES (Inductively coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) analyses on a representative suite of carbonaceous chondrites. These meteorites, considered analogs of undifferentiated asteroids, preserve materials from the early solar system and provide a geochemical record of their parent bodies. Our results highlight the abundance and distribution of transition metals, siderophile elements, and rare earth elements across several chondrite groups. These findings support the view that C-type asteroids may serve as viable sources of critical materials, while also informing future mission planning, extraction strategies, and the development of new technologies for low-gravity resource operations.</description>

      <title>Stacking transmission spectra of different exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics. As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$ boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks required to rule out a flat spectrum at $&gt;5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in the era of population studies of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Brightness variability in polar circumbinary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary systems with a strongly misaligned disk, the central binary stars can travel a significant vertical distance above and below the disk's orbital plane. This can cause large changes in illumination of the disk over the course of the binary orbital period. We use both analytic and radiative transfer models to examine the effect of changes in stellar illumination on the appearance of the disk, particularly in the case of the polar disk HD 98800B. We find that the observed flux from the disk can vary significantly over the binary orbital period, producing a periodically varying lightcurve which peaks twice each binary orbit. The amount of flux variation is strongly influenced by the disk geometry. We suggest that these flux variations produce several observable signatures, and that these observables may provide constraints on different properties of the disk such as its vertical structure, geometry, and cooling rate.</description>

      <title>Dust and Water in V883 Ori: Relics of a Retreating Snowline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V883 Ori is an FU-Orionis-type outburst system characterized by a shoulder at 50-70 au in its ALMA band 6 and 7 intensity profiles. Previously, this feature was attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water snowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the spectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes in grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80 au, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both features with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk model that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the post-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder and the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline: the shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor recondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor reservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr at the disk atmosphere. As V883 Ori continues to fade, we predict that the intensity shoulder will migrate inward by an observationally significant amount of 10 au over about 25 years.</description>

      <title>Diurnal Variations of Lee Wave Clouds on Mars using Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the diurnal behavior of lee wave clouds on Mars provides critical insight into the planet's mesoscale atmospheric dynamics and their interaction with surface topography. Lee wave clouds exhibit distinct spatial and temporal patterns that vary over the Martian day. In this study, we investigate the diurnal distribution and frequency of lee wave cloud activity during Martian Year (MY) 36 using observations from the EXI instrument aboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" spacecraft. A total of 50 lee wave events were identified, with a pronounced peak in activity during afternoon hours between solar longitudes (Ls) 270 deg and 360 deg. Our analysis reveals a seasonal and local-time dependence for these clouds, providing a comparative framework with previous mission datasets. These findings not only enhance the current understanding of Martian weather processes but also support future efforts to model and predict terrain-induced cloud dynamics across key locations on Mars.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Solar High-Fidelity Spectroscopy and Precise Radial Velocities from HARPS-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data.
  By analysing all the HARPS-N wavelength solutions over 13 years, we bring to light instrumental systematics at the 1 m/s level. After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time.
  After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s.
  This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.</description>

      <title>An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043. However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</description>

Abstract: Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${&gt;}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.</description>
