      <title>Kepler meets Gaia DR3: homogeneous extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram and binary classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Kepler mission has delivered unprecedented high-quality photometry. These data have impacted numerous research fields (e.g., asteroseismology and exoplanets), and continue to be an astrophysical goldmine. Because of this, thorough investigations of the ~ 200,000 stars observed by Kepler remain of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art characterization of the Kepler targets based on Gaia DR3 data. We place the stars on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), account for the effects of interstellar extinction, and classify targets into several CMD categories (dwarfs, subgiants, red giants, photometric binaries, and others). Additionally, we report various categories of candidate binary systems spanning a range of detection methods, such as Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), radial velocity variables, Gaia non-single stars (NSS), Kepler and Gaia eclipsing binaries from the literature, among others. First and foremost, our work can assist in the selection of stellar and exoplanet host samples regarding CMD and binary populations. We further complement our catalog by quantifying the impact that astrometric differences between Gaia data releases have on CMD location, assessing the contamination in asteroseismic targets with properties at odds with Gaia, and identifying stars flagged as photometrically variable by Gaia. We make our catalog publicly available as a resource to the community when researching the stars observed by Kepler.</description>

      <title>Carbon Stars From Gaia DR3 and the Space Density of Dwarf Carbon Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon stars (with atmospheric C/O$&gt;1$) range widely in temperature and luminosity, from low mass dwarfs to asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). The main sequence dwarf carbon (dC) stars have inherited carbon-rich material from an AGB companion, which has since transitioned to a white dwarf. The dC stars are far more common than C giants, but no reliable estimates of dC space density have been published to date. We present results from an all-sky survey for carbon stars using the low-resolution XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We developed and measured a set of spectral indices contrasting C$_{\rm 2}$ and CN molecular band strengths in carbon stars against common absorption features found in normal (C/O$&lt;1$) stars such as CaI, TiO and Balmer lines. We combined these indices with the XP spectral coefficients as input to supervised machine-learning algorithms trained on a vetted sample of known C stars from LAMOST. We describe the selection of the carbon candidate sample, and provide a catalog of 43,574 candidates dominated by cool C giants in the Magellanic Clouds and at low galactic latitude in the Milky Way. We report the confirmation of candidate C stars using intermediate ($R\sim 1800$) resolution optical spectroscopy from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, and provide estimates of sample purity and completeness. From a carefully-vetted sample of over 600 dCs, we measure their local space density to be $\rho_0\,=\,1.96^{+0.14}_{-0.12}\times10^{-6}\,\text{pc}^{-3}$ (about one dC in every local disk volume of radius 50\,pc), with a relatively large disk scale height of $H_z\,=\,856^{+49}_{-43}\,$pc.</description>

      <title>Discovery of ionized circumstellar gas emission around the long-period Cepheid $\ell$ Carinae with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cepheid circumstellar emissions have previously been detected via both infrared excess and infrared interferometric observations at a few stellar radii. Those studies have shown that these circumstellar emission can be produced by ionized gas, however there is no direct observational evidence to confirm this hypothesis. In this letter we explore the continuum emission and a spectrum of the bright and long-period Cepheid, $\ell$~Car ($P=35.56\,$day) at millimeter-wavelengths in order to detect possible effects of ionized gas emission. We presented ALMA observations of $\ell$ Car in two spectral setups in Band~6 (near 212 and 253\,GHz, respectively) and we compared the measured flux density to one expected for the stellar continuum. We also derived the spectral index and probed the presence of Radio Recombination Lines (RRL). We report statistically significant emission of about 3.5$\,$mJy in the two spectral ranges, which is about 2.5 times the stellar continuum emission. For the first time, we are also able to derive the spectral index of the flux density ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), $\alpha=+1.26\pm$0.44 ($\sim$3$\sigma$ error), which is characteristic of partially optically thick ionized gas emission. Additionally, we discovered an emission line from a RRL of hydrogen H29$\alpha$ centered on the stellar rest velocity, smaller in spatial extent than about 0\farcs2 ($\lesssim 100\,$AU), with a symmetric profile with a width at half power of 55.3$\pm$7.5\,\kms (1$\sigma$ error). It confirms the presence of ionized gas emission near $\ell$~Car. The millimeter emission detected from $\ell$ Car can be attributed to ionized gas emission from the Cepheid's chromosphere. Further radio interferometric observations are necessary to confirm the occurrence of these ionized gas envelopes around Cepheids of different pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ &lt; M$_{\star}$ &lt; 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.</description>

      <title>Testing the Rossby Paradigm: Weakened Magnetic Braking in early K-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an intricate relationship between the organization of large-scale magnetic fields by a stellar dynamo and the rate of angular momentum loss due to magnetized stellar winds. An essential ingredient for the operation of a large-scale dynamo is the Coriolis force, which imprints organizing flows on the global convective patterns and inhibits the complete cancellation of bipolar magnetic regions. Consequently, it is natural to expect a rotational threshold for large-scale dynamo action and for the efficient angular momentum loss that it mediates through magnetic braking. Here we present new observational constraints on magnetic braking for an evolutionary sequence of six early K-type stars. To determine the wind braking torque for each of our targets, we combine spectropolarimetric constraints on the large-scale magnetic field, Ly-alpha or X-ray constraints on the mass-loss rate, as well as uniform estimates of the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. As identified previously from similar observations of hotter stars, we find that the wind braking torque decreases abruptly by more than an order of magnitude at a critical value of the stellar Rossby number. Given that all of the stars in our sample exhibit clear activity cycles, we suggest that weakened magnetic braking may coincide with the operation of a subcritical stellar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Structure of Incomplete Carbon-Oxygen Detonations in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation with reactions terminating either after burning of C$^{12}$ in the leading C$^{12}$ + C$^{12}$ reaction or after burning of C$^{12}$ and O$^{16}$ to Si-group elements may occur in the low-density outer layers of exploding white dwarfs and be responsible for the production of intermediate-mass elements observed in the outer layers of Type Ia supernovae. Basic one-dimensional properties of CO-detonations have been summarized in our previous work. This paper presents the results of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of low-density CO-detonations and discusses their multidimensional stability, cellular structure, and propagation through a constant low-density background. We find three-dimensional CO detonations to be strikingly different from their one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional detonations are significantly more robust and capable of propagating without decay compared to highly unstable and marginal one- and two- dimensional detonations. The detonation cell size and whether burning of C$^{12}$ in a three-dimensional detonation wave is followed by the subsequent O$^{16}$ burning is sensitive to both the background density and the initial C$^{12}$ to O$^{16}$ mass ratio. We also discuss the possible implications for understanding the observed early time bumps in light-curves.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field evolution of X-ray emitting radio-quiet pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields present in neutron stars are closely linked to their observed temperature and spectral characteristics, timing properties, including spin period and its derivatives. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic field evolution is essential for understanding how the strength of the magnetic field change over time. The decay rate of magnetic field in isolated, non-accreting neutron stars can be assessed by evaluating the second derivative of the spin frequency. Another method to estimate this rate involves monitoring an increase in thermal emission beyond what is expected from standard cooling processes, assuming no additional heating mechanisms are present. Our findings indicate that for X-ray emitting isolated neutron stars, the evolution rate of spin period derivative aligns with the dissipation rate of magnetic energy from the dipolar field, provided that a substantial portion of the released energy is emitted as X-rays. The time scale of magnetic field decay is found to be much shorter than typical age of radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.</description>

      <title>The initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era for the study of compact objects. Upcoming detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to add thousands of binary coalescences to the list. However, from a theoretical perspective, our understanding of compact objects is hindered by many uncertainties, and a comprehensive study of the nature of stellar remnants from core-collapse supernovae is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties of stellar remnants using a homogeneous grid of rotating and non-rotating massive stars at various metallicities from Limongi and Chieffi 2018. We simulate the supernova explosion of the evolved progenitors using the HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION (HYPERION) code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020), assuming a thermal bomb model calibrated to match the main properties of SN1987A. We find that the heaviest black hole that can form depends on the initial stellar rotation, metallicity, and the assumed criterion for the onset of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. Non-rotating progenitors at $\big[\rm Fe/H \big]=-3$ can form black holes up to $\sim 87 M_\odot$, falling within the theorized pair-instability mass gap. Conversely, enhanced wind mass loss prevents the formation of BHs more massive than $\sim 41.6 M_\odot$ from rotating progenitors. We use our results to study the black hole mass distribution from a population of $10^6$ isolated massive stars following a Kroupa initial mass function. Finally, we provide fitting formulas to compute the mass of compact remnants as a function of stellar progenitor properties. Our up-to-date prescriptions can be easily implemented in rapid population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Estimate the FUV Flux and a Catalogue for Star-Hosting Discs in Nearby Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at &gt;10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>

Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to MHD turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration is found to be maximal on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around timescale, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These fast acceleration regimes, which are inhomogeneous in space, pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

Abstract: Young low-mass protostars often possess hot corinos, compact, hot and dense regions bright in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs). Besides of their prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the chemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim to explore the iCOMs emission at &lt; 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs (CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO), and derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for each species were derived at 1$\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a non-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram analysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption from foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time unbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot corino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au, with the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au), HCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate of the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission sizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of 20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We observed, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The derived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing and optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or a gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar and circumbinary discs in multiple stellar systems</title>

Abstract: The interplay between stellar multiplicity and protoplanetary discs represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, offering key insights into the processes of planet formation. Protoplanetary discs act as cradles for planetary systems, yet their evolution and capacity to form planets are profoundly affected by gravitational forces within multiple stellar systems. This review synthesises recent advancements in observational and theoretical studies to explore the rich diversity of circumstellar and circumbinary discs within multiple stellar systems. We examine how stellar companions shape disc morphology through truncation, spirals, and misalignment. We also outline how dust dynamics and planetesimal formation are impacted by stellar multiplicity. On top of this, observations at high angular resolution reveal detailed disc structures, while simulations offer key insights into their evolution. Last, we consider the implications of stellar multiplicity for planetary system architectures, emphasising the diversity of planetary outcomes in such environments. Looking ahead, coordinated efforts combining high-resolution observations with advanced numerical models will be critical for unravelling the role of multiple stellar systems in shaping planetary formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Mode identification and ensemble asteroseismology of 119 $\beta$ Cep stars detected by Gaia light curves and monitored by TESS</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission detected many new candidate $\beta$ Cephei ($\beta$ Cep) pulsators, whose variability classification has since been confirmed from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space photometry of the nominal mission. We aim to analyse all currently available TESS data for these $\beta$ Cep pulsators, of which 145 were new discoveries, in order to exploit their asteroseismic potential. Although they are of critical importance to improve evolution models of massive stars, $\beta$ Cep stars are under-represented in the current space photometry revolution. We extracted light curves for 216 stars from TESS full-frame images and performed frequency analysis by means of pre-whitening. Based on Gaia Data Release 3, we deduced stellar properties and compared them to those of known $\beta$ Cep stars from the literature. We developed a methodology to identify the dominant pulsation modes of the $\beta$ Cep stars from the detection of rotationally-split multiplets and Gaia and TESS amplitude ratios. We used grid modelling to gain insights into the population of $\beta$ Cep stars. Combining TESS and Gaia, we successfully identified the mode degrees for 148 stars in our sample. We find the majority to have a dominant dipole non-radial mode. Many non-radial modes show splittings in their TESS frequency spectra, which we use to calculate their envelope rotation, spin parameter, and the level of differential envelope-to-surface rotation (upper limit of about 3). We also provide relative frequency asymmetries within the multiplets, ranging from -0.15 to 0.15 with most being positive. Based on grid modelling, we provide mass, convective core mass, and age distributions for 119 stars. Our study prepares for future detailed modelling based on individual frequencies of identified modes leading towards a better understanding of these massive pulsators. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent far-infrared polarization of HL Tau observed with SOFIA/HAWC+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>
