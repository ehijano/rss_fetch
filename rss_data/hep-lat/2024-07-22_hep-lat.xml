      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quantum Simulation Algorithms for Scalar Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide practical simulation methods for scalar field theories on a quantum computer that yield improved asymptotics as well as concrete gate estimates for the simulation and physical qubit estimates using the surface code. We achieve these improvements through two optimizations. First, we consider a different approach for estimating the elements of the S-matrix. This approach is appropriate in general for 1+1D and for certain low-energy elastic collisions in higher dimensions. Second, we implement our approach using a series of different fault-tolerant simulation algorithms for Hamiltonians formulated both in the field occupation basis and field amplitude basis. Our algorithms are based on either second-order Trotterization or qubitization. The cost of Trotterization in occupation basis scales as $\widetilde{O}(\lambda N^7 |\Omega|^3/(M^{5/2} \epsilon^{3/2})$ where $\lambda$ is the coupling strength, $N$ is the occupation cutoff $|\Omega|$ is the volume of the spatial lattice, $M$ is the mass of the particles and $\epsilon$ is the uncertainty in the energy calculation used for the $S$-matrix determination. Qubitization in the field basis scales as $\widetilde{O}(|\Omega|^2 (k^2 \Lambda +kM^2)/\epsilon)$ where $k$ is the cutoff in the field and $\Lambda$ is a scaled coupling constant. We find in both cases that the bounds suggest physically meaningful simulations can be performed using on the order of $4\times 10^6$ physical qubits and $10^{12}$ $T$-gates which corresponds to roughly one day on a superconducting quantum computer with surface code and a cycle time of 100 ns, placing simulation of scalar field theory within striking distance of the gate counts for the best available chemistry simulation results.</description>

      <title>Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) for Adiabatic State Preparation and Time Evolution in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane for varying pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of a varying pion mass on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field, aiming to understand it using Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio like effective models. We compare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we find that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated with increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature with increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to $440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results found by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in the models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling constant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it enables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without introducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement depends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In this respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation, automatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the physics more naturally.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>Masses of magnetized pseudoscalar and vector mesons in an extended NJL model: the role of axial vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectrum of light pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field $\vec B$, considering the effects of the mixing with the axial vector meson sector. The analysis is performed within a two-flavor NJL-like model which includes isoscalar and isovector couplings together with a flavor mixing 't Hooft-like term. The effect of the magnetic field on charged particles is taken into account by retaining the Schwinger phases carried by quark propagators, and expanding the corresponding meson fields in proper Ritus-like bases. The spin-isospin and spin-flavor decomposition of meson mass states is also analyzed. For neutral pion masses it is shown that the mixing with axial vector mesons improves previous theoretical results, leading to a monotonic decreasing behavior with $B$ that is in good qualitative agreement with LQCD calculations, both for the case of constant or $B$-dependent couplings. Regarding charged pions, it is seen that the mixing softens the enhancement of their mass with $B$. As a consequence, the energy becomes lower than the one corresponding to a pointlike pion, improving the agreement with LQCD results. The agreement is also improved for the magnetic behavior of the lowest $\rho^+$ energy state, which does not vanish for the considered range of values of $B$ -- a fact that can be relevant in connection with the occurrence of meson condensation for strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Optimised observables and new physics prospects in the penguin-mediated decays $B_{d(s)}\to K^{(*)0}\phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study penguin-mediated $\bar{B}_{d(s)}\to\bar{K}^{*0}(K^{*0})\phi$ transitions, proposing a new optimised observable $L_{K^*\phi}$ from the ratio of the corresponding branching ratios of these decays, with limited hadronic uncertainties and enhanced New Physics sensitivity. It deviates by $1.48\sigma$ between its experimental value and SM determination within QCD factorisation. This can be accommodated together with significant deviations found in the $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ modes in our earlier works if New Physics affects either the QCD penguin operator $Q_4$ or the chromomagnetic dipole operator $Q_{8g}$ for both $b\to d$ and $b\to s$ transitions. The allowed range for the Wilson coefficients $C_{4s,8gs}$ is narrower than $C_{4d,8gd}$ since the $b\to s$ transition channel $\bar{B}_d\to\bar{K}^{*0}\phi$ is in better agreement with the SM. However, if we add the measured $\bar{B}_{d}\to \bar{K}^{0}\phi$ branching ratio, simultaneous explanation of all experimental data for $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $K^*(\bar{K}^{(*)})\phi$ channels in terms of New Physics in $C_{4d,s}$ or $C_{8gd,s}$ only, is not possible. They can be explained more easily if we assume New Physics in both $f=d,s$ sectors. The addition of the branching ratios of the charged modes $B^-\to K^{(*)-}\phi$ to the above mix of observables results in a reduction of the parameter space for the $(C_{4f},C_{6f})$ scenario, while discarding the $(C_{6f},C_{8gf})$ scenario completely. This is because of the discrepancy of more than 1 $\sigma$ between the experimental measurements of the branching ratios of the $\bar{B}_{d}(B^-)\to\bar{K}^0(K^-)\phi$ transitions. This provides a strong incentive for the LHCb/Belle II experiments to measure the branching ratios of $\bar{B}_{d}\to\bar{K}^{(*)0}\phi$, $\bar{B}_s\to K^{*0}\phi$ and particularly $B^-\to K^-\phi$ to confirm or dismiss the conclusions hinted at by present data.</description>
