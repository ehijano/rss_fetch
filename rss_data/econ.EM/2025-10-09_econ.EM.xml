      <title>Bayesian Portfolio Optimization by Predictive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a critical task in investment. Most existing portfolio optimization methods require information on the distribution of returns of the assets that make up the portfolio. However, such distribution information is usually unknown to investors. Various methods have been proposed to estimate distribution information, but their accuracy greatly depends on the uncertainty of the financial markets. Due to this uncertainty, a model that could well predict the distribution information at one point in time may perform less accurately compared to another model at a different time. To solve this problem, we investigate a method for portfolio optimization based on Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS), one of the Bayesian ensemble methods for meta-learning. We assume that investors have access to multiple asset return prediction models. By using BPS with dynamic linear models to combine these predictions, we can obtain a Bayesian predictive posterior about the mean rewards of assets that accommodate the uncertainty of the financial markets. In this study, we examine how to construct mean-variance portfolios and quantile-based portfolios based on the predicted distribution information.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Oracle Property: Adaptive LASSO in Cointegrating Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new asymptotic results for the adaptive LASSO estimator in cointegrating regression models. We study model selection probabilities, estimator consistency, and limiting distributions under both standard and moving-parameter asymptotics. We also derive uniform convergence rates and the fastest local-to-zero rates that can still be detected by the estimator, complementing and extending the results of Lee, Shi, and Gao (2022, Journal of Econometrics, 229, 322--349). Our main findings include that under conservative tuning, the adaptive LASSO estimator is uniformly $T$-consistent and the cut-off rate for local-to-zero coefficients that can be detected by the procedure is $1/T$. Under consistent tuning, however, both rates are slower and depend on the tuning parameter. The theoretical results are complemented by a detailed simulation study showing that the finite-sample distribution of the adaptive LASSO estimator deviates substantially from what is suggested by the oracle property, whereas the limiting distributions derived under moving-parameter asymptotics provide much more accurate approximations. Finally, we show that our results also extend to models with local-to-unit-root regressors and to predictive regressions with unit-root predictors.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Dynamic Games with Unknown Information Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03706v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an empirical framework for analyzing dynamic games when the underlying information structure is unknown to the analyst. We introduce \textit{Markov correlated equilibrium}, a dynamic analog of Bayes correlated equilibrium, and show that its predictions coincide with the Markov perfect equilibrium predictions attainable when players observe richer signals than the analyst assumes. We provide tractable methods for informationally robust estimation, inference, and counterfactual analysis. We illustrate the framework with a dynamic entry game between Starbucks and Dunkin' in the US and study the role of informational assumptions.</description>

      <title>Debiased Machine Learning U-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to debias estimators based on U-statistics with Machine Learning (ML) first-steps. Standard plug-in estimators often suffer from regularization and model-selection biases, producing invalid inferences. We show that Debiased Machine Learning (DML) estimators can be constructed within a U-statistics framework to correct these biases while preserving desirable statistical properties. The approach delivers simple, robust estimators with provable asymptotic normality and good finite-sample performance. We apply our method to three problems: inference on Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) using the Gini coefficient of ML-predicted incomes given circumstances, inference on predictive accuracy via the Area Under the Curve (AUC), and inference on linear models with ML-based sample-selection corrections. Using European survey data, we present the first debiased estimates of income IOp. In our empirical application, commonly employed ML-based plug-in estimators systematically underestimate IOp, while our debiased estimators are robust across ML methods.</description>

      <title>Inference in clustered IV models with many and weak instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data clustering reduces the effective sample size from the number of observations towards the number of clusters. For instrumental variable models this reduced effective sample size makes the instruments more likely to be weak, in the sense that they contain little information about the endogenous regressor, and many, in the sense that their number is large compared to the sample size. Consequently, weak and many instrument problems for estimators and tests in instrumental variable models are also more likely. None of the previously developed many and weak instrument robust tests, however, can be applied to clustered data as they all require independent observations. Therefore, I adapt the many and weak instrument robust jackknife Anderson--Rubin and jackknife score tests to clustered data by removing clusters rather than individual observations from the statistics. Simulations and a revisitation of a study on the effect of queenly reign on war show the empirical relevance of the new tests.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Diagnostic Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of the assumptions underlying classical (Gaussian) limit theory often yields unreliable statistical inference. This paper shows that the bootstrap can detect such violations by delivering simple and powerful diagnostic tests that (a) induce no pre-testing bias, (b) use the same critical values across applications, and (c) are consistent against deviations from asymptotic normality. The tests compare the conditional distribution of a bootstrap statistic with the Gaussian limit implied by valid specification and assess whether the resulting discrepancy is large enough to indicate failure of the asymptotic Gaussian approximation. The method is computationally straightforward and only requires a sample of i.i.d. draws of the bootstrap statistic. We derive sufficient conditions for the randomness in the data to mix with the randomness in the bootstrap repetitions in a way such that (a), (b) and (c) above hold. We demonstrate the practical relevance and broad applicability of bootstrap diagnostics by considering several scenarios where the asymptotic Gaussian approximation may fail, including weak instruments, non-stationarity, parameters on the boundary of the parameter space, infinite variance data and singular Jacobian in applications of the delta method. An illustration drawn from the empirical macroeconomic literature concludes.</description>

      <title>Automatic Order, Bandwidth Selection and Flaws of Eigen Adjustment in HAC Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimator based on the prewhitened kernel estimator and a localized leave-one-out frequency domain cross-validation (FDCV). We adapt the cross-validated log likelihood (CVLL) function to simultaneously select the order of the prewhitening vector autoregression (VAR) and the bandwidth. The prewhitening VAR is estimated by the Burg method without eigen adjustment as we find the eigen adjustment rule of Andrews and Monahan (1992) can be triggered unnecessarily and harmfully when regressors have nonzero mean. Through Monte Carlo simulations and three empirical examples, we illustrate the flaws of eigen adjustment and the reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Identification in Auctions with Truncated Transaction Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I establish nonparametric identification results in first- and second-price auctions when transaction prices are truncated by a binding reserve price under a range of information structures. When the number of potential bidders is fixed and known across all auctions, if only the transaction price is observed, the bidders' private-value distribution is identified in second-price auctions but not in first-price auctions. Identification in first-price auctions can be achieved if either the number of active bidders or the number of auctions with no sales is observed. When the number of potential bidders varies across auctions and is unknown, the bidders' private-value distribution is identified in first-price auctions but not in second-price auctions, provided that both the transaction price and the number of active bidders are observed. I derive analogous results to auctions with entry costs, which face a similar truncation issue when data on potential bidders who do not enter are missing.</description>

      <title>Returns and Order Flow Imbalances: Intraday Dynamics and Macroeconomic News Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances in the S&amp;P 500 E-mini futures market using a structural VAR model identified through heteroskedasticity. The model is estimated at one-second frequency for each 15-minute interval, capturing both intraday variation and endogeneity due to time aggregation. We find that macroeconomic news announcements sharply reshape price-flow dynamics: price impact rises, flow impact declines, return volatility spikes, and flow volatility falls. Pooling across days, both price and flow impacts are significant at the one-second horizon, with estimates broadly consistent with stylized limit-order-book predictions. Impulse responses indicate that shocks dissipate almost entirely within a second. Structural parameters and volatilities also exhibit pronounced intraday variation tied to liquidity, trading intensity, and spreads. These results provide new evidence on high-frequency price formation and liquidity, highlighting the role of public information and order submission in shaping market quality.</description>
