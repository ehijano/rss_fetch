      <title>Scaling Graph Neural Networks to Large Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) architectures have emerged as promising force field models, exhibiting high accuracy in predicting complex energies and forces based on atomic identities and Cartesian coordinates. To expand the applicability of GNNs, and machine learning force fields more broadly, optimizing their computational efficiency is critical, especially for large biomolecular systems in classical molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, we address key challenges in existing GNN benchmarks by introducing a dataset, DISPEF, which comprises large, biologically relevant proteins. DISPEF includes 207,454 proteins with sizes up to 12,499 atoms and features diverse chemical environments, spanning folded and disordered regions. The implicit solvation free energies, used as training targets, represent a particularly challenging case due to their many-body nature, providing a stringent test for evaluating the expressiveness of machine learning models. We benchmark the performance of seven GNNs on DISPEF, emphasizing the importance of directly accounting for long-range interactions to enhance model transferability. Additionally, we present a novel multiscale architecture, termed Schake, which delivers transferable and computationally efficient energy and force predictions for large proteins. Our findings offer valuable insights and tools for advancing GNNs in protein modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Adsorption and permeation events in molecular diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many times a diffusing molecule can permeate across a membrane or be adsorbed on a substrate? We employ the encounter-based approach to find the statistics of adsorption or permeation events for molecular diffusion in a general confining medium. Various features of these statistics are illustrated for two practically relevant cases of a flat boundary and a spherical confinement. Some applications of these fundamental results are discussed.</description>

      <title>dZiner: Rational Inverse Design of Materials with AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence, fueled by scientific data, are revolutionizing the discovery of new materials. Despite the wealth of existing scientific literature, the availability of both structured experimental data and chemical domain knowledge that can be easily integrated into data-driven workflows is limited. The motivation to integrate this information, as well as additional context from first-principle calculations and physics-informed deep learning surrogate models, is to enable efficient exploration of the relevant chemical space and to predict structure-property relationships of new materials a priori. Ultimately, such a framework could replicate the expertise of human subject-matter experts. In this work, we present dZiner, a chemist AI agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), that discovers new compounds with desired properties via inverse design (property-to-structure). In specific, the agent leverages domain-specific insights from foundational scientific literature to propose new materials with enhanced chemical properties, iteratively evaluating them using relevant surrogate models in a rational design process, while accounting for design constraints. The model supports both closed-loop and human-in-the-loop feedback cycles, enabling human-AI collaboration in molecular design with real-time property inference, and uncertainty and chemical feasibility assessment. We demonstrate the flexibility of this agent by applying it to various materials target properties, including surfactants, ligand and drug candidates, and metal-organic frameworks. Our approach holds promise to both accelerate the discovery of new materials and enable the targeted design of materials with desired functionalities. The methodology is available as an open-source software on https://github.com/mehradans92/dZiner.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.12\pm 0.09$ and $-4.97\pm 0.06~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.6\pm 0.2$ and $-4.4\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</description>

      <title>Milestoning network refinement by incorporating experimental thermodynamic and kinetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milestoning is an accurate and efficient method for rare event kinetics calculations by constructing a continuous-time kinetic network connecting the reactant and product states. However, even with adequate sampling, its accuracy can also be limited by the force fields, which makes it challenging to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental data. To address this issue, we present a refinement approach by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between two Milestoning networks while incorporating experimental thermodynamic (equilibrium constants) and kinetic (rate constants) data as constraints. This approach ensures that the refined kinetic network is minimally perturbed with respect to the original one, while simultaneously satisfying the experimental constraints. The refinement approach is demonstrated using the binding and unbinding dynamics of a series of six small molecule ligands for the model host system, $\beta$-cyclodextrin.</description>

      <title>Model for Predicting Adsorption Isotherms and the Kinetics of Adsorption via Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work outlines the foundations for being able to do a first-principle study of the adsorption process using the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework, a framework able to predict the unique non-equilibrium path taken by a system from some initial state to stable equilibrium. To account for the process of multi-component adsorption, the SEAQT framework incorporates the particle number operator for each absorbed species directly into its equation of motion. The theoretical models developed are validated via some initial comparisons with experimental data found in the literature, demonstrating good agreement. The findings reveal that this framework can be an effective tool for describing the adsorption process out of equilibrium. It is able to do so without $a \; priori$ knowledge of the specific adsorption mechanism(s) involved. It also aligns well with the anticipated predictions of equilibrium models. In addition, within this framework, all intensive thermodynamic properties are characterized by out-of-equilibrium fluctuations, highlighting the significance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in predicting measurable physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Machine Learning Electron Density and Its Response in Real Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron density is a fundamental quantity, which can in principle determine all ground state electronic properties of a given system. Although machine learning (ML) models for electron density based on either an atom-centered basis or a real-space grid have been proposed, the demand for the number of high-order basis functions or grid points is enormous. In this work, we propose an efficient grid-point sampling strategy that combines a targeted sampling favoring large density and a screening of grid points associated with linearly independent atomic features. This new sampling strategy is integrated with a field-induced recursively embedded atom neural network model to develop a real-space grid-based ML model for electron density and its response to an electric field. This approach is applied to a QM9 molecular dataset, a H2O/Pt(111) interfacial system, and an Au(100) electrode under an electric field. The number of training points is found much smaller than previous models, when yielding comparably accurate predictions for the electron density of the entire grid. The resultant machine learned electron density model enables us to properly partition partial charge onto each atom and analyze the charge variation upon proton transfer in the H2O/Pt(111) system. The machined learned electronic response model allows us to predict charge transfer and the electrostatic potential change induced by an electric field in an Au(100) electrode.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Driven Charge Migration Triggered by Infrared Multi-Photon Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of observing correlation-driven charge migration has been a driving force behind theoretical and experimental developments in the field of attosecond molecular science since its inception. Despite significant accomplishments, the unambiguous experimental observation of this quantum beating remains elusive. In this work, we present a method to selectively trigger such dynamics using molecules predicted to exhibit long-lived electron coherence. We show that these dynamics can be selectively triggered using infrared multi-photon ionization and probed using the spacial resolution of X-ray free-electron laser, proposing a promising experimental scheme to study these pivotal dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate that real-time time-dependent density-functional theory can describe correlation-driven charge migration resulting from a hole mixing structure involving the HOMO of a molecule.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.</description>

      <title>Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Framework for Predicting Arsenic Adsorption on Graphene Oxide Surfaces -- A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) framework is employed to describe the adsorption process of arsenic (V) onto graphene oxide both in and out of equilibrium. The steepest-entropy-ascent principle is used to derive a non-equilibrium equation of motion applicable to a system composed of five species: water, arsenic, two functional groups of graphene oxide, and hydrogen ions. The equation of motion is solved using the system's energy eigenstructure. This eigenstructure is constructed with the Replica-Exchange Wang-Landau algorithm and used to train an artificial neural network that predicts the energy eigenstructure for dilute arsenic concentrations in the range of groundwater contamination. For a specified initial pH and specified initial concentrations of Ar and graphene oxide, the framework predicts arsenic adsorption capacity and the stable equilibrium arsenic concentration. Equilibrium results match well with equilibrium experimental data, demonstrating the efficacy of this framework for describing the adsorption process. Finally, the model is used to predict non-equilibrium adsorption behavior and the influence of solution pH upon arsenic removal efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with targeted properties is crucial in biology, chemistry, and drug discovery. Current generative models are limited to using single property values as conditions, struggling with complex customizations described in detailed human language. To address this, we propose the text guidance instead, and introduce TextSMOG, a new Text-guided Small Molecule Generation Approach via 3D Diffusion Model which integrates language and diffusion models for text-guided small molecule generation. This method uses textual conditions to guide molecule generation, enhancing both stability and diversity. Experimental results show TextSMOG's proficiency in capturing and utilizing information from textual descriptions, making it a powerful tool for generating 3D molecular structures in response to complex textual customizations.</description>

      <title>Triplet Exciton Sensitization of Silicon Mediated by Defect States in Hafnium Oxynitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet exciton fission has the potential to increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells beyond the conventional single junction limit. Perhaps the largest obstacle to achieving this enhancement is uncertainty about energy coupling mechanisms at the interfaces between silicon and exciton fission materials such as tetracene. Here, the previously reported silicon-hafnium oxynitride-tetracene structure is studied and a combination of magnetic-field-dependent silicon photoluminescence measurements and density functional theory calculations is used to probe the influence of the interlayer composition on the triplet transfer process across the hafnium oxynitride interlayer. It is found that hafnium oxide interlayers do not show triplet exciton sensitization of silicon, and that nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band-edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process. Some defects introduce additional deleterious mid-gap states, which may explain observed silicon photoluminescence quenching. These results show that band-edge states can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process, potentially through a sequential charge transfer mechanism.</description>

      <title>Neutral polymer conformations with attractive bridging crowder interactions: role of crowder size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive crowders of varying sizes. For weakly self-attractive polymers, larger crowders induce a transition from an extended state to a bridging-crowder-induced collapse (CB phase) at lower polymer-crowder interaction strengths. Similarly, for strongly self-attractive polymers, a transition from a crowder-excluded collapse (CI phase) to the CB phase occurs with larger crowders and stronger polymer-crowder attraction. The simulations reveal that the collapsed states in both weakly and strongly self-attractive polymers are identical when small bridging crowders are involved. Near the transition threshold for weakly self-attractive polymers, increasing crowder size leads to complex transitions, including collapse, extension, and re-collapse. Additionally, a confined collapse (CC phase) is observed, where the polymer is confined to interstitial spaces among large crowders. Strongly self-attractive polymers show similar transitions, but only with smaller crowders, as larger crowders suppress these changes. These findings underscore the crucial influence of crowder size on the conformational behavior of neutral polymers, especially under varying degrees of polymer-crowder interaction.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Models for Inverse Molecular Design with Retrosynthetic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have integrated images, adapting them to graphs remains challenging, limiting their applications in materials and drug design. This difficulty stems from the need for coherent autoregressive generation across texts and graphs. To address this, we introduce Llamole, the first multimodal LLM capable of interleaved text and graph generation, enabling molecular inverse design with retrosynthetic planning. Llamole integrates a base LLM with the Graph Diffusion Transformer and Graph Neural Networks for multi-conditional molecular generation and reaction inference within texts, while the LLM, with enhanced molecular understanding, flexibly controls activation among the different graph modules. Additionally, Llamole integrates A* search with LLM-based cost functions for efficient retrosynthetic planning. We create benchmarking datasets and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate Llamole against in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Llamole significantly outperforms 14 adapted LLMs across 12 metrics for controllable molecular design and retrosynthetic planning.</description>

Abstract: Although recent advances in simulating open quantum systems have lead to significant progress, the applicability of numerically exact methods is still restricted to rather small systems. Hence, more approximate methods remain relevant due to their computational efficiency, enabling simulations of larger systems over extended timescales. In this study, we present advances for one such method, namely the Numerical Integration of Schr\"odinger Equation (NISE). Firstly, we introduce a modified ensemble-averaging procedure that improves the long-time behavior of the thermalized variant of the NISE scheme, termed Thermalized NISE. Secondly, we demonstrate how to use the NISE in conjunction with (highly) structured spectral densities by utilizing a noise generating algorithm for arbitrary structured noise. This algorithm also serves as a tool for establishing best practices in determining spectral densities from excited state calculations along molecular dynamics or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics trajectories. Finally, we assess the ability of the NISE approach to calculate absorption spectra and demonstrate the utility of the proposed modifications by determining population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Combining Hammett $\sigma$ constants for $\Delta$-machine learning and catalyst discovery</title>

Abstract: We study the applicability of the Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz to model relative substrate binding within homogenous organometallic catalysis, assigning $\sigma$ and $\rho$ to ligands and metals, respectively. Implementing an additive combination (c) rule for obtaining $\sigma$ constants for any ligand pair combination results in a cHIP model that enhances data efficiency in computational ligand tuning. We show its usefulness (i) as a baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning (ML), and (ii) to identify novel catalyst candidates via volcano plots. After testing the combination rule on Hammett constants previously published in the literature, we have generated numerical evidence for the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) C-C cross-coupling reaction using two synthetic datasets of metallic catalysts (including (10) and (11)-metals Ni, Pd, Pt, and Cu, Ag, Au as well as 96 ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes, phosphines, or pyridines). When used as a baseline, $\Delta$-ML prediction errors of relative binding decrease systematically with training set size and reach chemical accuracy ($\sim$1 kcal/mol) for 20k training instances. Employing the individual ligand constants obtained from cHIP, we report relative substrate binding for a novel dataset consisting of 720 catalysts (not part of training data), of which 145 fall into the most promising range on the volcano plot accounting for oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination steps. Multiple Ni-based catalysts, e.g. Aphos-Ni-P($t$-Bu)$_3$, are included among these promising candidates, potentially offering dramatic cost savings in experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation, we propose to embed a quantum computing ansatz into density-functional theory via density-based basis-set corrections (DBBSC) to obtain quantitative quantum-chemistry results on molecules that would otherwise require brute-force quantum calculations using hundreds of logical qubits. Indeed, accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources is an essential challenge given the limited qubit capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards chemically accurate quantum computations by approaching the complete-basis-set limit through coupling the DBBSC approach, applied to any given variational ansatz, to an on-the-fly crafting of basis sets specifically adapted to a given system and user-defined qubit budget. The resulting approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties (e.g. dipole moments), but can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations with expected applications in drug design and materials science.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pseudo-Jahn-Teller Activity on the Singlet-Triplet Gap of Azaphenalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of symmetry-lowering induced by pseudo-Jahn--Teller interactions in six previously studied azaphenalenes that are known to have their first excited singlet state (S$_1$) lower in energy than the triplet state (T$_1$). The primary aim of this study is to explore whether Hund's rule violation is observed in these molecules when their structures are distorted from $C_{\rm 2v}$ or $D_{\rm 3h}$ point group symmetries by vibronic coupling. Along two interatomic distances connecting these point groups to their subgroups $C_{\rm s}$ or $C_{\rm 3h}$, we relaxed the other internal degrees of freedom and calculated two-dimensional potential energy subsurfaces. The many-body perturbation theory (MP2) suggests that the high-symmetry structures are the energy minima for all six systems. However, single-point energy calculations using the coupled-cluster method (CCSD(T)) indicate symmetry lowering in four cases. The singlet-triplet energy gap plotted on the potential energy surface also shows variations when deviating from high-symmetry structures. A full geometry optimization at the CCSD(T) level with the cc-pVTZ basis set reveals that the $D_{\rm 3h}$ structure of cyclazine (1AP) is a saddle point, connecting two equivalent minima of $C_{\rm 3h}$ symmetry undergoing rapid automerization. The combined effects of symmetry lowering and high-level corrections result in a nearly zero singlet-triplet gap for the $C_{\rm 3h}$ structure of cyclazine. Azaphenalenes containing nitrogen atoms at electron-deficient sites -- 2AP, 3AP, and 4AP -- exhibit more pronounced in-plane structural distortion; the effect is captured by the long-range exchange-interaction corrected DFT method, $\omega$B97XD. Excited state calculations of these systems indicate that in their low-symmetry energy minima, T$_1$ is indeed lower in energy than S$_1$, upholding the validity of Hund's rule.</description>

Abstract: In theory, two extreme forms of substances exist:the pure form and the single-molecule mixture form. The latter contains a mixture of molecules with molecularly different structures.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines model construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting results.(Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024,25,7571.) In this preprint,a detailed discussion of the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Including photoexcitation explicitly in trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics at no cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decades, theoretical photochemistry has produced multiple techniques to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules. Surprisingly, much less effort has been devoted to adequately describing the first step of a photochemical or photophysical process: photoexcitation. Here, we propose a formalism to include the effect of a laser pulse in trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics at the level of the initial conditions, with no additional cost. The promoted density approach (PDA) decouples the excitation from the nonadiabatic dynamics by defining a new set of initial conditions, which include an excitation time. PDA with surface hopping leads to nonadiabatic dynamics simulations in excellent agreement with quantum dynamics using an explicit laser pulse and highlights the strong impact of a laser pulse on the resulting photodynamics and the limits of the (sudden) vertical excitation. Combining PDA with trajectory-based nonadiabatic methods is possible for any arbitrary-sized molecules using a code provided in this work.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Microscopic Origins in Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Based on Rigorous Atomic Space Tessellating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the contribution of various atoms and structural units formed in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials to macroscopic optical response is crucial for NLO crystal design. In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly to the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.</description>
