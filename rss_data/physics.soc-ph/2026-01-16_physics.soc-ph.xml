      <title>Nested hyperedges promote the onset of collective transitions but suppress explosive behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions can dramatically reshape collective dynamics, yet how their microscopic organization controls macroscopic critical behavior remains unclear. Here we develop a new theory to study contagion dynamics on hypergraphs and show that nested hyperedges not only facilitate the onset of spreading, but also suppress backward bifurcations, thereby inhibiting explosive behavior. By disentangling contagion pathways, we find that overlap redirects transmission from external links to internal, group-embedded routes -- boosting early activation but making dyadic and triadic channels increasingly redundant. This loss of structural independence quenches the nonlinear amplification required for bistability, progressively smoothing the transition as hyperedges become nested. We observe the same phenomenology in Kuramoto dynamics, pointing to a broadly universal mechanism by which nested higher-order structure governs critical transitions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Transforming Crises into Opportunities: From Chaos to Urban Antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban crises - floods, pandemics, economic shocks, and conflicts - function as accelerators of urban change, exposing structural vulnerabilities while creating windows for reinvention. Building on a prior theoretical contribution that identified fifteen principles of urban antifragility, this paper tests and operationalizes the framework through an empirical assessment of 26 cities selected for their post-crisis adaptation trajectories. Using a tailored diagnostic methodology, we benchmark cities' Stress Response Strategies (SRS) and then evaluate Urban Development Trajectories (UDT) across four weighted dimensions, positioning each case along a fragility-robustness-resilience-antifragility continuum and applying a balanced-threshold rule to confirm antifragile status. Results show that "resilience enhanced by innovation and technology" is the most effective response typology (86.9/100), and that six cities meet the antifragile trajectory criteria. By mapping best practices to activated principles and analysing co-activations, the study identifies a robust "hard core" of principles - Sustainable Resilience (O), Strategic Diversity (F), Proactive Innovation (I), and Active Prevention (N) - supplemented by operational enablers (e.g., anticipation, mobilization, shock absorption). The paper concludes by proposing an evidence-based, SDG-aligned operational model that links high-impact principle pairings to measurable indicators, offering a practical roadmap for cities seeking to convert crises into sustained transformation. Keywords: Post-crisis strategies, Urban antifragility, Sustainable cities and communities, Disaster resilience and urban regeneration, Risk governance and Black Swan adaptation.</description>

      <title>The hidden structure of innovation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovation emerges from complex collaboration patterns - among inventors, firms, or institutions. However, not much is known about the overall mesoscopic structure around which inventive activity self-organizes. Here, we tackle this problem by employing patent data to analyze both individual (\emph{co-inventorship}) and organization (\emph{co-ownership}) networks in three strategic domains (\emph{artificial intelligence}, \emph{biotechnology} and \emph{semiconductors}). We characterize the mesoscale structure (in terms of clusters) of each domain by comparing two alternative methods: a standard baseline - modularity maximization - and one based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion, within the Stochastic Block Model and its degree-corrected variant. We find that, across sectors, inventor networks are denser and more clustered than organization ones - consistent with the presence of small recurrent teams embedded into broader institutional hierarchies - whereas organization networks have neater hierarchical role-based structures, with few bridging firms coordinating the most peripheral ones. We also find that the discovered meso-structures are connected to innovation output. In particular, Lorenz curves of forward citations show a pervasive inequality in technological influence: across sectors and methods, both inventor (especially) and organization networks consistently show high levels of concentration of citations in a few of the discovered clusters. Our results demonstrate that the baseline modularity-based method may not be capable of fully capturing the way collaborations drive the spreading of inventive impact across technological domains. This is due to the presence of local hierarchies that call for more refined tools based on Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic Optimal Surveillance for Epidemic Prevalence in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the true prevalence of an epidemic outbreak is a key public health problem. This is challenging because surveillance is usually resource intensive and biased. In the network setting, prior work on cost sensitive disease surveillance has focused on choosing a subset of individuals (or nodes) to minimize objectives such as probability of outbreak detection. Such methods do not give insights into the outbreak size distribution which, despite being complex and multi-modal, is very useful in public health planning. We introduce TESTPREV, a problem of choosing a subset of nodes which maximizes the mutual information with disease prevalence, which directly provides information about the outbreak size distribution. We show that, under the independent cascade (IC) model, solutions computed by all prior disease surveillance approaches are highly sub-optimal for TESTPREV in general. We also show that TESTPREV is hard to even approximate. While this mutual information objective is computationally challenging for general networks, we show that it can be computed efficiently for various network classes. We present a greedy strategy, called GREEDYMI, that uses estimates of mutual information from cascade simulations and thus can be applied on any network and disease model. We find that GREEDYMI does better than natural baselines in terms of maximizing the mutual information as well as reducing the expected variance in outbreak size, under the IC model.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>
