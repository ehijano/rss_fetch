      <title>Generalizing Multimorbidity Models Across Countries: A Comparative Study of Austria and Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic diseases frequently co-occur in patterns that are unlikely to arise by chance, a phenomenon known as multimorbidity. This growing challenge for patients and healthcare systems is amplified by demographic aging and the rising burden of chronic conditions. However, our understanding of how individuals transition from a disease-free-state to accumulating diseases as they age is limited. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed to characterize morbidity trajectories using electronic health records; however, their generalizability across healthcare settings remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a cross-country validation of a data-driven multimorbidity trajectory model using population-wide health data from Denmark and Austria. Despite considerable differences in healthcare organization, we observe a high degree of similarity in disease cluster structures. The Adjusted Rand Index (0.998) and the Normalized Mutual Information (0.88) both indicate strong alignment between the two clusterings. These findings suggest that multimorbidity trajectories are shaped by robust, shared biological and epidemiological mechanisms that transcend national healthcare contexts.</description>

      <title>Combining Blotto Networks and Voter Models to Simulate Voter Behavior in Response to Competitive Election Spending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, the Voter Model has been explicitly used to model the impact of propaganda on a dynamic, interconnected population, and certain factors have been identified that influence the behavior of voters when under outside influence. The Blotto Game has also been explicitly used to study information wars between two opposing parties, whether in regards to a political issue or advertising war. Both the graph theory behind the Voter Model and the game theory aspects of the Blotto Game are relevant to the behavior of voters or consumers when they are under the influence of competing propaganda campaigns, and for this reason both are useful to understand the most effective spending strategy. In this project, we seek to combine the two problems into a Voter-Blotto Game and examine what components of the graph most effect its value in the eyes of the competing players.</description>

      <title>How the coupling of green finance and green technology innovation affect synergistic effect of pollution and emission carbon reduction: evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid China's dual-carbon transition, the synergistic alignment of green finance with green-technology innovation is pivotal for co-controlling pollution and CO2 emissions. Using panel data for 266 Chinese prefecture-level cities over 2007-2023, We construct the coupling coordination index system of green finance and green technology innovation via a coupling-coordination model and systematically analyzes influencing mechanism of synergistic effect of pollution and carbon reduction. Four findings emerge.(1) The coupled-coordination significantly enhances the synergy, and energy efficiency plays a partial intermediary role in the relationship between the two.(2) The effect is heterogeneous: pronounced in the eastern and western regions, negligible in the central region, and stronger in non-resource-based and non-Yangtze River Basin cities.(3) A double-threshold model reveals a non-linear strengthening pattern as green-finance depth increases.(4) Spatial Durbin estimates show positive spillovers: the coupling of green finance and green technology innovation not only improves the level of local coordination, but also drives the improvement of environmental performance in adjacent areas. These results provide quantitative guidance for allocating green-finance resources, elevating green-innovation efficiency, and designing regionally coordinated mitigation policies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cellular Automata for Real-Time Wildfire Spread Modeling in California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating, and therefore the technology to combat them must adapt accordingly. Modern predictive models have failed to balance predictive accuracy and operational viability, resulting in consistently delayed or misinformed fire suppression and public safety efforts. The present study addresses this gap by developing and validating a predictive model based on cellular automata (CA) that incorporates key environmental variables, including vegetation density (NDVI), wind speed and direction, and topographic slope derived from open-access datasets. The presented CA framework offers a lightweight alternative to data-heavy approaches that fail in emergency contexts. Evaluation of the model using a confusion matrix against burn scars from the 2025 Pacific Palisades Fire yielded a recall of 0.860, a precision of 0.605, and an overall F1 score of 0.711 after 50 parameter optimization trials, with each simulation taking an average of 1.22 seconds. CA-based models can bridge the gap between accuracy and applicability, successfully guiding public safety and fire suppression efforts.</description>

      <title>A Triad of Networks and a Triad of Fusions for the Other Climate Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaw and Stevens call for a new paradigm in climate science criticizes Large Scale Determinism in favor of (i) embracing discrepancies, (ii) embracing hierarchies, and (iii) create disruption while keeping interpretability. The last 20 years have seen a plethora of contributions relating complex networks with climate data and climate models. We provide a view of climate networks through a triad of frameworks and associated paradigms: (a) networks of data, where both (geographical) nodes and their links (arcs) are determined according to some metrics and/or statistical criteria; (b) climate data over networks, where the structure of the network (for both vertices and edges) is topologically pre-determined, and the climate variable is continuously defined over the (nonlinear) network; finally, (c) networks for data, referring to the huge machinery based on networks within the realm machine learning and statistics, with specific emphasis on their use for climate data. This paper is not a mere description of each element of the network triad, but rather a manifesto for the creation of three classes of fusions (we term them bridges). We advocate and carefully justify a fusion within to provide a corpus unicuum inside the network triad. We then prove that the fusion within is the starting point for a fusion between, where the network triad becomes a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Shaw-Stevens agenda. We culminate with a meta fusion that allows for the creation of what we term a Shaw-Stevens network ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Large scale statistically validated comorbidity networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain comorbidity networks starting from medical information stored in electronic health records collected by the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland (Varha). Based on the data, we associate each patient to one or more diseases and construct complex comorbidity networks associated with large patient cohorts characterized by an age interval and sex. The information about diseases in electronic health records is coded using the highest granularity present in the international classification of diseases (ICD codes) provided by the World Health Organization. We statistically validate links in each cohort comorbidity network and furthermore partition the networks into communities of diseases. These are characterized by the over-expression of a few disease categories, and communities from different age or sex cohorts show various similarities in terms of these disease classes. Moreover, all the detected communities for all the cohorts can be organized into a hierarchical tree. This allows us to observe a number of clusters of communities, originating from diverse age and sex cohorts, that group together communities characterized by the same disease classes. We also perform a dismantling procedure of statistically validated comorbidity networks to highlight those categories of diseases that are most responsible for the compactedness of the comorbidity networks for a given cohort of patients.</description>

      <title>Maritime Port Supply Chain Resilience: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime transportation systems (MTS) play a crucial role in ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential goods and services, impacting the economy, border security and general welfare. However, MTS operations face disruptions from natural disasters, man-made disturbances, or cascading combinations of these events. These threats can disrupt trade routes, pose serious risks to personnel, and damage critical port infrastructure. In today's advanced technological world, MTS also face growing threats from cyberattack and terrorist attack. Given these evolving risks, efforts to ensure resilience in port operations must be more inclusive, reflecting the full spectrum of potential threats. This article focuses on two key aspects of maritime transportation supply chain resilience (MTSCR): operational excellence and system technology. It presents a structured review framework of relevant literature including research papers and government documents, to explore strategies for strengthening MTSCR. The article classifies the review findings and highlights vulnerable areas requiring future research.</description>

      <title>Trends in New Mexico School Districts Serving Low-Income Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines recent enrollment trends and their socioeconomic drivers within New Mexico's public school districts, with a specific focus on those serving low-income communities. Utilizing a mixed-methods geospatial framework, the research integrates longitudinal enrollment data, district poverty metrics from the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), and neighborhood context from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2019 to 2023. The analysis reveals that while statewide K-12 enrollment has contracted, the decline is not uniformly distributed. Districts with high concentrations of low-income students have experienced more pronounced losses, though the relationship between poverty and enrollment change is complex and weak at the statewide level (r=0.011 in 2023). Spatial analysis shows a checkerboard pattern of growth and decline, even among adjacent high-poverty districts, indicating that local factors such as housing instability, labor market conditions, and programmatic changes are significant drivers. The study identifies 18 high-risk districts characterized by both high poverty and recent enrollment declines, which warrant targeted stabilization efforts. The findings underscore that while concentrated poverty is a critical challenge, it does not deterministically predict enrollment loss. Consequently, the authors propose a dual-track policy approach: immediate, flexible support for high-risk districts to ensure stabilization, coupled with long-term structural investments in all high-need districts to address underlying resource gaps and enable sustained educational offerings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Emergent Behaviors in Agent-Based Models using Mean Information Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent behaviors are a defining feature of complex systems, yet their quantitative characterization remains an open challenge, as traditional classifications rely mainly on visual inspection of spatio-temporal patterns. In this Letter, we propose using the Mean Information Gain (MIG) as a metric to quantify emergence in Agent-Based Models. The MIG is a conditional entropy-based metric that quantifies the lack of information about other elements in a structure given certain known properties. We apply it to a multi-agent biased random walk that reproduces Wolfram's four behavioral classes and show that MIG differentiates these behaviors. This metric reconnects the analysis of emergent behaviors with the classical notions of order, disorder, and entropy, thereby enabling the quantitative classification of regimes as convergent, periodic, complex, and chaotic. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of qualitative inspection near regime boundaries, particularly in large systems, and provides a compact, extensible framework for identifying and comparing emergent behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Austerity in Crisis?: A Narrative Review of Its Economic, Social, and Political Effects in Times of Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2008 global financial crisis marked the beginning of a decade dominated by fiscal austerity policies in much of the developed world. This paper presents a qualitative narrative review of an extensive collection of academic literature to synthesize evidence on the multifaceted effects of austerity. Following a thematic approach inspired by PRISMA guidelines, the economic, social, and political consequences of these measures are examined. The analysis reveals a majority consensus regarding the recessive effects of austerity, especially when implemented during economic crises, with negative fiscal multipliers that often exacerbate GDP contraction. Socially, austerity is associated with rising inequality, negative impacts on public health, disproportionate gender consequences, and a weakening of social safety nets. Politically, evidence links austerity to the erosion of trust in institutions, a rise in populism, and electoral instability. Despite the political narrative presenting austerity as an inevitable necessity for fiscal sustainability, academic literature underscores its high costs and questionable efficacy, advocating for more contextualized and equitable economic policy approaches.</description>

      <title>I2E2S2R Rumor Spreading Model in Homogeneous Network with Hesitating and Forgetting Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spreading and controlling of rumors have great impacts on our society. The transmission of infectious diseases and the spreading of rumors have some common scenarios. Like cross-infection propagation of diseases, two or many kinds of rumors or information may spread at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel I2E2S2R rumor-spreading model in a homogeneous network. The rumor-free equilibrium, as well as the basic reproduction number, have been calculated from the mean-field equations of the model. Lyapunov function and the LaSalle invariance principle are used to establish the global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium. In numerical simulations, it is perceived that a higher degree of network helps to spread rumors quickly. We have also found that making people aware can help to disappear rumors faster from the network. In addition, making people divert from the rumor to exact information can lessen the spreading of the rumor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal evolutionary model to show how local cooperation and global competition can create a transition to the diversity of communities such as linguistic groups. By using a lattice model with high-dimensional state agents and evolution under a fitness that depends on an agent's local neighborhood and global dissimilarity, clusters of diverse communities with different fitness are organized by equalizing the finesses on the boundaries, where their numbers and sizes are robust to parameters. We observe successive transitions over quasi-stationary states, as triggered by the emergence of new communities on the boundaries. Our abstract framework provides a simple mechanism for the diversification of culture.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis with geographic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features, exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121 datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility, while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.</description>

      <title>Interplay of choice and topology in percolation on mediation-driven attachment networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on mediation-driven attachment (MDA) networks under the generalized Achlioptas process, where $M&gt;1$ candidate bonds are sampled and the one that minimizes the resulting cluster size is selected the best-of-$M$ rule. This framework offers a systematic approach to investigate how network topology and choice mechanisms jointly shape percolation behavior. We analyze the effects of the degree exponent $\omega$ and the choice parameter $M$ on the critical point $t_c$ and the critical exponents ($\beta,\alpha,\gamma$), which define universality classes and obey the Rushbrooke inequality $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma \geq 2$. Using entropy, the order parameter, and their derivatives (representing specific heat and susceptibility respectively), we show that both $t_c$ and the universality class depend only weakly on $\omega$ but strongly on $M$, while the Rushbrooke inequality remains valid throughout. For $M=2$, the order parameter varies continuously without a clear order-disorder transition. By contrast, $M=3$ and $M=4$ display explosive percolation that still corresponds to a continuous phase transition, with $M=4$ producing a significantly sharper and clearer order-disorder transition. This sharpening is traced to an enhanced powder-keg effect at larger $M$, underscoring the entropic origin of explosive percolation.</description>

      <title>Universal emergence of local Zipf-Mandelbrot law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of natural and socio-economic phenomena share a striking statistical regularity, that is the magnitude of elements decreases with a power law as a function of their position in a ranking of magnitude. Such regularity is known as Zipf-Mandelbrot law (ZM), and plenty of problem-specific explanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an explanation for ZM ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper we first provide an analytical expression for the cumulants of any ranked sample of i.i.d. random variables once sorted in decreasing order. Then we make use of this result to rigorously demonstrate that, whenever a small fraction of such ranked dataset is considered, it becomes statistically indistinguishable from a ZM law. We finally validate our results against several relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Fractional stochastic model of citation dynamics with memory and volatility</title>

Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H &lt; 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H &gt; 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph: a model for generating realistic time-varying hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many complex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Informal Communication: An Archaeology of the Early Pre-Web Preprint Infrastructure at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the early development of preprint communication in high-energy physics, specifically with how preprint communication was formalized in the early 1960s at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It employs a sociological conception of infrastructures to ask which practices and technologies of communication structured the use of preprints in the field at the time and subsequently solidified into the research community's communication and information system. The text conducts an archaeology of the early preprint infrastructure along the lines of three systematic-historical explorations. 1. the use of preprints as media to privately and informally share practical instructions and theoretical tools in the fast-moving current of postwar theoretical physics, 2. the institutional and organizational context of library and documentation work at CERN around mid-century, which acted as a backdrop for creating the preprint infrastructure, and 3. the actual formalization of preprint communication into an information system at the CERN library in the early 1960s, which treated preprints as public "current awareness tools" for the benefit of the whole community, informing members of recent progress in the field. The article concludes with a discussion of what we can learn from the pre-Web history of the preprint communication in the field about current understandings of scientific communication.</description>

      <title>Fake News in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.06233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multi-agent reinforcement learning as a new method for modeling fake news in social networks. This method allows us to model human behavior in social networks both in unaccustomed populations and in populations that have adapted to the presence of fake news. In particular the latter is challenging for existing methods. We find that a fake-news attack is more effective if it targets highly connected people and people with weaker private information. Attacks are more effective when the disinformation is spread across several agents than when the disinformation is concentrated with more intensity on fewer agents. Furthermore, fake news spread less well in balanced networks than in clustered networks. We test a part of our findings in a human-subject experiment. The experimental evidence provides support for the predictions from the model, suggesting that the model is suitable to analyze the spread of fake news in social networks.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? The dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to address the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The United Nations Environmental Program's (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report, 2023, Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)'', and in 2024, No more hot air, emissions' massive gap between rhetoric and reality''. A climate emergency has been declared yet policies and emission reductions continue to fail. Global temperature anomalies in recent years have not been modelled well. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years), and a perturbation lifetime of 11.8 $\pm$ 1.8 yrs (IPCC AR6). It has a high, short-term impact on global warming: substantially greater than CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of CH4, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true, immediate climate impact of CH4 and its inability to incorporate varying emissions, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the multi-faceted implications of this under-reporting of CH4 emissions. Recalculation of 2024 Emissions Gap Report using a ten-year GWP of 105 increased CH4's warming effect to almost 90% of CO2, rather than 25% using a GWP100 of 28. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate time horizon for CH4's warming effects, accelerating climate emergency action, while recognizing the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of CH4 emissions on reduction efforts. To overcome the limitations of GWP100, a static constant, we propose GWPEFF(t) which dynamically represents warming across various time periods. It is a novel, physically realistic measure that is simple to understand, and effective for policies in reducing short-term emissions such as CH4.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough Asymmetries across Disciplines and Countries: A Network approach to Structural Complexity of Scientific Progress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is driven by community endeavors across diverse fields and specializations, forming a complex structure that renders conventional performance evaluation methods inadequate. Using established indicators, the network-based normalized citation score and the disruptive index, combined with the GENEPY algorithm, we evaluate the complexity rank of countries based on their breakthrough performance across 89 subfields of physical sciences, drawing on nearly 60 million articles (1900-2023). This quality-focused integrated approach reveals pronounced asymmetries: while countries such as the United States, Israel, and several in Europe sustain long-term structural advantages, emerging nations show rapid gains in later decades. A power-law relationship between aggregated breakthrough performance and countries' R&amp;D expenditure underscores the unequal and scale-dependent nature of global science. These results demonstrate that scientific advancement arises not from uniform growth but from asymmetric complexity, offering actionable insights for policymakers and funding agencies aiming to foster sustainable, high-quality research ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.</description>
