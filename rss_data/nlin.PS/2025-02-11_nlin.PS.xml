      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Fractional Thouless Pumping of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a soliton can be {\it fractionally} transported by slowly varying a system parameter over one period in a nonlinear system. This phenomenon is attributed to the nontrivial topology of the corresponding energy bands of a linear Hamiltonian. Here we find the occurrence of fractional Thouless pumping of solitons in a nonlinear off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model. Surprisingly, this happens despite the fact that all the energy bands of the linear Hamiltonian are topologically trivial, indicating that nonlinearity can induce fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Specifically, our results show that a soliton can be pumped across one unit cell over one, two, three or four pump periods, implying an average displacement of $1$, $1/2$, $1/3$ or $1/4$ unit cells per cycle, respectively. We attribute these behaviors to changes in on-site potentials induced by a soliton solution, leading to the nontrivial topology for the modified linear Hamiltonian. Given that our model relies solely on varying nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is readily implementable on existing state-of-the-art photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Slow Patterns in Multilayer Dislocation Evolution with Dynamic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the slow patterns of multilayer dislocation dynamics modeled by a multiscale parabolic equation in the half-plane coupled with a dynamic boundary condition on the interface. We focus on the influence of bulk dynamics with various relaxation time scales, on the slow motion pattern on the interface governed by an ODE system. Starting from a superposition of N stationary transition layers, at a specific time scale for the interface dynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N explicit transition profiles whose centers solve the ODE system with a repulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in the slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equation, where the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk and interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are constructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting behavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane.</description>

      <title>Spatial Pattern Formation in Eco-Evolutionary Games with Environment-Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainable management of common resources often leads to a social dilemma known as the tragedy of the commons: individuals benefit from rapid extraction of resources, while communities as a whole benefit from more sustainable extraction strategies. Such a social dilemma can be further complicated by the role played by space for both resources and harvesters, where spatial diffusion of resources and directed motion of harvesters can potentially feature the emergence of clusters of environmental resource and sustainable harvesting strategies. In this paper, we explore a PDE model of evolutionary game theory with environmental feedback, describing how the spatial distribution of resource extraction strategies and environmental resources can change due to both local eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental-driven directed motion of harvesters. Through linear stability analysis, we show that this biased motion towards higher-quality environments can lead to spatial patterns in the distribution of extraction strategies, creating local regions with improved environmental quality and increase payoff for resource extractors. However, by measuring the average payoff and environmental quality across the spatial domain, we see that this pattern-forming mechanism can actually decrease the overall success of the population relative to the equilibrium outcome in the absence of spatial motion. This suggests that environmental-driven motion can produce a spatial social dilemma, in which biased motion towards more beneficial regions can produce emergent patterns featuring a worse overall environment for the population.</description>
