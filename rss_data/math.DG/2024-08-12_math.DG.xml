      <title>Discrete Laplacians -- spherical and hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Laplacian on Euclidean triangulated surfaces is a well-established notion. We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and hyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to the Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain combinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is Delaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in several respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written in terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose expression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the usual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete conformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \in \{-1,1\}$ are $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth setting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of the vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the $-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron inscribed into corresponding quadrics.</description>

      <title>Internal geometry and functors between sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locality is implemented in an arbitrary category using Grothendieck topologies. We explore how different Grothendieck topologies on one category can be related, and, more general, how functors between categories can preserve them. As applications of locality, we review geometric objects such as sheaves, groupoids, functors, bibundles, and anafunctors internal to an arbitrary Grothendieck site. We give definitions such that all these objects are invariant under equivalences of Grothendieck topologies and certain functors between sites. As examples of sites, we look at categories of smooth manifolds, diffeological spaces, topological spaces, and sheaves, and we study properties of various functors between those.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the gaps between consecutive eigenvalues for a class of elliptic differential operators in divergence form on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain estimates for the upper bound of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues for the eigenvalue problem of a class of second-order elliptic differential operators in divergent form, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in a limited domain of n-dimensional Euclidean space. This class of operators includes the well-known Laplacian and the square Cheng-Yau operator. For the Laplacian case, our estimate coincides with that obtained by D. Chen, T. Zheng, and H. Yang, which is the best possible in terms of the order of the eigenvalues. For pinched Cartan-Hadamard manifolds the estimates were made in particular cases of this operator.</description>

      <title>K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a non-Archimedean characterization of K-semistability of log Fano cone singularities, and show that it agrees with the definition originally defined by Collins--Sz\'ekelyhidi. As an application, we show that to test K-semistability, it suffices to test special test configurations. We also show that special test configurations give rise to lc places of torus equivariant bounded complements.</description>

      <title>On the Cut Locus of Submanifolds of a Finsler Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cut locus of closed (not necessarily compact) submanifolds in a forward complete Finsler manifold. We explore the deformation and characterization of the cut locus, extending the results of Basu and the second author (\emph{Algebraic and Geometric Topology}, 2023). Given a submanifold $N$, we consider an $N$-geodesic loop as an $N$-geodesic starting and ending in $N$, possibly at different points. This class of geodesics were studied by Omori (\emph{Journal of Differential Geometry}, 1968). We obtain a generalization of Klingenberg's lemma for closed geodesics (\emph{Annals of Mathematics}, 1959) for $N$-geodesic loops in the reversible Finsler setting.</description>

      <title>Computing distances on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riemann surfaces are among the simplest and most basic geometric objects. They appear as key players in many branches of physics, mathematics, and other sciences. Despite their widespread significance, how to compute distances between pairs of points on compact Riemann surfaces is surprisingly unknown, unless the surface is a sphere or a torus. This is because on higher-genus surfaces, the distance formula involves an infimum over infinitely many terms, so it cannot be evaluated in practice. Here we derive a computable distance formula for a broad class of Riemann surfaces. The formula reduces the infimum to a minimum over an explicit set consisting of finitely many terms. We also develop a distance computation algorithm, which cannot be expressed as a formula, but which is more computationally efficient on surfaces with high genuses. We illustrate both the formula and the algorithm in application to generalized Bolza surfaces, which are a particular class of highly symmetric compact Riemann surfaces of any genus greater than 1.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-0 fields and conserved charges on n-dimensional Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>
