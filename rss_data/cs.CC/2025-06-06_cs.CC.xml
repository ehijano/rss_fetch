      <title>Identity Testing for Circuits with Exponentiation Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by practical applications in the design of optimization compilers for neural networks, we initiated the study of identity testing problems for arithmetic circuits augmented with \emph{exponentiation gates} that compute the real function $x\mapsto e^x$. These circuits compute real functions of form $P(\vec x)/P'(\vec x)$, where both $P(\vec x)$ and $P'(\vec x)$ are exponential polynomials
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k f_i(\vec x)\cdot \exp\left(\frac{g_i(\vec x)}{h_i(\vec x)}\right),
  \]
  for polynomials $f_i(\vec x),g_i(\vec x)$, and $h_i(\vec x)$.
  We formalize a black-box query model over finite fields for this class of circuits, which is mathematical simple and reflects constraints faced by real-world neural network compilers. We proved that a simple and efficient randomized identity testing algorithm achieves perfect completeness and non-trivial soundness. Concurrent with our work, the algorithm has been implemented in the optimization compiler Mirage by Wu et al.~(OSDI 2025), demonstrating promising empirical performance in both efficiency and soundness error. Finally, we propose a number-theoretic conjecture under which our algorithm is sound with high probability.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Analysis for Symbolic Computation: Root Isolation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce beyond-worst-case analysis into symbolic computation. This is an extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear (expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Computation in First-Price Auctions with Correlated Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of computing Bayes-Nash equilibria in first-price auctions, where the bidders' values for the item are drawn from a general (possibly correlated) joint distribution. We show that when the values and the bidding space are discrete, determining the existence of a pure Bayes-Nash equilibrium is NP-hard. This is the first hardness result in the literature of the problem that does not rely on assumptions of subjectivity of the priors, or convoluted tie-breaking rules. We then present two main approaches for achieving positive results, via bid sparsification and via bid densification. The former is more combinatorial and is based on enumeration techniques, whereas the latter makes use of the continuous theory of the problem developed in the economics literature. Using these approaches, we develop polynomial-time approximation algorithms for computing equilibria in symmetric settings or settings with a fixed number of bidders, for different (discrete or continuous) variants of the auction.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of 2-club Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Editing a graph to obtain a disjoint union of s-clubs is one of the models for correlation clustering, which seeks a partition of the vertex set of a graph so that elements of each resulting set are close enough according to some given criterion. For example, in the case of editing into s-clubs, the criterion is proximity since any pair of vertices (in an s-club) are within a distance of s from each other. In this work we consider the vertex splitting operation, which allows a vertex to belong to more than one cluster. This operation was studied as one of the parameters associated with the Cluster Editing problem. We study the complexity and parameterized complexity of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion with Vertex Splitting and s-Club Cluster Vertex Splitting problems. Both problems are shown to be NP-Complete and APX-hard. On the positive side, we show that both problems are Fixed-Parameter Tractable with respect to the number of allowed editing operations and that s-Club Cluster Vertex Splitting is solvable in polynomial-time on the class of forests.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Manipulation of International Kidney Exchange Programmes with Country-Specific Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>
