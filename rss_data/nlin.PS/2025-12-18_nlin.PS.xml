      <title>Guided vortex bullets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of the variational method and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of stable 3D nonlinear modes, viz. vortex ``bullets'', in the form of pulsed beams carrying orbital angular momentum, that can self-trap in a 2D waveguiding structure. Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons.</description>

      <title>Multi-kinks and composite oscillons in a commensurable and non degenerate double sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a commensurable and non-degenerate double sine-Gordon model, in which a partial breaking of vacuum degeneracy provides a mechanism for the emergence of static multi-kinks. These multi-kinks $K_n$ are stable field configurations with internal structure, consisting of $n$ localized energy packets with well-defined separations. The properties of the multi-kinks are thoroughly analyzed, including the novel phenomenology that arises during their collisions. In particular, we observe the emergence of long-lived composite oscillons that reflect the original structure of the multi-kinks. The sub-kink's positions and their vibration modes provide collective coordinates that are used to construct a phenomenological model, which offers a good qualitative explanation of the observed oscillon properties. Radiation effects are consistently incorporated, revealing that they play an important role in the observed synchronization of the oscillon's vibrational components.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>
