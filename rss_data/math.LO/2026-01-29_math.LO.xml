      <title>Foundations with Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that countable set theory, $ZFC^{-}+\forall x\ |x|\leq\omega$, is unable to eliminate imaginaries. In other words, this theory cannot provide representatives for arbitrary definable equivalence relations. We also see that $ZFC^{-}$ and ZFC^{-}+\exists\kappa(Inacc(\kappa)\wedge\forall x\ |x|\leq\kappa)$ also fail to eliminate imaginaries.</description>

      <title>On groups definable in $p$-adically closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the $dfg$/$fsg$ decomposition for groups $G$ definable in $p$-adically closed fields. It is proved that for $G$ definably amenable, $G$ has a definable normal $dfg$ subgroup $H$ such that the quotient $G/H$ is a definable $fsg$ group. The result was known for groups definable in $o$-minimal expansions of real closed fields (see \cite{C-P-o-mini}). We also give a version for arbitrary (not necessarily definably amenable) groups $G$ definable in $p$-adically closed fields: there is a definable $dfg$ subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that the homogeneous space $G/H$ is definable and definably compact. (In the $o$-minimal case this is Fact 3.25 of \cite{Peterzil-Starchenko-mutypes}).
  Note that $dfg$ stands for ``has a definable $f$-generic type", and $fsg$ for ``has finitely satisfiable generics", which will be discussed together with various equivalences.
  We will need to understand something about groups of the form $G(k)$ where $k$ is a $p$-adically closed field and $G$ a semisimple algebraic group over $k$, and as part of the analysis we will prove the Kneser-Tits conjecture over $p$-adically closed fields.</description>

      <title>A parametrized $\diamondsuit$ for the Laver property and nontrivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new parametrized diamond principle denoted $\diamondsuit(\mathsf{LP})$. This principle is akin to the parametrized diamonds of Moore, Hru\v{s}\'ak, and D\v{z}amonja, each of which corresponds to some cardinal invariant of the continuum, and gives a $\diamondsuit$-like guessing principle implying the corresponding invariant is $\aleph_1$. Our principle $\diamondsuit(\mathsf{LP})$ is a $\diamondsuit$-like guessing principle implying the Laver property holds over a given inner model, such as the ground model in a forcing extension.
  We show $\diamondsuit(\mathsf{LP})$ holds in many familiar models of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ obtained by forcing, namely those obtained from a model of $\mathsf{CH}$ by a length-$\omega_2$ countable support iteration of proper Borel posets with the Laver property. This is true for essentially the same reason that the usual parametrized diamonds hold in similarly described forcing extensions where their corresponding cardinal invariant is $\aleph_1$.
  We also prove that if $\diamondsuit(\mathsf{LP})$ holds over an inner model of $\mathsf{CH}$ then there are nontrivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{Fin}$; in fact we get particularly nice automorphisms extending nontrivial involutions built around $P$-points in the ground model. Additionally, we show that, like the Sacks model, all automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\omega)/\mathrm{Fin}$ are somewhere trivial in the Mathias model. This puts a limitation on the kinds of automorphisms obtainable from $\diamondsuit(\mathsf{LP})$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Switching Conditions for the Generalized Logical Connectives in Multiplicative Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.02540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Danos and Regnier (1989) introduced the par-switching condition for multiplicative proof-structures and simplified the sequentialization theorem of Girard (1987) by means of par-switching. Danos and Regnier (1989) also generalized the par-switching to a switching for n-ary connectives (hereafter called an n-ary switching) and showed that the "expansion" property holds, namely that any "excluded-middle" formula admits a correct proof-net in the sense of their n-ary switching. They added a remark that the sequentialization theorem does not hold with their switching. Their definition of switching for n-ary connectives is a natural generalization of the original switching for the binary connectives. However, there are many other possible definitions of switching for n-ary connectives. We give an alternative and "natural" definition of n-ary switching, and we show that the proof of sequentialization theorem by Olivier Laurent with the par-switching works for our n-ary switching; Consequently, the sequentialization theorem holds for our n-ary switching. On the other hand, we remark that the "expansion" property no longer holds under our switching anymore. We point out that no definition of n-ary switching satisfies both the sequentialization theorem and the "expansion" property at the same time except for the purely tensor-based (or purely par-based) connectives.</description>

      <title>Deducibility of Identicals, Reflection Principle and Synthetic Connectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05120v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sambin et al. (2000) introduced Basic Logic as a uniform framework for various logics. At the same time, they also introduced the principle of reflection as a criterion for being a connective in Basic Logic. In this paper, we make explicit the relationship between Hacking's deducibility of identicals condition (Hacking, 1979) and the principle of reflection by proving their equivalence. Moreover, despite Sambin et al.'s conjecture that only six connectives satisfy the principle of reflection, we show that a logical connective satisfies the principle of reflection if and only if it is Girard's synthetic connective.</description>

      <title>Stability in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop foundational aspects of stability theory in affine logic. On the one hand, we prove appropriate affine versions of many classical results, including definability of types, existence of non-forking extensions, and other fundamental properties of forking calculus. Most notably, stationarity holds over arbitrary sets (in fact, every type is Lascar strong). On the other hand, we prove that stability is preserved under direct integrals of measurable fields of structures. We deduce that stability in the extremal models of an affine theory implies stability of the theory. We also deduce that the affine part of a stable continuous logic theory is affinely stable, generalising the result of preservation of stability under randomisations.</description>

      <title>Goldstern's Principle with respect to Hausdorff Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25] and studies Goldstern's principle, a principle about unions of continuum many null sets, further. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Moreover, we show that this version holds provided that the measurable cardinal exists. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Tukey morphisms between binary relations, establishing several fundamental lemmas. We then specialize to finite binary relations, using computational methods to classify all binary relations with at most $6$ points in the domain and codomain up to bimorphism. Finally we give a construction of finite binary relations with arbitrary dominating number and dual dominating number.</description>

      <title>Locality in Residuated-Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-valued models generalise the structures from classical model theory by defining truth values for a model with an arbitrary algebra. Just as algebraic varieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models defined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding non-classical predicate logics. In particular, models defined over varieties of residuated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructural logics.
  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems from Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We demonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in the generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the case of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural understanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable with an alternative understanding for well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than consider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the theorem from textbook proofs - that models which satisfy the same basic local sentences are elementarily equivalent. We prove that for a number of different understandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to express locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered. In each case we will see the importance of an order-interpreting connective which creates a link between the modelling relation for models and formulas and the valuation function from formulas into the algebra. This link enables a syntactic encoding of back-and-forth systems providing the main technical ingredient to proofs of the main locality results.</description>
