      <title>A Practical Finite Element Approach for Simulating Dynamic Crack Growth in Cu/Ultra Low-k Interconnect Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a practical finite element modeling strategy, the Crack Element Method (CEM), for simulating the dynamic crack propagation in two-dimensional structures. The method employs an element-splitting algorithm based on the Edge-based Smoothed Finite Element Method (ES-FEM) to capture the element-wise crack growth while reducing the formation of poorly shaped elements that can compromise numerical accuracy and computational performance. A fracture energy release rate formulation is also developed based on the evolving topology of the split elements. The proposed approach is validated through a series of classical benchmark problems, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness in addressing dynamic fracture scenarios. Finally, the applicability of the CEM is illustrated in a case study involving patterned Cu/Ultra Low-k interconnect structures.</description>

      <title>WeightFlow: Learning Stochastic Dynamics via Evolving Weight of Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling stochastic dynamics from discrete observations is a key interdisciplinary challenge. Existing methods often fail to estimate the continuous evolution of probability densities from trajectories or face the curse of dimensionality. To address these limitations, we presents a novel paradigm: modeling dynamics directly in the weight space of a neural network by projecting the evolving probability distribution. We first theoretically establish the connection between dynamic optimal transport in measure space and an equivalent energy functional in weight space. Subsequently, we design WeightFlow, which constructs the neural network weights into a graph and learns its evolution via a graph controlled differential equation. Experiments on interdisciplinary datasets demonstrate that WeightFlow improves performance by an average of 43.02\% over state-of-the-art methods, providing an effective and scalable solution for modeling high-dimensional stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>LEO: An Open-Source Platform for Linking OMERO with Lab Notebooks and Heterogeneous Metadata Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interdisciplinary field of microscopy research, managing and integrating large volumes of data stored across disparate platforms remains a major challenge. Data types such as bioimages, experimental records, and spectral information are often maintained in separate repositories, each following different management standards. However, linking these data sources across the research lifecycle is essential to align with the FAIR principles of data management: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Despite this need, there is a notable lack of tools capable of effectively integrating and linking data from heterogeneous sources. To address this gap, we present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based platform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems. LEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a plugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources. This extensibility makes LEO a scalable and flexible solution for a wide range of microscopy research workflows.</description>

      <title>Contact Sensors to Remote Cameras: Quantifying Cardiorespiratory Coupling in High-Altitude Exercise Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) captures the dynamic interaction between the cardiac and respiratory systems--an interaction strengthened by physical exercise and linked to improved physiological function. We examined CRC at high altitude in two states, rest and post-exercise recovery, and found significant differences (p &lt; 0.05). Quantitative analysis revealed that recovery involved more frequent yet less stable episodes of synchronization between respiration and pulse. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of non-contact CRC measurement with remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), observing a strong correlation with oximeter-based metrics (Pearson r = 0.96). These findings highlight the potential of CRC as a sensitive marker for autonomic regulation and its future application in contactless monitoring.

      <title>{\tau}-Ring: A Smart Ring Platform for Multimodal Physiological and Behavioral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart rings have emerged as uniquely convenient devices for continuous physiological and behavioral sensing, offering unobtrusive, constant access to metrics such as heart rate, motion, and skin temperature. Yet most commercial solutions remain proprietary, hindering reproducibility and slowing innovation in wearable research. We introduce {\tau}-Ring, a commercial-ready platform that bridges this gap through: (i) accessible hardware combining time-synchronized multi-channel PPG, 6-axis IMU, temperature sensing, NFC, and on-board storage; (ii) adjustable firmware that lets researchers rapidly reconfigure sampling rates, power modes, and wireless protocols; and (iii) a fully open-source Android software suite that supports both real-time streaming and 8-hour offline logging. Together, these features enable out-of-the-box, reproducible acquisition of rich physiological and behavioral datasets, accelerating prototyping and standardizing experimentation. We validate the platform with demonstration studies in heart-rate monitoring and ring-based handwriting recognition.

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Carbon Emission Predictions using Real-Time Recurrent Learning for State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Weak Values as Geometric Lenses: Deformations of Hilbert Space and the Emergence of superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of weak measurement in quantum mechanics has revealed profound connections between measurement theory, quantum foundations, and signal processing. In this paper, we develop a pointer-free derivation of superoscillations, demonstrating that they are a natural and necessary consequence of the geometric structure underlying weak values. We argue that the weak value is best understood as a ratio of geometric deformation, quantifying how an observable transforms the structure of Hilbert space relative to a reference provided by the standard inner product. This deformation acts as a conceptual lens, warping the local structure of quantum states to produce oscillations far exceeding the global Fourier bandwidth. We formalize this by interpreting the weak value as a comparison between a deformed sesquilinear form and the standard one, and explore its deep connections to generalized Rayleigh quotients and the projective geometry of quantum states. This perspective unifies weak values and superoscillations as two facets of a single underlying geometric principle.</description>

      <title>Advancing Welding Defect Detection in Maritime Operations via Adapt-WeldNet and Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.</description>

      <title>$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.</description>

      <title>The time slot allocation problem in liberalised passenger railway markets: a multi-objective approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The liberalisation of the European passenger railway markets through the European Directive EU 91/440/EEC states a new scenario where different Railway Undertakings compete with each other in a bidding process for time slots. The infrastructure resources are provided by the Infrastructure Manager, who analyses and assesses the bids received, allocating the resources to each Railway Undertaking. Time slot allocation is a fact that drastically influences the market equilibrium. In this paper, we address the time slot allocation problem within the context of a liberalized passenger railway market as a multi-objective model. The Infrastructure Manager is tasked with selecting a point from the Pareto front as the solution to the time slot allocation problem. We propose two criteria for making this selection: the first one allocates time slots to each company according to a set of priorities, while the second one introduces a criterion of fairness in the treatment of companies to incentive competition. The assessment of the impact of these rules on market equilibrium has been conducted on a liberalized high-speed corridor within the Spanish railway network.</description>

      <title>A Multi-physics Model of Flow from Coronary Angiography: Insights to Microvascular Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) is characterized by impaired vasodilation and can lead to insufficient blood flow to the myocardium during stress or exertion, affecting millions of people globally. Despite their diagnostic value, invasive, wire-based diagnosis techniques of CMD, such as index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), are underutilized due to their complexity and inconsistency. Coronary angiography, one of the most commonly used imaging modalities, offers valuable flow information that assists in diagnosing CMD. However, this information is not fully understood or utilized in current clinical practice. In this study, a 3D-0D coupled multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and calibrated to simulate and study the process of contrast injection and washout during clinical angiography. A contrast intensity profile (CIP) was introduced to describe the dynamics of coronary angiography data. Additionally, sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of various coronary lumped parameter model (LPM) parameters on the shapes of CIPs. The results demonstrate that the multi-physics model can be effectively calibrated to produce physiologically meaningful hemodynamic results. Sensitivity studies reveal that resistance has a greater impact on the rising and falling slopes of CIP than capacitance, with higher resistance amplifying this effect. The model and results are presented here. These results are potentially transformative, as they provide a tool for interpreting angiographic data and ultimately extracting information concerning coronary microcirculation.</description>

      <title>PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</description>
