      <title>Thermal Phase Curves in Hot Gas Giant Exoplanets Exhibit a Complex Dependence on Planetary Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of uniformly processed 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m band exoplanet thermal phase curves based on Infrared Array Camera observations obtained from the Spitzer Heritage Archive. The catalog includes phase curve measurements for 34 planets, 16 of which contain full orbit coverage and have detectable secondary eclipses in both channels. The data are processed in the EXCALIBUR pipeline using a uniform analysis consisting of aperture photometry and modeling of instrument effects along with the exoplanet signal. Nearest-neighbors regression with a Gaussian kernel is used to correct for instrumental systematics correlated to the star's centroid position and shape in conjunction with a novel test to avoid overfitting. These methods may have utility in addressing sub-pixel gain variations present in modern infrared detectors. We analyze the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties and find a strong wavelength-dependent difference in how the properties correlate with physical parameters as well as evidence that the phase curve properties are determined by multiple physical parameters. We suggest that differences between the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties are due to 3.6~$\mu$m observations probing regions of the atmosphere which could include a cloud layer. Taken together, the observed phase curve behavior suggests that different physical processes are responsible for establishing the thermal phase curve at different pressures, which are probed by different wavelengths, and that further 3D GCM modeling is required to investigate the reason for this complex dependence on planetary properties.</description>

      <title>Formation of Ultra-short-period Planet in Hot Jupiter Systems: Application to WASP-47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WASP-47 system is notable as the first known system hosting both inner and outer low-mass planetary companions around a hot Jupiter, with an ultra-short-period (USP) planet as the innermost planetary companion. The formation of such an unique configuration poses challenges to the lonely hot Jupiter formation model. Hot Jupiters in multiple planetary systems may have a similar formation process with warm Jupiter systems, which are more commonly found with companions. This implies that the WASP-47 system could bridge our understanding of both hot and warm Jupiter formation. In this work, we propose a possible formation scenario for the WASP-47 system based on its orbital configuration. The mean motion resonance trapping, giant planet perturbations, and tidal effects caused by the central star are key factors in the formation of USP planets in multiple planetary systems with hot Jupiters. Whether a planet can become an USP planet or a short period super-earth (SPSE) planet depends on the competition between eccentricity excitation by nearby giant planet perturbations and the eccentricity damping due to tidal effects. The $Q_p'$ value of the innermost planet is essential for the final planetary configuration. Our results suggest that a $Q_p'$ in the range of [1, 10] is favorable for the formation of the WASP-47 system. Based on the formation scenario, we estimate an occurrence rate of 8.4$\pm$2.4\% for USP planets in systems similar to WASP-47.</description>

      <title>Investigating the formation of small Solar System objects using stellar occultations by satellites: present, future and its use to update satellite orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of the outer solar system is intrinsically related to the Giant Planets migration. A massive disk of material within a radius of 30~au was scattered during the planetary migration, creating different dynamic populations in the Transneptunian region. They were formed in a collisional environment when massive collisions allowed them to grow and form much smaller moons than the primary body. The dynamical group, known as the Cold Classicals, was formed in a sparse disk from 42 to about 47~au and did not suffer much from planet migration. Observations show that many of Cold Classical are binary, consistent with the streaming instability process. The stellar occultation technique, with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres, can be used to search for binaries where other techniques are unable to do so, and to characterise the known satellites of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO), constraining their formation scenarios. We review here the first stellar occultations by TNO's satellites (besides Charon), discuss the methods used to detect these events. We also fit new orbital elements and system mass for Vanth (Orcus/1) and Weywot (Quaoar/1), finding reasonable solutions for pure Keplerian orbits. Finally, we discuss the prospects regarding the stellar occultations by TNO binaries and their implications for the study of the history of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Mars' Young Sedimentary Rocks: Early thinning, late persistence, diachronous boundaries, and a regional dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars' sedimentary rocks record Gyrs of environmental change. New data enable the first global analysis of paleo-environment relevant physical properties of these rocks, including layer thickness and accumulation rate. We find that layer thicknesses of post-3.5 Ga sedimentary rocks across the Martian surface show coherent variations at ~1000 km-scale that are inconsistent with simple volcanic and climatic hypotheses for formation, which are consistent with global compositional homogeneity at orbital scales. These data, in combination with new analyses of outcrop age and total rock volume demonstrate a global decrease in layer thickness that predates the eventual drop off in preserved sedimentary rock volume per Myr. The new constraints confirm a diachronous transition in Mars' global sedimentary rock record while also highlighting a regional dichotomy in young sedimentary rock deposits that has not been quantified before.</description>

      <title>Dust coagulation assisted by streaming instability in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability is a promising mechanism for planetesimal formation. The instability can rapidly form dense clumps that collapse self-gravitationally, which is efficient for large dust grains with the Stokes number on the order of 0.1. However, dust growth models predict that collisional fragmentation prevents dust grains from growing to such sizes. We perform local simulations of the streaming instability and measure characteristic collision velocities and collision rates of dust grains based on their trajectories in moderate clumping. The collision velocities are on the order of 0.1 percent of the sound speed or lower, implying that dust grains can overcome the fragmentation barrier via the clumping. We also find that the collision rates are appreciably high regardless of the low collision velocities. Corresponding timescales are on the order of ten Keplerian periods or shorter, suggesting that dust grains can overcome the drift barrier as well. This streaming-instability-assisted (SI-assisted) coagulation greatly relaxes the conditions for planetesimal formation as recently implied.</description>

      <title>Quantified Estimation of Molecular Detections across Different Classes of Neptunian Atmospheres Using Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy: Prospects for Future Extremely Large Telescopes with High-Resolution Spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neptune-size exoplanets are less studied as characterizing their atmospheres presents challenges due to their relatively small radius and atmospheric scale height. As the most common outcome of planet formation, these planets are crucial for understanding planetary formation, migration theories, atmospheric composition, and potential habitability. Their diverse atmospheres, influenced by equilibrium temperature, composition, and cloud presence, offer unique opportunities to study atmospheric dynamics and chemistry. While low-resolution spectroscopy struggles with atmospheric characterization due to clouds, high-resolution observations provide detailed analysis of the atmospheres by detecting molecular lines beyond the cloud deck. This study investigates four subclasses of Neptune atmospheres: HAT-P-11 b (warm Neptune), HD 63433 c (warm sub-Neptune), K2-25 b (temperate Neptune), and TOI-270 d (temperate sub-Neptune), using six ground-based spectrographs: GIANO-B, CARMENES, IGRINS, HISPEC, MODHIS, and ANDES over one and three transits. Our simulation integrates the chemical kinetics model, VULCAN with the 1-D line-by-line radiative transfer model, petitRADTRANS, and estimates detection significance using the ground-based noise simulator, SPECTR. We aim to predict how future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) such as TMT (MODHIS) and E-ELT (ANDES) can utilize their higher resolving powers and larger collecting areas to surpass current observatories in detecting molecular bands. We highlight the importance of photochemistry in these atmospheres and demonstrate how ELTs will help further in constraining nitrogen and sulfur chemistry. Finally, we present a comprehensive picture of cloud presence in the atmospheres and its impact on molecular detectability in Neptune-class atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Understanding the formation of Saturn's regular moons in the context of giant planet moons formation scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the different formation scenarios of the Kronian moons system in the context of a highly dissipative Saturn, with the objective of identifying the most likely of these scenarios. First, we review the diversity of objects - moons and rings - orbiting solar system giant planets, and the diversity of their architectures, which formation scenarios must reproduce. We then identify in this broader context the specific features of the Saturn system, such as the particularly large spectrum of its moon masses, the uniqueness of Titan and the presence of both dense and tenuous rings, before discussing the applicability of the different giant planet moon formation scenarios to the Saturn case. We discuss each of the most relevant scenarios and their respective merits. Finally, we tentatively propose a "favorite" scenario and we identify the key observations to be made by future space missions and/or Earth-based telescopic observations to validate this scenario or possibly alternative ones.</description>

      <title>Shape and spin state model of contact binary (388188) 2006 DP14 using combined radar and optical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact binaries are found throughout the solar system. The recent discovery of Selam, the satellite of MBA (152830) Dinkinesh, by the NASA LUCY mission has made it clear that the term `contact binary' covers a variety of different types of bi-modal mass distributions and formation mechanisms. Only by modelling more contact binaries can this population be properly understood. We determined a spin state and shape model for the Apollo group contact binary asteroid (388188) 2006 DP14 using ground-based optical and radar observations collected between 2014 and 2023. Radar delay-Doppler images and continuous wave spectra were collected over two days in February 2014, while 16 lightcurves in the Cousins R and SDSS-r filters were collected in 2014, 2022 and 2023. We modelled the spin state using convex inversion before using the SHAPE modelling software to include the radar observations in modelling concavities and the distinctive neck structure connecting the two lobes. We find a spin state with a period of $(5.7860\pm0.0001)$ hours and pole solution of $\lambda = (180\pm121)^\circ$ and $\beta = (-80\pm7)^\circ$ with morphology indicating a 520 m long bi-lobed shape. The model's asymmetrical bi-modal mass distribution resembles other small NEA contact binaries such as (85990) 1999 JV6 or (8567) 1996 HW1, which also feature a smaller `head' attached to a larger `body'. The final model features a crater on the larger lobe, similar to several other modelled contact binaries. The model's resolution is 25 m, comparable to that of the radar images used.</description>

      <title>A Population Synthesis Study on the Formation of Cold Jupiters from Truncated Planetesimal Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence rate of giant planets increases with orbital period and turns over at a location that roughly corresponds to the snow line of solar-type stars. Further, the density distribution of cold Jupiters (CJs) on the semi-major axis - mass diagram shows a relatively steep inner boundary, shaping the desert of warm Jupiters. The eccentricities of CJs show a broad distribution with a decreasing number density towards the larger end. Previous planet formation models fail to reproduce all these features at the same time. We use a planet population synthesis (PPS) model with truncated initial planetesimal distribution and compare the mass and orbital distribution of the simulated planets with the observation. We show that the occurrence of CJs with respect to the orbital period, the slope of the inner boundary of CJs on the semi-major axis - mass diagram, and the eccentricity distribution of CJs agree reasonably well with observation, if CJs form from truncated planetesimal disks of 10 au or wider with suppressed migration. While PPS simulations generally overestimate the fraction of giants with eccentricity below 0.2, $N$-body simulations produce a more consistent eccentricity distribution with observation. While the fraction of high-eccentricity planets can be increased by widening the planetesimal disk or reducing the migration speed, a deficit of giants with eccentricity between 0.2-0.4 exists regardless of the choices of parameters. Our results indicate that CJs are more likely born in truncated disks near the snow line than in classical uniform disks.</description>

      <title>A temperate super-Jupiter imaged with JWST in the mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the ~25 directly imaged planets to date, all are younger than 500Myr and all but 6 are younger than 100Myr. Eps Ind A (HD209100, HIP108870) is a K5V star of roughly solar age (recently derived as 3.7-5.7Gyr and 3.5$^{+0.8}_{-1.3}$Gyr). A long-term radial velocity trend as well as an astrometric acceleration led to claims of a giant planet orbiting the nearby star (3.6384$\pm$0.0013pc). Here we report JWST coronagraphic images that reveal a giant exoplanet which is consistent with these radial and astrometric measurements, but inconsistent with the previously claimed planet properties. The new planet has temperature ~275K, and is remarkably bright at 10.65um and 15.50um. Non-detections between 3.5-5um indicate an unknown opacity source in the atmosphere, possibly suggesting a high metallicity, high carbon-to-oxygen ratio planet. The best-fit temperature of the planet is consistent with theoretical thermal evolution models, which are previously untested at this temperature range. The data indicates that this is likely the only giant planet in the system and we therefore refer to it as ``b", despite it having significantly different orbital properties than the previously claimed planet ``b".</description>

      <title>The Interplay between Dust Dynamics and Turbulence Induced by the Vertical Shear Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) plays a crucial role in setting the stage of planet formation. In particular, the streaming instability (SI) is well recognized as the mechanism for planetesimal formation out of this interaction. The outer region of PPDs is likely subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk turbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust stirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through the Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust concentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to conduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D global simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is weakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of initial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal flows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy, suppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances dust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to assess dust clumping.</description>

      <title>Gone with the wind: the outward migration of eccentric giant planets in windy disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence, with their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds. However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a "fixed-planet" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion of main-belt asteroids on human timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion of high-precision astrometric data on main-belt asteroids (MBAs) enables new inferences on gravitational and non-gravitational forces present in this region. We estimate the size of MBA motions caused by mutual gravitational encounters with other MBAs that are either omitted from ephemeris models or have uncertain mass estimates. In other words, what is the typical Brownian motion among MBAs that cannot be predicted from the ephemeris, and therefore serves as noise on inferences from the MBAs? We estimate the RMS azimuthal shift $\sigma_\phi$ of this ``Brownian noise'' by numerical estimation of the distribution of impulse sizes and directions among known MBAs, combined with analytical propagation into future positional uncertainties. At current levels of asteroid-mass knowledge, $\sigma_\phi$ rises to $\approx2$ km or $\approx1$ mas over $T=10$ yr, increasing as $T^{3/2},$ large enough to degrade many inferences from Gaia and LSST MBA data. LSST data will, however, improve MBA mass knowledge enough to lower this Brownian uncertainty by $\ge4\times.$ Radial and vertical Brownian noise at $T=10$ yr are factors $\approx7$ and $\approx45,$ respectively, lower than the azimuthal noise, and grow as $T^{3/2}$ and $T^{1/2}.$ For full exploitation of Gaia and LSST MBA data, ephemeris models should include the $\approx1000$ largest asteroids as active bodies with free masses, even if not all are well constrained. This will correctly propagate the uncertainties from these 1000 sources' deflections into desired inferences. The RMS value of deflections from less-massive MBAs is then just $\sigma_\phi\approx60$ m or 30 $\mu$as, small enough to ignore until occultation-based position data become ubiquitously available for MBAs.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.</description>

      <title>The azimuthal distribution of ejecta mass from oblique impacts into sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure ejecta mass as a function of azimuthal and impact angle for 104 m/s oblique impacts into sand. We find that the ejecta mass distribution is strongly sensitive to azimuthal angle with as high as 8 times more mass in ejecta on the downrange side compared to the uprange side. Crater radii, measured from the impact point, are measured at different impact and azimuthal angles. Crater ejecta scaling laws are modified to depend on azimuthal and impact angle. We find that crater radii are sensitive to both impact and azimuthal angle but the ejecta mass as a function of both angles can be estimated from the cube of the crater radius without an additional angular dependent function. The ejecta distributions are relevant for processes that depend upon the integrated properties of approximately 100 m/s impacts occurring in the outer solar system and possibly during planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population that is fundamentally different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Instrumental Drift in MAROON-X using an Ensemble Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MAROON-X is a state-of-the-art extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph deployed on the 8.1-meter Gemini-N telescope on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Using a stabilized Fabry-P\'erot etalon for wavelength and drift calibration, MAROON-X has achieved a short-term precision of $\sim$\,30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$. However, due to a long-term drift in the etalon (2.2\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ per day) and various interruptions of the instrument baseline over the first few years of operation, MAROON-X experiences RV offsets between observing runs several times larger than the short-term precision during any individual run, which hinders the detection of longer-period signals. In this study, we analyze RV measurements of 11 targets that either exhibit small RV scatter or have signals that can be precisely constrained using Keplerian or Gaussian Process models. Leveraging this ensemble, we calibrate MAROON-X's run offsets for data collected between September 2020 and early January 2024 to a precision of $\sim$0.5\,m\,s$^{-1}$. When applying these calibrated offsets to HD 3651, a quiet star, we obtain residual velocities with an RMS of $&lt;$70\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ in both the Red and Blue channels of MAROON-X over a baseline of 29 months. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of MAROON-X data calibrated with these offsets through a series of injection-recovery tests. Based on our findings, MAROON-X is capable of detecting sub m\,s$^{-1}$ signals out to periods of more than 1,000 days.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of a Previous Dynamical Instability in Multi-planet M-Dwarf Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify observational signatures suggesting a history of dynamical instability in 26 out of 34 M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. These systems may have primarily formed in a gas-rich environment, potentially hosted more planets and were more compact. We extend previous simulations of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system to 100 Myr to test the stability of these systems without gas. We find the absence of a strong mean motion resonance in the innermost planet pair and the absence of three body resonances throughout the system are likely to result in the merging and ejection of planets after the gas disk disperses. The runs that experience such an instability tend to produce final systems with lower multiplicities, period ratios larger than two, increased orbital spacings, higher planetary angular momentum deficits, and slightly smaller mass ratios between adjacent planets. Remarkably, we find these same trends in the observations of M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. Our work allows us to identify specific systems that may have experienced an instability and suggests that only ~25% of these systems formed in their current observed state while most systems were likely more compact and multiplicitous earlier in time. Previous research indicates that systems that have experienced a late stage giant impact may host planets potentially more habitable than the systems that did not. With this in mind, we suggest systems around M-dwarfs that contain period ratios larger than two be given priority in the search for habitable worlds.</description>
