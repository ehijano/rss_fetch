      <title>Underwater Multi-Wavelength Optical Links With Blue Targets and Constraints: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater optical wireless technologies offer multiple advantages over the acoustic technology. Acoustic signals, for instance, are susceptible to noise from marine sources due to marine life and human activities. This is not the case with optical signals. However, absorption and scattering significantly attenuate optical signals. This limits the communication range and requires higher transmission power or more sensitive receivers to detect transmitted light. Therefore, it is necessary to design underwater optical systems with a higher transmission rate and reduced attenuation. To this end, we introduce a framework for designing optical signaling constellations employing multi-wavelength light sources to account for the transmission distance and achievable rate. In particular, we redefine the color-shift keying (CSK) constraint region to target blue light and adapt to marine environments. We discuss an example of 4-point underwater CSK. The corresponding analytical results demonstrate the trade-offs between the symbol error probability, achievable rate, and transmission range of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Two-Way Communications: Algorithmic Framework and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based feedback channel coding has garnered significant research interest in the past few years. However, there has been limited research exploring ML approaches in the so-called "two-way" setting where two users jointly encode messages and feedback for each other over a shared channel. In this work, we present a general architecture for ML-based two-way feedback coding, and show how several popular one-way schemes can be converted to the two-way setting through our framework. We compare such schemes against their one-way counterparts, revealing error-rate benefits of ML-based two-way coding in certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We then analyze the tradeoffs between error performance and computational overhead for three state-of-the-art neural network coding models instantiated in the two-way paradigm.</description>

      <title>Element-Grouping Strategy for Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a revolutionary paradigm for intelligently controlling wireless channels, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. While IRS-aided communication systems can achieve attractive high channel gains, existing schemes require plenty of IRS elements to mitigate the ``multiplicative fading'' effect in cascaded channels, leading to high complexity for real-time beamforming and high signaling overhead for channel estimation. In this paper, the concept of sustainable intelligent element-grouping IRS (IEG-IRS) is proposed to overcome those fundamental bottlenecks. Specifically, based on the statistical channel state information (S-CSI), the proposed grouping strategy intelligently pre-divide the IEG-IRS elements into multiple groups based on the beam-domain grouping method, with each group sharing the common reflection coefficient and being optimized in real time using the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI). Then, we further analyze the asymptotic performance of the IEG-IRS to reveal the substantial capacity gain in an extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS) aided single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO) system. In particular, when a line-of-sight (LoS) component exists, it demonstrates that the combined cascaded link can be considered as a ``deterministic virtual LoS'' channel, resulting in a sustainable squared array gain achieved by the IEG-IRS. Finally, we formulate a weighted-sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem for an IEG-IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the beam-domain grouping strategy and the multi-user active-passive beamforming is proposed.</description>

      <title>Joint Security-Latency Design for Short Packet-Based Low-Altitude Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a joint security and latency analysis of short packet-based low-altitude communications when the eavesdropper is close to the receiver is addressed. To reveal the impacts of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and block-length on latency in communications, we propose a new metric named secure latency (SL) and derive the expressions for the effective secure probability (ESP) and the average SL. To minimize the average SL, different transmission designs are analyzed, in which the optimal solutions of SNR and block-length are provided. Numerical results validate our analysis and reveal the trade-off between reliability and security and the impacts of the block-length, SNR, and packet-generating rate on average SL, of which SNR and the block-length account for main factors. In addition, we find that the performance of SL can be enhanced by allocating less SNR.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Transmission of Zak-OTFS with Spread Pilots on Sub-THz Communications Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looking towards 6G wireless systems, frequency bands like the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) band (100 GHz - 300 GHz) are gaining traction for their promises of large available swaths of bandwidth to support the ever-growing data demands. However, challenges with harsh channel conditions and hardware nonlinearities in the sub-THz band require robust communication techniques with favorable properties, such as good spectral efficiency and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Recently, OTFS and its variants have garnered significant attention for their performance in severe conditions (like high delay and Doppler), making it a promising candidate for future communications. In this work, we implement Zak-OTFS for the over-the-air experiments with traditional point pilots and the new spread pilots. Notably, we design our spread-pilot waveforms with communications and sensing coexisting in the same radio resources. We define the system model and the signal design for integration onto our state-of-the-art sub-THz wireless testbed. We show successful data transmission over-the-air at 140 GHz and 240 GHz in a variety of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, we demonstrate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities and show PAPR improvement of over 5 dB with spread pilots compared to point pilots.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient SIM-assisted Communications: How Many Layers Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), comprising multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, is becoming an increasingly viable solution for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the integration of SIM in a multi-antenna base station for application to downlink multi-user communications, and a realistic power consumption model for SIM-assisted systems is presented. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) for hybrid precoding design, i.e., the base station digital precoding and SIM wave-based beamforming. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, we employ the quadratic transformation method to reformulate the optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint precoding framework. Specifically, a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is adopted for the base station precoding design. For the SIM wave-based beamforming, two algorithms are employed: the high-performance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the low-complexity projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. In particular, the results indicate that while the optimal number of SIM layers for maximizing the EE and spectral efficiency differs, a design of 2 to 5 layers can achieve satisfactory performance for both. Finally, numerical results are illustrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding framework and to showcase the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>DERD-Net: Learning Depth from Event-based Ray Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

      <title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted MIMO: Electromagnetic-Compliant Modeling with Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent a transformative technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, but it suffers from a significant limitation, namely the double-fading attenuation. Active RIS has emerged as a promising solution, effectively mitigating the attenuation issues associated with conventional RIS-assisted systems. However, the current academic work on active RIS focuses on the system-level optimization of active RIS, often overlooking the development of models that are compatible with its electromagnetic (EM) and physical properties. The challenge of constructing realistic, EM-compliant models for active RIS-assisted communication, as well as understanding their implications on system-level optimization, remains an open research area. To tackle these problems, in this paper we develop a novel EM-compliant model with mutual coupling (MC) for active RIS-assisted wireless systems by integrating the developed scattering-parameter ($S$-parameter) based active RIS framework with multiport network theory, which facilitates system-level analysis and optimization. To evaluate the performance of the EM-compliant active RIS model, we design the joint optimization scheme based on the transmit beamforming at the transmitter and the reflection coefficient at the active RIS to maximize the achievable rate of EM-compliant active RIS-assisted MIMO system. To tackle the inherent non-convexity of this problem, we employ the Sherman-Morrison inversion and Neumann series (SMaN)-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Simulation results verified that EM property (i.e., MC effect) is an indispensable factor in the optimization process of MIMO systems. Neglecting this effect introduces a substantial performance gap, highlighting its significance in the more pronounced the MC effect is, the greater the gap in achievable rates.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Aided Digital Twin Framework for IoT Networks with High Accuracy and Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continued growth of its core technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and data analytics, and edge computing, digital twin (DT) technology has witnessed a significant increase in industrial applications, helping the industry become more sustainable, smart, and adaptable. Hence, DT technology has emerged as a promising link between the physical and virtual worlds, enabling simulation, prediction, and real-time performance optimization. This work aims to explore the development of a high-fidelity digital twin framework, focusing on synchronization and accuracy between physical and digital systems to enhance data-driven decision making. To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs in optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were used to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate their status. We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may monitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are combined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity. The resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the base station, where the DT resides. In this work, we consider a novel metric based on the Age of Information (AoI), coined as the Age of Digital Twin (AoDT), to reflect the status freshness of the digital twin. Factoring AoDT in the problem formulation ensures that the DT reliably mirrors the physical system with high accuracy and synchronization. We formulate a mixed-integer non-convex program to maximize the total amount of data collected from all IoT devices while ensuring a constrained AoDT. Using successive convex approximations, we solve the problem, conduct extensive simulations and compare the results with baseline approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation.</description>

      <title>A Comparative and Measurement-Based Study on Real-Time Network KPI Extraction Methods for 5G and Beyond Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key performance indicators (KPIs), which can be extracted from the standardized interfaces of network equipment defined by current standards, constitute a primary data source that can be leveraged in the development of non-standardized new equipment, architectures, and computational tools. In next-generation technologies, the demand for data has evolved beyond the conventional log generation or export capabilities provided by existing licensed network monitoring tools. There is now a growing need to collect such data at specific time intervals and with defined granularities. At this stage, the development of real-time KPI extraction methods and enabling their exchange between both standardized/commercialized and non-standardized components or tools has become increasingly critical. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of three distinct KPI extraction methodologies applied to two commercially available devices. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths, weaknesses, and overall efficacy of these approaches under varying conditions, and highlights the critical insights into the practical capabilities and limitations. The findings serve as a foundational guide for the seamless integration and robust testing of novel technologies and approaches within commercial telecommunication networks. This work aspires to bridge the gap between technological innovation and real-world applicability, fostering enhanced decision-making in network deployment and optimization.</description>

      <title>A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</description>

      <title>EEG Right &amp; Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00035</link>

Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Federated Learning with Over-the-Air Aggregation: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in wireless computing effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during the analog aggregation process. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of movable antenna (MA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a coordinated approach for uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and MA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of wireless FL training in dynamic wireless environments. This stochastic optimization challenge is reformulated into a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating MA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Unified Near-Field and Far-Field Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Weighted Averaging Over-the-Air Computation and Its Application to Distributed Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-tolerant computing method for over-the-air computation (AirComp) aimed at weighted averaging, which is critical in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional AirComp approaches, while efficient, suffer significantly in accuracy due to noise enhancement in the normalization by the sum of weights. Our proposed method allows nodes to adaptively truncate their weights based on the channel conditions, thereby enhancing noise tolerance. Applied to distributed Gaussian process regression (D-GPR), the method facilitates low-latency, low-complexity, and high-accuracy distributed regression across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a radio map construction problem, which involves visualizing the radio environment based on limited sensing information and spatial interpolation. Numerical results show that our approach maintains computational accuracy in low-SNR scenarios and achieves performance close to ideal conditions in high SNR environments. In addition, a case study targeting a federated learning (FL) system demonstrates the potential of our proposed method in improving model aggregation accuracy, not only for D-GPR but also for FL systems.</description>

      <title>Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. Another contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.</description>

      <title>Radar Code Design for the Joint Optimization of Detection Performance and Measurement Accuracy in Track Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of slow-time coded waveforms which jointly optimize the detection probability and the measurements accuracy for track maintenance in the presence of colored Gaussian interference. The output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and Cram\'er Rao bounds (CRBs) on time delay and Doppler shift are used as figures of merit to accomplish reliable detection as well as accurate measurements. The transmitted code is subject to radar power budget requirements and a similarity constraint. To tackle the resulting non-convex multi-objective optimization problem, a polynomial-time algorithm that integrates scalarization and tensor-based relaxation methods is developed. The corresponding relaxed multi-linear problems are solved by means of the maximum block improvement (MBI) framework, where the optimal solution at each iteration is obtained in closed form. Numeral results demonstrate the trade-off between the detection and the estimation performance, along with the acceptable Doppler robustness achieved by the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the Zero-Shot context), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc interpretation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that maximizes the faithfulness to the original similarity between a given text-and-audio pair. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Task Offloading for Semantic-Aware Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides low-latency offloading solutions for computationally intensive tasks, effectively improving the computing efficiency and battery life of mobile devices. However, for data-intensive tasks or scenarios with limited uplink bandwidth, network congestion might occur due to massive simultaneous offloading nodes, increasing transmission latency and affecting task performance. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading framework to address the challenges posed by limited uplink bandwidth. By introducing a semantic extraction factor, we balance the relationship among transmission latency, computation energy consumption, and task performance. To measure the offloading performance of multi-modal tasks, we design a unified and fair quality of experience (QoE) metric that includes execution latency, energy consumption, and task performance. Lastly, we formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and exploit the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize the semantic extraction factor, communication resources, and computing resources to maximize overall QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in execution latency and energy consumption of 18.1% and 12.9%, respectively compared with the semantic-unaware approach. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to models with different user preferences.</description>

      <title>Onboard Satellite Image Classification for Earth Observation: A Comparative Study of ViT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on identifying the most effective pre-trained model for land use classification in onboard satellite processing, emphasizing achieving high accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against noisy data conditions commonly encountered during satellite-based inference. Through extensive experimentation, we compare the performance of traditional CNN-based, ResNet-based, and various pre-trained vision Transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models, particularly MobileViTV2 and EfficientViT-M2, outperform models trained from scratch in terms of accuracy and efficiency. These models achieve high performance with reduced computational requirements and exhibit greater resilience during inference under noisy conditions. While MobileViTV2 has excelled on clean validation data, EfficientViT-M2 has proved more robust when handling noise, making it the most suitable model for onboard satellite EO tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that EfficientViT-M2 is the optimal choice for reliable and efficient RS-IC in satellite operations, achieving 98.76 % of accuracy, precision, and recall. Precisely, EfficientViT-M2 delivers the highest performance across all metrics, excels in training efficiency (1,000s) and inference time (10s), and demonstrates greater robustness (overall robustness score of 0.79). Consequently, EfficientViT-M2 consumes 63.93 % less power than MobileViTV2 (79.23 W) and 73.26 % less power than SwinTransformer (108.90 W). This highlights its significant advantage in energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for the Hadamard decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.</description>
