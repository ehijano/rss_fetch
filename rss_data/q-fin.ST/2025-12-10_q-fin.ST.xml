      <title>Integrating LSTM Networks with Neural Levy Processes for Financial Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an optimal integration of deep learning with financial models for robust asset price forecasting. Specifically, we developed a hybrid framework combining a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with the Merton-L\'evy jump-diffusion model. To optimise this framework, we employed the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for the LSTM hyperparameter tuning, and we explored three calibration methods for the Merton-Levy model parameters: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), and the PyTorch-based TorchSDE library. To evaluate the predictive performance of our hybrid model, we compared it against several benchmark models, including a standard LSTM and an LSTM combined with the Fractional Heston model. This evaluation used three real-world financial datasets: Brent oil prices, the STOXX 600 index, and the IT40 index. Performance was assessed using standard metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Percentage Error (MSPE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). Our experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model, combining a GWO-optimized LSTM network with the Levy-Merton Jump-Diffusion model calibrated using an ANN, outperformed the base LSTM model and all other models developed in this study.</description>

      <title>The Endogenous Constraint: Hysteresis, Stagflation, and the Structural Inhibition of Monetary Velocity in the Bitcoin Network (2016-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin operates as a macroeconomic paradox: it combines a strictly predetermined, inelastic monetary issuance schedule with a stochastic, highly elastic demand for scarce block space. This paper empirically validates the Endogenous Constraint Hypothesis, positing that protocol-level throughput limits generate a non-linear negative feedback loop between network friction and base-layer monetary velocity. Using a verified Transaction Cost Index (TCI) derived from Blockchain.com on-chain data and Hansen's (2000) threshold regression, we identify a definitive structural break at the 90th percentile of friction (TCI ~ 1.63). The analysis reveals a bifurcation in network utility: while the network exhibits robust velocity growth of +15.44% during normal regimes, this collapses to +6.06% during shock regimes, yielding a statistically significant Net Utility Contraction of -9.39% (p = 0.012). Crucially, Instrumental Variable (IV) tests utilizing Hashrate Variation as a supply-side instrument fail to detect a significant relationship in a linear specification (p=0.196), confirming that the velocity constraint is strictly a regime-switching phenomenon rather than a continuous linear function. Furthermore, we document a "Crypto Multiplier" inversion: high friction correlates with a +8.03% increase in capital concentration per entity, suggesting that congestion forces a substitution from active velocity to speculative hoarding.</description>

      <title>Does it take two to tango: Interaction between Credit Default Swaps and National Stock Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates both short and long-run interaction between BIST-100 index and CDS prices over January 2008 to May 2015 using ARDL technique. The paper documents several findings. First, ARDL analysis shows that 1 TL increase in CDS shrinks BIST-100 index by 22.5 TL in short-run and 85.5 TL in long-run. Second, 1000 TL increase in BIST index price causes 25 TL and 44 TL reducation in Turkey's CDS prices in short- and long-run respectively. Third, a percentage increase in interest rate shrinks BIST index by 359 TL and a percentage increase in inflation rate scales CDS prices up to 13.34 TL both in long-run. In case of short-run, these impacts are limited with 231 TL and 5.73 TL respectively. Fourth, a kurush increase in TL/USD exchange rate leads 24.5 TL (short-run) and 78 TL (long-run) reductions in BIST, while it augments CDS prices by 2.5 TL (short-run) and 3 TL (long-run) respectively. Fifth, each negative political events decreases BIST by 237 TL in short-run and 538 TL in long-run, while it increases CDS prices by 33 TL in short-run and 89 TL in long-run. These findings imply the highly dollar indebted capital structure of Turkish firms, and overly sensitivity of financial markets to the uncertainties in political sphere. Finally, the paper provides evidence for that BIST and CDS with control variables drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a moderate monthly speed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Contagion in China's Stock Market: A Hawkes Process Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores contagion in the Chinese stock market using Hawkes processes to analyze autocorrelation and cross-correlation in multivariate time series data. We examine whether market indices exhibit trending behavior and whether sector indices influence one another. By fitting self-exciting and inhibitory Hawkes processes to daily returns of indices like the Shanghai Composite, Shenzhen Component, and ChiNext, as well as sector indices (CSI Consumer, Healthcare, and Financial), we identify long- term dependencies and trending patterns, including upward, downward, and over- sold rebound trends. Results show that during high trading activity, sector indices tend to sustain their trends, while low activity periods exhibit strong sector rotation. This research models stock price movements using spatiotemporal Hawkes processes, leveraging conditional intensity functions to explain sector rotation, advancing the understanding of financial contagion.</description>

      <title>RAG-IT: Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning for Automated Financial Analysis - A Case Study for the Semiconductor Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08179</link>

Abstract: Financial analysis relies heavily on the interpretation of earnings reports to assess company performance and guide decision-making. Traditional methods for generating such analyzes require significant financial expertise and are often time-consuming. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), domain-specific adaptations have emerged for financial tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition. This paper introduces RAG-IT (Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning), a novel framework designed to automate the generation of earnings report analysis through an LLM fine-tuned specifically for the financial domain. Our approach integrates retrieval augmentation with instruction-based fine-tuning to enhance factual accuracy, contextual relevance, and domain adaptability. We construct a sector-specific financial instruction dataset derived from semiconductor industry documents to guide the LLM adaptation to specialized financial reasoning. Using NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom as representative companies, our case study demonstrates that RAG-IT substantially improves a general-purpose open-source LLM and achieves performance comparable to commercial systems like GPT-3.5 on financial report generation tasks. This research highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented instruction tuning to streamline and elevate financial analysis automation, advancing the broader field of intelligent financial reporting.</description>
