      <title>Dual-frequency Doppler-free crossover resonance with suppressed magnetic-field sensitivity for compact optical frequency standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation and characterization of a high-contrast dual-frequency Doppler-free ground-state crossover resonance in the D1 line of 87Rb.The crossover appears at a two-photon detuning exceeding the natural linewidth of the excited state and is formed by the optical pumping effect. Unlike the previously proposed resonance at zero two-photon detuning, which we show becomes sensitive to magnetic-field fluctuations due to residual ellipticity of the optical fields-resulting in frequency shifts and profile asymmetry-the crossover resonance is largely immune to this effect. Our theoretical analysis attributes the observed sensitivity to the dispersive contribution of ground-state coherences to absorption. Stability measurements under magnetic-field fluctuations demonstrate that using the crossover resonance provides more than an order-of-magnitude improvement, making it a promising reference for frequency stabilization in compact, field-deployable optical standards.</description>

      <title>Multipole transition amplitudes and radiative decay rates in neutral cadmium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the electronic transitions in neutral cadmium (Cd I) with a focus on forbidden transitions, motivated by recent advances in laser technology and the growing relevance of cadmium in quantum gas research, precision metrology, and atom trapping. General analytic expressions are derived for transition matrix elements of all multipolar orders, formulated to be applicable for experimental use. Using configuration interaction combined with many-body perturbation theory, we calculate not only the previously reported contributions from electric dipole (E1) transitions, but also the electric quadrupole (E2), electric octupole (E3), magnetic dipole (M1), and magnetic quadrupole transitions (M2) that have not yet been investigated for cadmium. These matrix elements are then employed to determine the lifetimes of key excited states, particularly those pertinent to laser cooling and optical frequency standards, and to evaluate the long-range dispersion coefficient C6. The linewidths of the strongest transitions, along with the atomic energy levels, are compared with available experimental data to validate the accuracy of the simulations. Overall, the results are in good agreement, with the calculated energy levels exhibiting an average relative deviation of 0.3% from experiments. These values serve as benchmarks for both bosonic and fermionic isotopes, providing a foundation for future experimental and theoretical work in cadmium-based precision spectroscopy and cold-collision studies.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-amplified global-phase spectroscopy on an optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.</description>

      <title>The role of spectator modes in the quantum-logic spectroscopy of single trapped molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-logic spectroscopy has become an increasingly important tool for the state detection and readout of trapped atomic and molecular ions which do not possess easily accessible closed-cycling optical transitions. In this approach, the internal state of the target ion is mapped onto a co-trapped auxiliary ion. This mapping is typically mediated by normal modes of motion of the two-ion Coulomb crystal in the trap. The present study investigates the role of spectator modes not directly involved in a measurement protocol relying on a state-dependent optical-dipole force. We identify a Debye-Waller-type effect that modifies the response of the two-ion string to the force. We show that cooling the spectator modes of the string allows for the detection of the rovibrational ground state of an N$_2^+$ molecular ion with a computed statistical fidelity exceeding 99.99%, improving on previous experiments by more than an order of magnitude while also halving the experimental time. This enhanced sensitivity enables the simultaneous identification of multiple rotational states with markedly weaker signals.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <title>Wavelength dependence of laser pulse filamentation in the close spectral vicinity of atomic resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation and nonlinear self-focusing of TW power laser pulses that create 10-m-scale, highly homogeneous plasma channels in rubidium vapor. Using computational solutions of the relevant propagation equations, we study the effects of the ionizing pulse central wavelength in relation to the resonance frequencies of atomic rubidium. Recent experiments show that pulse propagation and plasma channel creation is distinctly different for 780 nm laser pulses (resonant with the rubidium $D_2$ line) and 810 nm laser pulses. We study pulse propagation in a $\pm$30 nm range around the $D_2$ resonance and find that the results are distinctly different when tuning to sub-resonant wavelengths from those obtained for super-resonant wavelengths. For pulse wavelengths below the resonance the behavior is similar to the resonant case, characterized by strong self-focusing and a sharp plasma boundary. Pulse wavelengths above 780 nm on the other hand yield gradually weaker self-focusing and an increasingly diffuse plasma boundary. Our results suggest that the observed behavior can be attributed to an interplay between multiple factors: anomalous dispersion around atomic resonances, resonant transitions between excited states of Rb lying in the 740-780 nm range and wavelength-dependent multiphoton ionization rates.</description>

      <title>Ionization of atoms by dense and compact beams of extreme relativistic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionization is one of the basic physical processes, occurring when charged particles penetrate atomic matter. When atoms are bombarded by very dense and compact beams of extreme relativistic electrons, two qualitatively new -- and very efficient -- ionization mechanisms arise: the tunnel or over-barrier ionization and the coherent impact ionization, which are driven by the low- and high-frequency parts, respectively, of the beam field. In these mechanisms significant fractions of the beam electrons act coherently, strongly enhancing the ionization process. They are also very sensitive to the spatiotemporal structure of the beam that can be used for analysing the beam properties.</description>

      <title>Probing new hadronic forces with heavy exotic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of precision spectroscopy of heavy exotic atoms where electrons are substituted by negative hadrons to detect new force carriers with hadronic couplings. The selected transitions are unaffected by nuclear contact terms, thus enabling highly accurate calculations using bound-state QED, provided that the nuclear polarization is under control. Alternatively, we demonstrate that the dipole polarizability, a fundamental property of nuclei, can be extracted from the spectroscopy of exotic atoms in a novel way by combining two transitions while maintaining high sensitivity to new physics. Based on existing data, we extracted world-leading bounds on mediator masses ranging from $0.1\,$MeV to $10\,$MeV for two benchmark models and show that forthcoming experiments could enhance the sensitivity to new physics by two orders of magnitude.</description>
