      <title>Veering triangulations and transverse foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial approach to the existence of foliations and contact structures transverse to a given pseudo-Anosov flow. Let $\varphi$ be a transitive pseudo-Anosov flow on a closed oriented 3-manifold. Our main technical result is that every codimension 1 foliation transverse to $\varphi$ is carried by a single branched surface coming from a veering triangulation. Combined with recent breakthrough work of Massoni, this reduces the existence problem for transverse foliations to something like the feasibility of a system of inequalities (rather than equations!) over $Homeo_+([0,1])$. As a proof of concept, we show that for the hyperbolic, fibered, non-L-space knot $10_{145}$, the natural pseudo-Anosov flow on the slope $s$ Dehn surgery admits a transverse foliation for $s\in (-\infty, 3)$, but does not admit such a foliation for $s\in [5,\infty)$. The negative result is part of a more general Milnor--Wood type phenomenon which puts limitations on some well known methods for constructing taut foliations on Dehn surgeries.</description>

      <title>Lifting criteria of closed curves on surfaces to finite covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lifts of the closed curves in the bouquet of $n$ circles to a finite sheeted normal covering. For a class of normal covers, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed curve to lift. As a consequence, we prove that a free group with $n$ $ (\geq 2)$ generators can be written as the union of subgroups of index $l$ where $l=2,3$.</description>

      <title>Stabilizations of $s$-cobordisms of dimension $5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the $s$-cobordism theorem fails for $5$-dimensional $s$-cobordisms. In this article we study how many times of "stabilizations" are needed to turn a $5$-dimensional $s$-cobordism to a product cobordism. The question is analogous to asking how many times of stabilizations are needed to turn an exotic pair of four manifolds into diffeomorphic ones. The main tools in this article are Gabai's $4$D light bulb theorem and its applications, and we also use a refinement of $4$D light bulb theorem by Freedman Quinn invariant.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the growth rates for the set of reciprocal conjugacy classes in the Hecke groups. In other words, this estimates the growth of the reciprocal geodesics in terms of word lengths on the hyperbolic orbifolds associated with the Hecke groups.</description>

      <title>The Disc-structure space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Disc-structure space $S^{\rm Disc}_\partial(M)$ of a compact smooth manifold $M$. Informally speaking, this space measures the difference between $M$, together with its diffeomorphisms, and the diagram of ordered framed configuration spaces of $M$ with point-forgetting and point-splitting maps between them, together with its derived automorphisms. As the main results, we show that in high dimensions, the Disc-structure space a) only depends on the tangential 2-type of $M$, b) is an infinite loop space, and c) is nontrivial as long as $M$ is spin. The proofs involve intermediate results that may be of independent interest, including an enhancement of embedding calculus to the level of bordism categories, results on the behaviour of derived mapping spaces between operads under rationalisation, and an answer to a question of Dwyer and Hess in that we show that the map ${\rm BTop}(d)\to {\rm BAut}(E_d)$ is an equivalence if and only if $d$ is at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Metric Space Magnitude for Evaluating the Diversity of Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitude of a metric space is a novel invariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' of a space across multiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, such as curvature, density, or entropy. We develop a family of magnitude-based measures of the intrinsic diversity of latent representations, formalising a novel notion of dissimilarity between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces. Our measures are provably stable under perturbations of the data, can be efficiently calculated, and enable a rigorous multi-scale characterisation and comparison of latent representations. We show their utility and superior performance across different domains and tasks, including (i) the automated estimation of diversity, (ii) the detection of mode collapse, and (iii) the evaluation of generative models for text, image, and graph data.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple Crane-Yetter theory varying over the character stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility echoes -- recovers and greatly generalizes -- the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure.</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-isotopic unit conormal bundles in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any compact connected submanifold $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\Lambda_K$ denote its unit conormal bundle, which is a Legendrian submanifold of the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we give examples of pairs $(K_0,K_1)$ of compact connected submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\Lambda_{K_0}$ is not Legendrian isotopic to $\Lambda_{K_1}$, although they cannot be distinguished by classical invariants. Here, $K_1$ is the image of an embedding $\iota_f \colon K_0 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is regular homotopic to the inclusion map of $K_0$ and the codimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is greater than or equal to $4$. As non-classical invariants, we define the strip Legendrian contact homology and a coproduct on it under certain conditions on Legendrian submanifolds. Then, we give a purely topological description of these invariants for $\Lambda_K$ when the codimension of $K$ is greater than or equal to $4$. The main examples $\Lambda_{K_0}$ and $\Lambda_{K_1}$ are distinguished by the coproduct, which is computed by using an idea of string topology.</description>
