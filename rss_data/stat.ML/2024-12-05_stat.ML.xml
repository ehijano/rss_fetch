      <title>Universal Rates of Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle is the basis of many widely used machine learning algorithms, and plays an essential role in the classical PAC theory. A common description of a learning algorithm's performance is its so-called "learning curve", that is, the decay of the expected error as a function of the input sample size. As the PAC model fails to explain the behavior of learning curves, recent research has explored an alternative universal learning model and has ultimately revealed a distinction between optimal universal and uniform learning rates (Bousquet et al., 2021). However, a basic understanding of such differences with a particular focus on the ERM principle has yet to be developed.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM in the realizable case and study the possible universal rates. Our main result is a fundamental tetrachotomy: there are only four possible universal learning rates by ERM, namely, the learning curves of any concept class learnable by ERM decay either at $e^{-n}$, $1/n$, $\log(n)/n$, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories, via new complexity structures. We also develop new combinatorial dimensions which supply sharp asymptotically-valid constant factors for these rates, whenever possible.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic bandit problems, where the agent receives binary rewards with probabilities determined by a logistic function $\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle)/(1+\exp(\beta \langle a, \theta \rangle))$. We focus on the setting where the action $a$ and parameter $\theta$ lie within the $d$-dimensional unit ball with the action space encompassing the parameter space. Adopting the information-theoretic framework introduced by (Russo $\&amp;$ Van Roy, 2015), we analyze the information ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the expected squared difference between the optimal and actual rewards to the mutual information between the optimal action and the reward. Improving upon previous results, we establish that the information ratio is bounded by $\tfrac{9}{2}d$. Notably, we obtain a regret bound in $O(d\sqrt{T \log(\beta T/d)})$ that depends only logarithmically on the parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Preference-based Pure Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the preference-based pure exploration problem for bandits with vector-valued rewards. The rewards are ordered using a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$ and our the goal is to identify the set of Pareto optimal arms. First, to quantify the impact of preferences, we derive a novel lower bound on the sample complexity for identifying the most preferred policy with confidence level $1-\delta$. Our lower bound elicits the role played by the geometry of the preference cone and punctuates the difference in hardness compared to existing best-arm identification variants of the problem. We further explicate this geometry when rewards follow Gaussian distributions. We then provide a convex relaxation of the lower bound. and leverage it to design Preference-based Track and Stop (PreTS) algorithm that identifies the most preferred policy. Finally, we show that sample complexity of PreTS is asymptotically tight by deriving a new concentration inequality for vector-valued rewards.</description>

      <title>Generalized Diffusion Model with Adjusted Offset Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become fundamental tools for modeling data distributions in machine learning and have applications in image generation, drug discovery, and audio synthesis. Despite their success, these models face challenges when generating data with extreme brightness values, as evidenced by limitations in widely used frameworks like Stable Diffusion. Offset noise has been proposed as an empirical solution to this issue, yet its theoretical basis remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a generalized diffusion model that naturally incorporates additional noise within a rigorous probabilistic framework. Our approach modifies both the forward and reverse diffusion processes, enabling inputs to be diffused into Gaussian distributions with arbitrary mean structures. We derive a loss function based on the evidence lower bound, establishing its theoretical equivalence to offset noise with certain adjustments, while broadening its applicability. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our model effectively addresses brightness-related challenges and outperforms conventional methods in high-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Beyond algorithm hyperparameters: on preprocessing hyperparameters and associated pitfalls in machine learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adequately generating and evaluating prediction models based on supervised machine learning (ML) is often challenging, especially for less experienced users in applied research areas. Special attention is required in settings where the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e. data-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning typically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum number of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In this context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the preprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the algorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a consequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to improve model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of hyperparameter tuning - albeit informal and unsystematic - and thus may fail to report or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper reviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and evaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways algorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML users. By highlighting potential pitfalls, especially those that may lead to exaggerated performance claims, this review aims to further improve the quality of predictive modeling in ML applications.</description>

      <title>Self-test loss functions for learning weak-form operators and gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of loss functions presents a major challenge in data-driven modeling involving weak-form operators in PDEs and gradient flows, particularly due to the need to select test functions appropriately. We address this challenge by introducing self-test loss functions, which employ test functions that depend on the unknown parameters, specifically for cases where the operator depends linearly on the unknowns. The proposed self-test loss function conserves energy for gradient flows and coincides with the expected log-likelihood ratio for stochastic differential equations. Importantly, it is quadratic, facilitating theoretical analysis of identifiability and well-posedness of the inverse problem, while also leading to efficient parametric or nonparametric regression algorithms. It is computationally simple, requiring only low-order derivatives or even being entirely derivative-free, and numerical experiments demonstrate its robustness against noisy and discrete data.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>Path-Guided Particle-based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-based Bayesian inference methods by sampling from a partition-free target (posterior) distribution, e.g., Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), have attracted significant attention. We propose a path-guided particle-based sampling~(PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage (LwS) density path linking an initial distribution to the target distribution. We propose to utilize a Neural network to learn a vector field motivated by the Fokker-Planck equation of the designed density path. Particles, initiated from the initial distribution, evolve according to the ordinary differential equation defined by the vector field. The distribution of these particles is guided along a density path from the initial distribution to the target distribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient search of modes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically analyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated samples and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization errors. Practically, the proposed PGPS-LwS method demonstrates higher Bayesian inference accuracy and better calibration ability in experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world Bayesian learning tasks, compared to baselines, such as SVGD and Langevin dynamics, etc.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Tensor Ring Factorization for Multiway Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor decompositions play a crucial role in numerous applications related to multi-way data analysis. By employing a Bayesian framework with sparsity-inducing priors, Bayesian Tensor Ring (BTR) factorization offers probabilistic estimates and an effective approach for automatically adapting the tensor ring rank during the learning process. However, previous BTR method employs an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) prior, which can lead to sub-optimal solutions. Besides, it solely focuses on continuous data, whereas many applications involve discrete data. More importantly, it relies on the Coordinate-Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm, which is inadequate for handling large tensors with extensive observations. These limitations greatly limit its application scales and scopes, making it suitable only for small-scale problems, such as image/video completion. To address these issues, we propose a novel BTR model that incorporates a nonparametric Multiplicative Gamma Process (MGP) prior, known for its superior accuracy in identifying latent structures. To handle discrete data, we introduce the P\'olya-Gamma augmentation for closed-form updates. Furthermore, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler for consistent posterior simulation, which reduces the computational complexity of previous VI algorithm by two orders, and an online EM algorithm that is scalable to extremely large tensors. To showcase the advantages of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on both simulation data and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Classical Shadows with Improved Median-of-Means Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical shadows protocol, introduced by Huang et al. [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], makes use of the median-of-means (MoM) estimator to efficiently estimate the expectation values of $M$ observables with failure probability $\delta$ using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(M/\delta))$ measurements. In their analysis, Huang et al. used loose constants in their asymptotic performance bounds for simplicity. However, the specific values of these constants can significantly affect the number of shots used in practical implementations. To address this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker [PMLR 195, 5925 (2023)] that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over the data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete U-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second based on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the original and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol with single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin chain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. While the original estimator outperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified estimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to specific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical shadows protocol in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Bounds in Wasserstein distance for locally stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally stationary processes (LSPs) provide a robust framework for modeling time-varying phenomena, allowing for smooth variations in statistical properties such as mean and variance over time. In this paper, we address the estimation of the conditional probability distribution of LSPs using Nadaraya-Watson (NW) type estimators. The NW estimator approximates the conditional distribution of a target variable given covariates through kernel smoothing techniques. We establish the convergence rate of the NW conditional probability estimator for LSPs in the univariate setting under the Wasserstein distance and extend this analysis to the multivariate case using the sliced Wasserstein distance. Theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical usefulness of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>A Penalized Shared-parameter Algorithm for Estimating Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic treatment regimen (DTR) is a set of decision rules to personalize treatments for an individual using their medical history. The Q-learning-based Q-shared algorithm has been used to develop DTRs that involve decision rules shared across multiple stages of intervention. We show that the existing Q-shared algorithm can suffer from non-convergence due to the use of linear models in the Q-learning setup, and identify the condition under which Q-shared fails. We develop a penalized Q-shared algorithm that not only converges in settings that violate the condition, but can outperform the original Q-shared algorithm even when the condition is satisfied. We give evidence for the proposed method in a real-world application and several synthetic simulations.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces the first toolkit around path-norms that fully encompasses general DAG ReLU networks with biases, skip connections and any operation based on the extraction of order statistics: max pooling, GroupSort etc. This toolkit notably allows us to establish generalization bounds for modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type. These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved sharpness on layered fully-connected networks compared to the product of operator norms, another complexity measure most commonly used.
  The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for $k$-NN Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a fast computation method for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$-NN) regression. We show that, under a tie-breaking condition for nearest neighbours, the LOOCV estimate of the mean square error for $k$-NN regression is identical to the mean square error of $(k+1)$-NN regression evaluated on the training data, multiplied by the scaling factor $(k+1)^2/k^2$. Therefore, to compute the LOOCV score, one only needs to fit $(k+1)$-NN regression only once, and does not need to repeat training-validation of $k$-NN regression for the number of training data. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the fast computation method.</description>

      <title>Towards Size-Independent Generalization Bounds for Deep Operator Nets</title>

Abstract: In recent times machine learning methods have made significant advances in becoming a useful tool for analyzing physical systems. A particularly active area in this theme has been "physics-informed machine learning" which focuses on using neural nets for numerically solving differential equations. In this work, we aim to advance the theory of measuring out-of-sample error while training DeepONets - which is among the most versatile ways to solve P.D.E systems in one-shot. Firstly, for a class of DeepONets, we prove a bound on their Rademacher complexity which does not explicitly scale with the width of the nets involved. Secondly, we use this to show how the Huber loss can be chosen so that for these DeepONet classes generalization error bounds can be obtained that have no explicit dependence on the size of the nets. The effective capacity measure for DeepONets that we thus derive is also shown to correlate with the behavior of generalization error in experiments.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for learning with real and surrogate data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data as `surrogate data'. We study a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable uncertainty quantification with neural network ensembles for industrial image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.</description>

      <title>Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Stratified Prediction-Powered Inference for Hybrid Language Model Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a method that improves statistical estimates based on limited human-labeled data. PPI achieves this by combining small amounts of human-labeled data with larger amounts of data labeled by a reasonably accurate -- but potentially biased -- automatic system, in a way that results in tighter confidence intervals for certain parameters of interest (e.g., the mean performance of a language model). In this paper, we propose a method called Stratified Prediction-Powered Inference (StratPPI), in which we show that the basic PPI estimates can be considerably improved by employing simple data stratification strategies. Without making any assumptions on the underlying automatic labeling system or data distribution, we derive an algorithm for computing provably valid confidence intervals for population parameters (such as averages) that is based on stratified sampling. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that, with appropriate choices of stratification and sample allocation, our approach can provide substantially tighter confidence intervals than unstratified approaches. Specifically, StratPPI is expected to improve in cases where the performance of the autorater varies across different conditional distributions of the target data.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of finding the index of the minimum value of a vector from noisy observations. This problem is relevant in population/policy comparison, discrete maximum likelihood, and model selection. We develop an asymptotically normal test statistic, even in high-dimensional settings and with potentially many ties in the population mean vector, by integrating concepts and tools from cross-validation and differential privacy. The key technical ingredient is a central limit theorem for globally dependent data. We also propose practical ways to select the tuning parameter that adapts to the signal landscape. Numerical experiments and data examples demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn a priori unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across the model weights. Recent works focus on different initialization schemes or the learning of adaptive ranks during fine-tuning. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to suboptimal performance. We propose to improve LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and redistribute ranks among all weight matrices to provably store the maximum amount of information of the downstream data in the newly introduced weights. In this way, only what information to maintain or neglect during the fine-tuning process needs to be learned. We call our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds and Model Complexity for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Representation and Model Learning for Latent Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations is helpful for an intelligent spacecraft to complete downstream tasks reliably. For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent or require that the interventions can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice, the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent dynamic systems. The key idea is to use an inductive bias inspired by controllable canonical forms, which are sparse and input-dependent by definition. We prove that, for linear and affine nonlinear latent dynamic systems with sparse input matrices, it is possible to identify the latent variables up to scaling and determine the dynamic models up to some simple transformations. The results have the potential to provide some theoretical guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods for intelligent spacecrafts.</description>

      <title>Self-Improvement in Language Models: The Sharpening Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of self-improvement, where a language models evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample access, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families of self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the SFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient coverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based self-improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for coverage. Finally, we empirically validate the sharpening mechanism via inference-time and amortization experiments. We view these findings as a starting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design and evaluation of self-improvement algorithms.</description>
