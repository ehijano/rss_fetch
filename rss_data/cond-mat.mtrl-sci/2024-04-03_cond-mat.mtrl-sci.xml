      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Graphene through BN-ring Doping: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has been widely studied for various applications due to its outstanding electrical and mechanical properties. However, its potential in thermoelectric applications has been limited by a low Seebeck coefficient and high thermal conductivity. Efforts to enhance its thermoelectric properties have involved the usage of carbon-based nanoribbons, strain engineering, and heteroatom co-doping, particularly with Nitrogen and/or Boron atoms. In this work, multiscale simulation approaches combining DFT calculations and semi-empirical models are used to explore the potential improvement of the thermoelectric properties via borazine (B$_3$N$_3$)-ring doping. As bandgap engineering can be obtained with this doping, the thermoelectric properties of graphene are significantly enlarged, albeit at the cost of reduced conductance. The effects observed are not only dependent on the concentration of BN within the graphene lattice but are also notably influenced by the relative rotational alignment of the BN rings. Furthermore, the effect of the distribution and rotational disorder are considered, showing reduced electronic conductance compared to the periodic case highlighting the importance of precise control over the doping parameters of BN-ring. Lastly, the thermal lattice conductance is estimated revealing a substantial reduction of up to 40$\%$ compared to pristine graphene opening up the possibility of enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency of BNC materials. The present theoretical approach highlights how BN-ring doping can refine the thermoelectric properties of 2D graphene, offering a pathway for enhancing its suitability in practical thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Berry Phase and Half-Metallicity in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ in Response to Strain, Filling, Thickness, and Surface Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is a ferromagnetic, quasi-two-dimensional layered material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, strong spin-orbit coupling, and non-trivial band topology. The non-trivial topology results in an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) that switches sign under filling and biaxial strain. Thin films can exhibit half metallicity. Using density functional theory combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, we reveal the physical origins of the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC to strain and filling, and we determine the effect of surface termination on the half metallicity. We find that thin films terminated on the Te layers are the most energetically stable, but only the thin films terminated on both sides with the partially occupied Cr layers are half metals. In bulk Cr$_2$Te$_3$, the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC to strain and filling results from the complex Fermi surface comprised of three bands. Filling of local minima and bands near anti-crossings alters the local Berry curvature consistent with the negative to positive switching of the AHC. Similarly, strain depopulates a local minimum, shifts a degenerate point closer to the Fermi energy, and causes two spin-orbit split bands to reverse their order. These findings provide a physical understanding of the evolution of the Berry phase, AHC, and half-metallicity in Cr$_2$Te$_3$.</description>

      <title>High-throughput calculations of antiferromagnets hosting anomalous transport phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a high-throughput computational scheme based on cluster multipole theory to identify new functional antiferromagnets. This approach is applied to 228 magnetic compounds listed in the AtomWork-Adv database, known for their elevated N\'eel temperatures. We conduct systematic investigations of both stable and metastable magnetic configurations of these materials. Our findings reveal that 34 of these compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic structures with zero propagation vectors and magnetic symmetries identical to conventional ferromagnets, rendering them potentially invaluable for spintronics applications. By cross-referencing our predictions with the existing MAGNDATA database and published literature, we verify the reliability of our findings for 26 out of 28 compounds with partially or fully elucidated magnetic structures in the experiments. These results not only affirm the reliability of our scheme but also point to its potential for broader applicability in the ongoing quest for the discovery of new functional magnets.13</description>

      <title>Occurrence of the collective Ziman limit of heat transport in cubic semiconductors: scattering channels and size effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the possibility of reaching the Ziman conditions for collective heat transport in cubic bulk semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, AlAs and AlP. In natural and enriched silicon and germanium, the collective heat transport limit is impossible to reach due to strong isotopic scattering. However, we show that in hyperenriched silicon and germanium, as well as in materials with one single stable isotope like AlAs and AlP, at low temperatures, normal scattering plays an important role, making the observation of the collective heat transport possible. We further discuss the effects of sample sizes, and analyse our results for cubic materials by comparing them to bulk bismuth, in which second sound has been detected at cryogenic temperatures. We find that collective heat transport in cubic semiconductors studied in this work is expected to occur at temperatures between 10 and 20 K.</description>

      <title>Crystallographic dependence of Field Evaporation Energy Barrier in metals using Field Evaporation Energy Loss Spectroscopy mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom probe tomography data is composed of a list of coordinates of the reconstructed atoms in the probed volume. The elemental identity of each atom is derived from time-of-flight mass spectrometry, with no local energetic or chemical information readily available within the mass spectrum. Here, we used a new data processing technique referred to as field evaporation energy loss spectroscopy (FEELS), which analyses the tails of mass peaks. FEELS was used to extract critical energetic parameters that characterize the field evaporation process, which are related to the binding energy of atoms to the surface under intense electrostatic field and dependent of the path followed by the departing atoms during the field evaporation process. We focused our study on different pure face centered cubic metals (Al, Ni, Rh). We demonstrate that the energetic parameters extracted from mass spectra can be mapped in 2D with nanometric resolution. A dependence on the considered crystallographic planes is observed, with sets of planes of low Miller indices showing a lower sensitivity to the intensity of the electric field, which indicates a lower effective attachment energy. The temperature is also an important parameter in particular for Al, which we attribute to an energetic transition between two paths of field evaporation between 25K and 60K close to (002) pole at the specimen's surface. This paper shows that the complex information that can be retrieved from the measured energy loss of surface atoms is important both instrumentally and fundamentally.</description>

      <title>Wenzhou TE: a first-principles calculated thermoelectric materials database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the implementation of the Materials Genome Project by the Obama administration in the United States, the development of various computational materials databases has fundamentally expanded the choices of industries such as materials and energy. In the field of thermoelectric materials, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT quantifies the performance of the material. From the viewpoint of calculations for vast materials, the ZT values are not easily obtained due to their computational complexity. Here, we show how to build a database of thermoelectric materials based on first-principles calculations for the electronic and heat transport of materials. Firstly, the initial structures are classified according to the values of bandgap and other basic properties using the clustering algorithm K-means in machine learning, and high-throughput first principles calculations are carried out for narrow-bandgap semiconductors which exhibiting potential thermoelectric application. The present framework of calculations mainly includes deformation potential module, electrical transport performance module, mechanical and thermodynamic properties module. We have also set up a search webpage for the calculated database of thermoelectric materials, providing searching and viewing the related physical properties of materials. Our work may inspire the construction of more computational databases of first-principle thermoelectric materials and accelerate research progress in the field of thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Monoatomic Vacancies in 2D Materials on the Performance of Magnetic Tunnel Junction Devices: Insights from Configurations and Interface Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of monoatomic vacancies in 2D materials on the performance of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices using first-principles calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT). Specifically, we analyze the influence on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with various layer configurations, uncovering distinct transmission probability patterns. Transmission calculations were conducted using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula employing the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method. In the Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN/Ni system, a significant reduction in transmission probability was observed compared to non-vacancy configurations. However, when two hBN vacancies were considered, creating the Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN(V$_B$)/Ni MTJ system, a new transmission channel mediated by vacancy localized states emerged. The introduction of a monoatomic boron vacancy in the middle hBN layer of the Ni/3hBN/Ni system revealed nuanced effects on the transmission probability, highlighting alterations in the spin minority and majority channels. Additionally, we explore the monoatomic vacancy in the graphene layer in the Ni/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni MTJ, uncovering a unique transmission channel influenced by the proximity effect. Our findings suggest that the creation of monoatomic vacancies on the insulator barrier of 2D materials induces distinctive characteristics shaped by the interaction between the surface state of the electrode and the localized state of the monoatomic vacancy layer in the MTJ system.</description>

      <title>Polyvalent Machine-Learned Potential for Cobalt: from Bulk to Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a quadratic Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (q-SNAP) for ferromagnetic cobalt and its applications to bulk phases, surfaces, and nanoparticles. Trained on Density Functional Theory calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (DFT-PBE) functional, this machine-learned potential enables simulations of large systems over extended time scales across a wide range of temperatures and pressures at near DFT accuracy. It is validated by closely reproducing the phonon dispersions of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, surface energies, and the relative stability of nanoparticles of various shapes. Thermal expansion and the melting point of Co computed with this potential are close to experimental values. Furthermore, this machine-learned potential goes beyond the capabilities of simpler N-body potentials by capturing nuanced properties such as vacancy formation energies on nanoparticle vertices. This accuracy and versatility make the potential suitable for a wide range of applications, including catalysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties, fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits) equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations.
  Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to different kinds of similar tools in the community.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling using Many-Body Perturbation Theory: Implementation in the Questaal Electronic Structure Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to calculate the electron-phonon coupling (e-ph) from first principles is of tremendous interest in materials science, as it provides a non-empirical approach to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena. While this has largely been accomplished in the Kohn-Sham framework of density functional theory (KS-DFT), it is becoming more apparent that standard approximations in KS-DFT can be inaccurate. These discrepancies are often attributed to a non-local potential where more advanced approaches to DFT or many-body perturbation theory have been used. However, a highly reliable and efficient first-principles approach to compute these quantities is still missing. With the goal of realizing a high-fidelity description of e-ph, we present a new field-theoretical methodology, incorporating the seminal work of Baym and Hedin within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, and the Questaal electronic structure package. We show within the response function framework employed here, that no Pulay corrections are needed to account for a change in the basis functions.</description>

      <title>Tunability of charge density wave in a magnetic kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the charge density wave order (CDW) within a magnetically ordered phase in the kagome lattice FeGe has provided a promising platform to investigate intertwined degrees of freedom in kagome lattices. Recently, a method based on post-annealing has been suggested to manipulate the CDW order in kagome FeGe towards either long-range or suppressed orders. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the experimentally measured electronic structures of FeGe crystals that have undergone different post-annealing procedures and demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness on tuning the CDW gap without strong perturbation on the underlying electronic structure. Moreover, we observe an additional low temperature transition that only appears in crystals with a long-range CDW order, which we associate with a lattice-spin coupled order. Our work indicates a likely strong sensitivity of the CDW order to disorder in FeGe, and provides evidence for strong coupling between the electronic, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom in this kagome magnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, whether in bulk form or reduced to just a single layer, have potential applications in spintronics and capacity for advanced quantum phenomena. A prerequisite for harnessing these opportunities lies in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the spin behavior in 2D materials. The low dimensionality motivates an understanding of the spin correlations over a wide length scale, from local to long range order. In this context, we focus on the magnetism in bulk \MPSe ~and \MPS, 2D layered van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductors. These materials have similar honeycomb Mn layers and magnetic ordering temperatures, but distinct spin orientations and exchange interactions. We utilize neutron scattering to gain deeper insights into the local magnetic structures and spin correlations in the paramagnetic and ordered phases by systematically investigating a MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3) series of powder samples using total neutron scattering measurements. By employing magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis, we unraveled the short-range magnetic correlations in these materials and explored how the non-magnetic anion S/Se mixing impacts the magnetic correlations. The results reveal that the magnetism can be gradually tuned through alteration of the non-magnetic S/Se content, which tunes the atomic structure. The change in magnetic structure is also accompanied by a control of the magnetic correlation length within the 2D honeycomb layers. Complimentary inelastic neutron scattering measurements allowed a quantification of the change in the magnetic exchange interactions for the series and further highlighted the gradual evolution of spin interactions in the series MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$.</description>

      <title>Revealing kinetically tuned atomic pathways for interfacial strain relaxation</title>

Abstract: Strain at interfaces may profoundly impact the microstructure and properties of materials; thus, it is a major consideration when designing and engineering materials. Dislocation formation is a commonly known mechanism to release mismatch strain at solid-solid interfaces. However, it is still unclear about how materials accommodate interfacial strain under drastically accelerated structural transformation kinetics, since it is extremely challenging to directly observe the atomic structure evolution of fast-propagating interfaces. Utilizing liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have achieved atomic-scale imaging of hydrogen-induced phase transformations of palladium nanocrystals with different transformation speeds. Our observation reveals that the fast phase transformation occurs with an expanded interface of mixed $\alpha$- and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases, and tilting of (020) planes to accommodate mismatch strain. In contrast, slow phase transformations lead to sharp interfaces with slipping misfit dislocations. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that fast phase transformation pushes the system far-from-equilibrium, generically roughening the interface; however, a smooth boundary minimizes strain near-equilibrium. Unveiling the atomic pathways of transformations from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium, which was previously possible only computationally, this work holds significant implications for engineering microstructure of materials through modulating solid-solid transformations in a wide range of kinetics.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide an ideal platform to explore novel superconducting behavior including Ising superconductivity, topological superconductivity and Majorana bound states in different 2D stoichiometric Ta-, Nb-, and Fe-based crystals. However, tuning the element content in 2D compounds for regulating their superconductivity has not been realized. In this work, we report the synthesis of high quality Fe1+yTe with tunable Fe content by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The quality and composition of Fe1+yTe are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The superconducting behavior of Fe1+yTe crystals with varying Fe contents is observed. The superconducting transition of selected Fe1.13Te sample is sharp ({\Delta}Tc = 1 K), while Fe1.43Te with a high-Fe content shows a relative broad superconducting transition ({\Delta}Tc = 2.6 K) at zero magnetic field. Significantly, the conspicuous vortex flow and a transition from a 3D vortex liquid state to a 2D vortex liquid state is observed in Fe1.43Te sample. Our work highlights the tunability of the superconducting properties of Fe1+yTe and sheds light on the vortex dynamics in Fe-based superconductors, which facilitates us to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Materials with in-plane electrical anisotropy have great potential for designing artificial synaptic devices. However, natural materials with strong intrinsic in-plane electrical anisotropy are rare. We introduce a simple strategy to produce extremely large electrical anisotropy via grating gating of a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of AlGaN/GaN. We show that periodically modulated electric potential in the 2DEG induces in-plane electrical anisotropy, which is significantly enhanced in a magnetic field, leading to an ultra large electrical anisotropy. This is induced by a giant positive magnetoresistance and a giant negative magnetoresistance under two orthogonally oriented in-plane current flows, respectively. This giant electrical anisotropy is in-situ tunable by tailoring both the grating gate voltage and the magnetic field. Our semiconductor device with controllable giant electrical anisotropy will stimulate new device applications, such as multi-terminal memtransistors and bionic synapses.</description>

      <title>Ab initio exploration of short-pitch skyrmion materials: Role of orbital frustration</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the skyrmion lattice phase with a short lattice constant has attracted attention due to its high skyrmion density, making it a promising option for achieving high-density storage memory and for observing novel phenomena like the quantized topological Hall effect. Unlike conventional non-centrosymmetric systems where the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction plays a crucial role, the short pitch skyrmion phase requires a quadratic magnetic interaction $J(q)$ with a peak at finite-$Q$, and weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy is also critical. Thus, conducting first-principles evaluations is essential for understanding the formation mechanism as well as for promoting the discovery of new skyrmion materials. In this {\it Perspective}, we focus on recent developments of the first-principles evaluations of these properties and apply them to the prototype systems Gd$T_2X_2$ and Eu$T_2X_2$, where $T$ denotes a transition metal and $X$ represents Si or Ge. In particular, based on the spin density functional theory with the Hubbard correction combined with the Liechtenstein method in the Wannier tight-binding model formalism, we first show that the Hubbard $U$ and Hund's coupling is essential to stabilize a skyrmion lattice state by enhancing the easy-axis anisotropy. We then discuss mechanisms of finite-$Q$ instability and show that competition among Gd-5$d$ orbitals determines whether ferromagnetism or a finite-$Q$ structure is favored in Gd$T_2$Si$_2$ with $T=$ Fe and Ru. Our systematic calculations reveal that GdRu$_2$$X_2$, GdOs$_2$$X_2$, and GdRe$_2X_2$ are promising, while GdAg$_2X_2$, GdAu$_2X_2$, and EuAg$_2X_2$ are possible candidates as the skyrmion host materials. Analysis based on a spin spiral calculation for the candidate materials is also presented.</description>

      <title>Observation of Kosterlitz-Thouless Metal-to-Insulator Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>

Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. The quantized Hall conductance observed in this sandwich heterostructure originates from the combined contribution of the top and bottom surface states. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle undoped TI layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples and its critical behavior is modulated by the IEC between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), we find that thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance, whereas thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. The IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition in the QAH PPT regime can be understood through a two-channel Chalker-Coddington network model by tuning inter-channel tunneling. The agreement between experiment and theory strongly supports the QAH PPT within the Kosterlitz-Thouless framework, where the critical metal and disordered insulator phases exist in bound and unbound states of vortex-antivortex pairs, respectively.</description>

      <title>A coarse-grained description of anharmonic lattice environments affecting the quantum dynamics of charge carriers</title>

Abstract: Lattice softness has a significant impact on charge carrier dynamics in condensed matter systems, contributing to the emergence of various properties and functions. Examples include the remarkable carrier lifetimes and defect tolerances of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Recent studies suggest the contribution of quartic anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations. The quartic anharmonicity can be discussed with a double-well potential, and the transition between the two minima can be coarse-grained as a two-state jump stochastic process. Such a stochastic approach is typically employed to describe dynamic fluctuations introduced into a system by two-state transitions in the surroundings. To investigate charge transport in materials, however, it is crucial to describe not only the fluctuations but also the dynamic lattice distortion associated with charge transport. Therefore, there is a need for a theory to describe the charge carrier dynamics proceeding alongside the lattice distortion dynamics. In this study, we present a theory that describes quantum dynamics under the influence of an environment with two stable states, termed a bistable environment. The theory describes the effects of fluctuations and dissipation induced from the bistable environment in a reasonable manner, and the effects exhibit a different temperature dependence than the widely employed Gaussian environment. The physical implication of this temperature dependence is provided in terms of the environmental dynamics. The results of this study are expected to provide a step forward in describing charge carrier dynamics in materials with lattice softness and pronounced lattice anharmonicity, e.g., hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Moreover, these findings represent an advancement in our understanding of and capacity to predict and control the physical properties and functions of these materials.</description>

      <title>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</title>

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>

Abstract: Spatial heterogeneity and phase competition are hallmarks of strongly-correlated materials, promising tunable functionality on the nanoscale. Light-induced switching of a correlated insulator to a metallic state is well established. However, optical excitation generally lacks the specificity to select sub-wavelength domains and control final textures. Here, we employ valley-selective photodoping to drive the domain-specific quench of a textured Peierls insulator. Polarized excitation leverages the anisotropy of quasi-one-dimensional states at the correlated gap to initiate an insulator-to-metal transition with minimal electronic heating. We find that averting dissipation facilitates domain-specific carrier confinement, control over nanotextured phases, and a prolonged lifetime of the metastable metallic state. Complementing existing manipulation schemes, valley-selective photoexcitation will enable the activation of electronic phase separation beyond thermodynamic limitations, facilitating optically-controlled hidden states, engineered heterostructures, and polarization-sensitive percolation networks.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</title>

Abstract: Superconducting spintronics focuses on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism and has sparked significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, a direct test for nonunitary superconductors is currently absent, and their identification is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate that spin current driven by the thermal gradient sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. We should note that the spin polarization of the condensate in the momentum space induces the spin-Seebeck effect, and the spin-dependent chirality (spin-chirality) of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect in nonunitary superconductors. Notably, the nonvanishing spin-Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity in materials because it reflects the spin polarization of the Cooper pairs in the momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. Our results position the spin caloritronics phenomena as a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tuning superconductivity in nanosecond laser annealed boron doped $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}$ epilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in ultra-doped $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$ epilayers is demonstrated by nanosecond laser doping, which allows introducing substitutional B concentrations well above the solubility limit and up to $7\,at.\%$. A Ge fraction $x$ ranging from 0 to 0.21 is incorporated in $Si:B$ : 1) through a precursor gas by Gas Immersion Laser Doping; 2) by ion implantation, followed by nanosecond laser annealing; 3) by UHV-CVD growth of a thin Ge layer, followed by nanosecond laser annealing. The 30 nm and 80 nm thick $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$ epilayers display superconducting critical temperatures $T_c$ tuned by B and Ge between 0 and 0.6 K. Within BCS weak-coupling theory, $T_c$ evolves exponentially with both the density of states and the electron-phonon potential. While B doping affects both, through the increase of the carrier density and the tensile strain, Ge incorporation allows addressing independently the lattice deformation influence on superconductivity. To estimate the lattice parameter modulation with B and Ge, Vegard's law is validated for the ternary $SiGeB$ bulk alloy by Density Functional Theory calculations. Its validity is furthermore confirmed experimentally by X-Ray Diffraction. We highlight a global linear dependence of $T_c$ vs. lattice parameter, common for both $Si:B$ and $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$, with $\delta T_c/T_c \sim 50\,\%$ for $\delta a/a \sim 1\,\%$.</description>

Abstract: Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) devices offer improved power efficiency, nonvolatility, and performance compared to static RAM, making them ideal, for instance, for cache memory applications. Efficient magnetization switching, long data retention, and high-density integration in SOT MRAM require ferromagnets (FM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) combined with large torques enhanced by Orbital Hall Effect (OHE). We have engineered PMA [Co/Ni]$_3$ FM on selected OHE layers (Ru, Nb, Cr) and investigated the potential of theoretically predicted larger orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) to quantify the torque and switching current in OHE/[Co/Ni]$_3$ stacks. Our results demonstrate a $\sim$30\% enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency with a positive sign for the Ru OHE layer compared to a pure Pt, accompanied by a $\sim$20\% reduction in switching current for Ru compared to pure Pt across more than 250 devices, leading to more than a 60\% reduction in switching power. These findings validate the application of Ru in devices relevant to industrial contexts, supporting theoretical predictions regarding its superior OHC. This investigation highlights the potential of enhanced orbital torques to improve the performance of orbital-assisted SOT-MRAM, paving the way for next-generation memory technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggest that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductor: SrTiO$_3$, SiO$_2$ (quartz), MgO and Si. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO$_3$ and chiral phonons in SiO$_2$ may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in the trivial insulator MgO and high-purity intrinsic semiconductor Si demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |$\kappa_{xy}$| $\sim$ $\kappa_{xx}^2$. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which must come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>

Abstract: The neutralization probability of low energy Na$^{+}$ ions scattered from In- and As-rich InAs(001) surfaces is measured by time-of-flight spectroscopy. It is found that the neutralization probability for projectiles scattered from As sites is larger than from In sites for both types of surfaces. A modification of the resonant charge transfer model is proposed in which a freezing contour that follows the atomic structure is combined with molecular dynamics and density functional theory. Together, these approaches show that the neutralization of alkali projectiles scattered from a compound solid material is determined by multiple factors, particularly the surface atomic and electronic structures. This model is applicable to any system in which the surface potential is inhomogeneous, such as compound materials and adsorbate-covered surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a tool for discovering and optimizing novel battery materials. However, the adoption of AI in battery cathode representation and discovery is still limited due to the complexity of optimizing multiple performance properties and the scarcity of high-fidelity data. In this study, we present a machine-learning model (DRXNet) for battery informatics and demonstrate the application in the discovery and optimization of disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. We have compiled the electrochemistry data of DRX cathodes over the past five years, resulting in a dataset of more than 19,000 discharge voltage profiles on diverse chemistries spanning 14 different metal species. Learning from this extensive dataset, our DRXNet model can automatically capture critical features in the cycling curves of DRX cathodes under various conditions. Illustratively, the model gives rational predictions of the discharge capacity for diverse compositions in the Li--Mn--O--F chemical space as well as for high-entropy systems. As a universal model trained on diverse chemistries, our approach offers a data-driven solution to facilitate the rapid identification of novel cathode materials, accelerating the development of next-generation batteries for carbon neutralization.</description>

      <title>Chemical Doping-Driven Giant Anomalous Hall and Nernst Conductivity in Magnetic Cubic Heusler Compounds</title>

Abstract: Chemical substitution efficiently optimizes the physical properties of Heusler compounds, especially their anomalous transport properties, including anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study systematically investigates the effect of chemical substitution on AHC and ANC in 1493 magnetic cubic Heusler compounds using high-throughput first-principles calculations. Notable trends emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where chemical substitution effectively enhances the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly, certain chemically substituted candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement in AHCs and ANCs, such as (Co$_{0.8}$Ni$_{0.2}$)$_2$FeSn with considerable AHC and ANC values of $-2567.78$ S cm$^{-1}$ and $8.27$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively, and (Rh$_{0.8}$Ru$_{0.2}$)$_2$MnIn with an AHC of $1950.49$ S cm$^{-1}$. In particular, an extraordinary ANC of $8.57$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ is identified exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_{0.7}$Fe$_{0.3}$In, nearly double the maximum value of $4.36$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ observed in the stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A comprehensive band structure analysis underscores that the notable enhancement in ANC arises from the creation and modification of the energy-dependent nodal lines through chemical substitution. This mechanism generates a robust Berry curvature, resulting in significant ANCs.

      <title>Layer-by-layer phase transformation in Ti$_3$O$_5$ revealed by machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title>

Abstract: Reconstructive phase transitions involving breaking and reconstruction of primary chemical bonds are ubiquitous and important for many technological applications. In contrast to displacive phase transitions, the dynamics of reconstructive phase transitions are usually slow due to the large energy barrier. Nevertheless, the reconstructive phase transformation from $\beta$- to $\lambda$-Ti$_3$O$_5$ exhibits an ultrafast and reversible behavior. Despite extensive studies, the underlying microscopic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we discover a kinetically favorable in-plane nucleated layer-by-layer transformation mechanism through metadynamics and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. This is enabled by developing an efficient machine learning potential with near first-principles accuracy through an on-the-fly active learning method and an advanced sampling technique. Our results reveal that the $\beta$-$\lambda$ phase transformation initiates with the formation of two-dimensional nuclei in the $ab$-plane and then proceeds layer-by-layer through a multistep barrier-lowering kinetic process via intermediate metastable phases. Our work not only provides important insight into the ultrafast and reversible nature of the $\beta$-$\lambda$ transition, but also presents useful strategies and methods for tackling other complex structural phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and extreme micromechanics of additive metal microarchitectures</title>

Abstract: The mechanical performance of metallic metamaterials with 3-dimensional solid frames is typically a combination of the geometrical effect ("architecture") and the characteristic size effects of the base material ("microstructure"). In this study, for the first time, the temperature- and rate-dependent mechanical response of copper microlattices has been investigated. The microlattices were fabricated via a localized electrodeposition in liquid (LEL) process which enables high-precision additive manufacturing of metal at the micro-scale. The metal microlattices possess a unique microstructure with micron sized grains that are rich with randomly oriented growth twins and near-ideal nodal connectivity. Importantly, copper microlattices exhibited unique temperature (-150 and 25 degree C) and strain rate (0.001~100 s-1) dependent deformation behavior during in situ micromechanical testing. Systematic compression tests of fully dense copper micropillars, equivalent in diameter and length to the struts of the microlattice at comparable extreme loading conditions, allow us to investigate the intrinsic deformation mechanism of copper. Combined with the post-mortem microstructural analysis, substantial shifts in deformation mechanisms depending on the temperature and strain rate were revealed. On the one hand, at room temperature (25 degree C), dislocation slip based plastic deformation occurs and leads to a localized deformation of the micropillars. On the other hand, at cryogenic temperature (-150 degree C), mechanical twinning occurs and leads to relatively homogeneous deformation of the micropillars. Based on the intrinsic deformation mechanisms of copper, the temperature and strain rate dependent deformation behavior of microlattices could be explained.</description>

      <title>Gradient elasticity in Swift-Hohenberg and phase-field crystal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Swift-Hohenberg (SH) and Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) models are minimal yet powerful approaches for studying phenomena such as pattern formation, collective order, and defects via smooth order parameters. They are based on a free-energy functional that inherently includes elasticity effects. This study addresses how gradient elasticity (GE), a theory that accounts for elasticity effects at microscopic scales by introducing additional characteristic lengths, is incorporated into SH and PFC models. After presenting the fundamentals of these theories and models, we first calculate the characteristic lengths for various lattice symmetries in an approximated setting. We then discuss numerical simulations of stress fields at dislocations and comparisons with analytic solutions within first and second strain-gradient elasticity. Effective GE characteristic lengths for the elastic fields induced by dislocations are found to depend on the free-energy parameters in the same manner as the phase correlation length, thus unveiling how they change with the quenching depth. The findings presented in this study enable a thorough discussion and analysis of small-scale elasticity effects in pattern formation and crystalline systems using SH and PFC models and, importantly, complete the elasticity analysis therein. Additionally, we provide a microscopic foundation for GE in the context of order-disorder phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Janus MoSSe surface polarization property in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) have attracted much attention because of their outstanding electronic and optical properties. The additional out-of-plane dipole in JTMDs can form n- and p-like Ohmic contacts, and this may be used in device applications such as pin diodes and photovoltaic cells. In this study, we exploit this property to design n- and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). First, we use density-functional theory calculations to study the inherent dipole field strength in the trilayer JTMD MoSSe. The intrinsic dipole of MoSSe causes band bending at both the metal/MoSSe and MoSSe/metal interfaces, resulting in electron and hole accumulation to form n- and p-type Ohmic contact regions. We incorporate this property into a 2D finite-element-based Poisson-drift-diffusion solver to perform simulations, on the basis of which we design complementary MOSFETs. Our results demonstrate that JTMDs can be used to make n- and p-MOSFETs in the same layer without the need for any extra doping.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in altermagnetic $Z^3$ nodal net metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three dimensions, quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport has traditionally been associated with systems featuring a Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many three-dimensional (3D) altermagnetic (AM) metals with a topological nodal net in momentum space but lacking Q1D chain structure in real space, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O, Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. These materials exhibit an AM ground state and feature an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the entire Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates transport in the down-spin channel. This suggests a distinctive Q1D transport signature in each spin channel, with orthogonal principal moving directions for the two spin channels, resulting in Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon cannot be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials. In particular, it gradually disappears as the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net, further confirming its topological origin. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in altermagnets but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Dirac Dispersions and Fermi Surface Nesting in LaCuSb$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LaCuSb$_{2}$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of about $T_\text{c} = 0.9$K and is a potential platform where Dirac fermions can be experimentally observed. In this paper, we report systematic high-resolution studies of its electronic structure using the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) technique supported by the DFT calculation. The Fermi surface consists of four branches, of which the two inner ones are more 3-dimensional and the theoretical calculations reproduce well the experiment. We observe several linear dispersions forming Dirac-like structures. The nodal lines are present in the system along ${\text{M}}$-${\text{A}}$ and ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ and Dirac crossings along ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ are observed by ARPES. Finally, the nesting between external Fermi surface pockets, which corresponds to charge density wave (CDW) modulation vector is enhanced in LaCuSb$_{2}$ as compared to LaAgSb$_{2}$, while CDW appears in the latter system.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of the impurity effect in the kagome superconductor La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the effect of magnetic impurities on the microscopic superconducting (SC) properties of the kagome-lattice superconductor La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ using muon spin relaxation/rotation. A strong suppression of the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, the SC volume fraction, and the superfluid density was observed. We further find a correlation between the superfluid density and $T_{\rm c}$ which is considered a hallmark feature of unconventional superconductivity. Most remarkably, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ${\lambda}$ reveal a change in the low-temperature behavior from exponential saturation to a linear increase, which indicates that Fe doping introduces nodes in the superconducting gap structure at concentrations as low as $x=$~0.015. Our results point to a rare example of unconventional superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice and accessible tunability of the superconducting gap structure, offering new insights into the microscopic mechanisms involved in superconducting order.</description>
