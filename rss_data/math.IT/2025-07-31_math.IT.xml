      <title>Dynamic Exponent Market Maker: Personalized Portfolio Manager and One Pool to Trade Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized exchange platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer operate on several pools where each pool contains two or more cryptocurrencies and constitutes direct trading pairs. The drawbacks here are that liquidity providing requires contribution of tokens in a specific proportion, and trading may require hopping between pools, hence increasing transaction fee and gas fee. We propose an automated market maker (AMM) protocol where liquidity providers can deposit any amount of tokens into the pool. The protocol will preserve the proportion of tokens by total value at the time of deposit and can be seen as a personalized self-balancing portfolio manager. In addition, since the invariant function is dynamic, all exchange pairs are executed from a single composite pool. Nevertheless, the scheme is vulnerable to flash loan attacks and must be used in conjunction with preventive measures.</description>

      <title>Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy, development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM, where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM. Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.</description>

      <title>CLuP practically achieves $\sim 1.77$ positive and $\sim 0.33$ negative Hopfield model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study algorithmic aspects of finding $n$-dimensional \emph{positive} and \emph{negative} Hopfield ($\pm$Hop) model ground state free energies. This corresponds to classical maximization of random positive/negative semi-definite quadratic forms over binary $\left \{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right \}^n$ vectors. The key algorithmic question is whether these problems can be computationally efficiently approximated within a factor $\approx 1$. Following the introduction and success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP-SK) algorithms in finding near ground state energies of closely related Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models [82], we here propose a CLuP$\pm$Hop counterparts for $\pm$Hop models. Fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [78] is utilized to characterize CLuP$\pm$Hop \emph{typical} dynamics. An excellent agreement between practical performance and theoretical predictions is observed. In particular, for $n$ as small as few thousands CLuP$\pm$Hop achieve $\sim 1.77$ and $\sim 0.33$ as the ground state free energies of the positive and negative Hopfield models. At the same time we obtain on the 6th level of lifting (6-spl RDT) corresponding theoretical thermodynamic ($n\rightarrow\infty$) limits $\approx 1.7784$ and $\approx 0.3281$. This positions determining Hopfield models near ground state energies as \emph{typically} easy problems. Moreover, the very same 6th lifting level evaluations allow to uncover a fundamental intrinsic difference between two models: $+$Hop's near optimal configurations are \emph{typically close} to each other whereas the $-$Hop's are \emph{typically far away}.</description>

      <title>Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of zeroes of polynomials on weighted projective spaces over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the maximum number of rational points at which a homogeneous polynomial can vanish on a weighted projective space over a finite field, provided that the first weight is equal to one. This solves a conjecture by Aubry, Castryck, Ghorpade, Lachaud, O'Sullivan and Ram, which stated that a Serre-like bound holds with equality for weighted projective spaces when the first weight is one, and when considering polynomials whose degree is divisible by the least common multiple of the weights. We refine this conjecture by lifting the restriction on the degree and we prove it using footprint techniques, Delorme's reduction and Serre's classical bound.</description>

      <title>CAT and DOG: Improved Codes for Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel constructions of polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM) using outer product partitioning (OPP). We extend the degree table framework from the literature to cyclic-addition degree tables (CATs). By using roots of unity as evaluation points, we enable modulo-addition in the table. Based on CATs, we present an explicit construction, called CATx, that requires fewer workers than existing schemes in the low-privacy regime. Additionally, we present new families of schemes based on conventional degree tables, called GASPrs and DOGrs, that outperform the state-of-the-art for a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Diversity Analysis of ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation offers a promising solution to the problem of severe Doppler effects in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites communications. It has been suggested in the recent literature that ODDM modulation can extract full delay-Doppler (DD) diversity, yet a rigorous analysis has not been presented. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the DD diversity achieved by ODDM modulation along with supporting simulations. Specifically, the analysis and simulations reveal that the asymptotic DD diversity order of ODDM modulation is one, and this order is achieved at lower bit error rate (BER) values for increased frame sizes. We also present low-complexity detector for ODDM modulation based on the Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm, and show that this detector extracts full DD diversity with the reduced complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mimicking the idea of the generalized Hamming weight of linear codes, we introduce a new lattice invariant, the generalized theta series. Applications range from identifying stable lattices to the lattice isomorphism problem. Moreover, we provide counterexamples for the secrecy gain conjecture on isodual lattices, which claims that the ratio of the theta series of an isodual (and more generally, formally unimodular) lattice by the theta series of the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is minimized at a (unique) symmetry point.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Generalization of Deep Reinforcement Learning With Application to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a key machine learning technology driving progress across various scientific and engineering fields, including wireless communication. However, its limited interpretability and generalizability remain major challenges. In supervised learning, generalizability is commonly evaluated through the generalization error using information-theoretic methods. In DRL, the training data is sequential and not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), rendering traditional information-theoretic methods unsuitable for generalizability analysis. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel analytical method for evaluating the generalizability of DRL. Specifically, we first model the evolution of states and actions in trained DRL algorithms as unknown discrete, stochastic, and nonlinear dynamical functions. Then, we employ a data-driven identification method, the Koopman operator, to approximate these functions, and propose two interpretable representations. Based on these interpretable representations, we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to evaluate the generalizability of DRL algorithms. This approach is formulated using the spectral feature analysis of the Koopman operator, leveraging the H_\infty norm. Finally, we apply this generalization analysis to compare the soft actor-critic method, widely recognized as a robust DRL approach, against the proximal policy optimization algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted mmWave wireless communication scenario.</description>

      <title>Spatial Language Likelihood Grounding Network for Bayesian Fusion of Human-Robot Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</description>
