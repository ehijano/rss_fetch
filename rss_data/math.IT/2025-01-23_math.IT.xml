      <title>Improved Coded Caching Scheme for Multi-User Information Retrieval System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the coded caching scheme for the $(L, K, M, N)$ multi-user information retrieval (MIR) system, which consists of a content library containing $N$ files, a base station (BS) with $L$ antennas that cannot access the library, and $K$ single-antenna users, each of which can cache at most $M$ files from the library. The users communicate with the others assisted by the BS to decode their required files. In this paper, we focus on designing a coded caching scheme with low communication latency measured by normalized delivery time (NDT), computational complexity, and subpacketizations. When $\frac{KM}{N}\geq L$ we first simply the precoding matrix in the downlink step to an identity matrix and use the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output networks, to generate several new schemes for MIR system. Compared to the existing schemes, both the theoretical and numerical analyses show that our new schemes achieve much lower computational complexity and smaller subpacketizations with the same NDT.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Codes: Advancing Achievability for Deterministic Identification via Gaussian Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic identification offers an efficient solution for scenarios where decoding entire messages is unnecessary. It is commonly used in alarm systems and control systems. A key advantage of this approach is that the capacity for deterministic identification in Gaussian channels with power constraints grows superexponentially, unlike Shannon's transmission capacity. This allows for a significantly higher number of messages to be transmitted using this event-driven method. So far, only upper and lower bounds for deterministic identification capacity have been established. Our work introduces a novel construction: galaxy codes for deterministic identification. Using these codes, we demonstrate an improvement in the achievability bound of 1/4 to 3/8, representing a previously unknown advance that opens new possibilities for efficient communication.</description>

      <title>Entropy Polarization-Based Data Compression Without Frozen Set Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical source polar codes require the construction of frozen sets for given sources. While this scheme offers excellent theoretical performance, it faces challenges in practical data compression systems, including sensitivity to the accuracy and computational complexity of the construction algorithm. In this letter, we explore the feasibility of construction-free polar compression schemes. By optimally selecting output symbols based on the decoder's behavior, the proposed scheme not only enhances flexibility but also achieves significant improvements in compression rates. Several enhancements are introduced to facilitate the practical implementation of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance compared to existing polar compression approaches.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Non-Adaptive Group Testing with Markovian Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12588v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a correlated group testing model where items are infected according to a Markov chain, which creates bursty binfection patterns. Focusing on a very sparse infections regime, we propose a non adaptive testing strategy with an efficient decoding scheme that is nearly optimal. Specifically, it achieves asymptotically vanishing error with a number of tests that is within a $1/\ln(2) \approx 1.44$ multiplicative factor of the fundamental entropy bound a result that parallels the independent group testing setting. We show that the number of tests reduces with an increase in the expected burst length of infected items, quantifying the advantage of exploiting correlation in test design.</description>

      <title>Indoor Channel Characterization with Extremely Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces at $300$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is lately being considered as a boosting component for various indoor wireless applications, enabling wave propagation control and coverage extension. However, the incorporation of extremely large RISs, as recently being considered for ultra-high capacity industrial environments at subTHz frequencies, imposes certain challenges for indoor channel characterization. In particular, such RISs contribute additional multipath components and their large sizes with respect to the signal wavelength lead to near-field propagation. To this end, ray tracing approaches become quite cumbersome and need to be rerun for different RIS unit cell designs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the incorporation of RISs in indoor multipath environments towards their efficient channel characterization. An $100\times100$ RIS design with $2$-bit resolution unit cells realizing a fixed anomalous reflection at 300 GHz is presented, whose radar cross section patterns are obtained via full-wave simulations. It is showcased that the RIS behavior can be conveniently approximated by a three-ray model, which can be efficiently incorporated within available ray tracing tools, and that the far-field approximation is valid for even very small distances from the RIS.</description>

      <title>Non-adaptive Learning of Random Hypergraphs with Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a hidden hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ by making a single batch of queries (non-adaptively). We consider the hyperedge detection model, in which every query must be of the form:
  ``Does this set $S\subseteq V$ contain at least one full hyperedge?''
  In this model, it is known that there is no algorithm that allows to non-adaptively learn arbitrary hypergraphs by making fewer than $\Omega(\min\{m^2\log n, n^2\})$ even when the hypergraph is constrained to be $2$-uniform (i.e. the hypergraph is simply a graph). Recently, Li et al. overcame this lower bound in the setting in which $G$ is a graph by assuming that the graph learned is sampled from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We generalize the result of Li et al. to the setting of random $k$-uniform hypergraphs. To achieve this result, we leverage a novel equivalence between the problem of learning a single hyperedge and the standard group testing problem. This latter result may also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted Multi-User Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are eminently suitable for improving the reliability of wireless communications by jointly designing the active beamforming at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS. Therefore, the accuracy of channel estimation is crucial for RIS-aided systems. The challenge is that only the cascaded two-hop channel spanning from the user equipments (UEs) to the RIS and spanning from the RIS to the BS can be estimated, due to the lack of active radio frequency (RF) chains at RIS elements, which leads to high pilot overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-overhead linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation method by exploiting the spatial correlation of channel links, which strikes a trade-off between the pilot overhead and the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we calculate the theoretical normalized mean square error (MSE) for our channel estimation method. Finally, we verify numerically that the proposed LMMSE estimator has lower MSE than the state-of-the-art (SoA) grouping based estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an achievability bound on the frame error rate of random tree code ensembles under a sequential decoding algorithm with a hard computational limit and consider the optimization of the random tree code ensembles over their branching structures/profiles and the decoding measure. Through numerical examples, we show that the achievability bound for the optimizated random tree codes can approach the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding performance of pure random codes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal de Bruijn Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A de Bruijn sequence of order $k$ over a finite alphabet is a cyclic sequence with the property that it contains every possible $k$-sequence as a substring exactly once. Orthogonal de Bruijn sequences are collections of de Bruijn sequences of the same order, $k$, satisfying the joint constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears as a substring in at most one of the sequences in the collection. Both de Bruijn and orthogonal de Bruijn sequences have found numerous applications in synthetic biology, although the latter topic remains largely unexplored in the coding theory literature. Here we study three relevant practical generalizations of orthogonal de Bruijn sequences where we relax either the constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears exactly once, or that the sequences themselves are de Bruijn rather than balanced de Bruijn sequences. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the number of fixed-weight orthogonal de Bruijn sequences.</description>

      <title>Robust Hypothesis Testing with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12938v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the binary hypothesis testing problem where an adversary may potentially corrupt a fraction of the samples. The detector is, however, permitted to abstain from making a decision if (and only if) the adversary is present. We consider a few natural "contamination models" and characterize for them the trade-off between the error exponents of the four types of errors -- errors of deciding in favour of the incorrect hypothesis when the adversary is present and errors of abstaining or deciding in favour of the wrong hypothesis when the adversary is absent, under the two hypotheses.</description>

      <title>On Universal Decoding over Discrete Additive Channels by Noise Guessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal decoding over parametric discrete additive channels. Our decoders are variants of noise guessing decoders that use estimators for the probability of a noise sequence, when the actual channel law is unknown. A deterministic version produces noise sequences in a fixed order, and a randomised one draws them at random; noise sequences are then queried whether they result in a valid codeword when subtracted from the received sequence. In all cases, we give sufficient conditions on the family of parametric channels for the decoding strategies to be random-coding strongly universal, and we derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the complexity of such strategies. We give examples of families in which our results hold, and a numerical example illustrates this performance.</description>

These bounds generalize the tight bounds for single-node failure presented by Balaji et al. (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 68, no. 10, 2022). Moreover, we utilize generating functions to provide a more refined analysis, further strengthening these bounds.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Poltyrev Bound to Binary Memoryless Symmetric Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poltyrev bound provides a very tight upper bound on the decoding error probability when using binary linear codes for transmission over the binary symmetric channel and the additive white Gaussian noise channel, making use of the code's weight spectrum. In the present work, the bound is extended to memoryless symmetric channels with a discrete output alphabet. The derived bound is demonstrated on a hybrid BSC-BEC channel. Additionally, a reduced-complexity bound is introduced at the cost of some loss in tightness.</description>

      <title>A MIMO ISAC System for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system to detect the arrival of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a dual-function base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing based ISAC and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.</description>

      <title>Information Degradation and Misinformation in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study networks of gossiping users where a source observing a process sends updates to an underlying graph. Nodes in the graph update their neighbors randomly and nodes always accept packets that have newer information, thus attempting to minimize their age of information (AoI). We show that while gossiping reduces AoI, information can rapidly degrade in such a network. We model degradation by arbitrary discrete-time Markov chains on k states. As a packet is transmitted through the network it modifies its state according to the Markov chain. In the last section, we specialize the Markov chain to represent misinformation spread, and show that the rate of misinformation spread is proportional to the age of information in both the fully-connected graph and ring graph.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Study of the Min-Sum Approximation for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes. Although it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in practice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common case of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using successive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions, we show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly calculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time $O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code construction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we develop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\mathrm{L}} = R_{\mathrm{L}}(\lambda)$ and $R_{\mathrm{U}} =R_{\mathrm{U}}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the labeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R &lt; R_{\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of polar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and their error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\beta}$. That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that $0 &lt; R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13093v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</description>

      <title>Which Sensor to Observe? Timely Tracking of a Joint Markov Source with Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of remote estimation of a discrete-time joint Markov process using multiple sensors. Each sensor observes a different component of the joint Markov process, and in each time slot, the monitor obtains a partial state value by sending a pull request to one of the sensors. The monitor chooses the sequence of sensors to observe with the goal of minimizing the mean of age of incorrect information (MAoII) by using the partial state observations obtained, which have different freshness levels. For instance, a monitor may be interested in tracking the location of an object by obtaining observations from two sensors, which observe the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the object separately, in different time slots. The monitor, then, needs to decide which coordinate to observe in the next time slot given the history. In addition to this partial observability of the state of Markov process, there is an erasure channel with a fixed one-slot delay between each sensor and the monitor. First, we obtain a sufficient statistic, namely the \emph{belief}, representing the joint distribution of the age of incorrect information (AoII) and the current state of the observed process by using the history of all pull requests and observations. Then, we formulate the problem with a continuous state-space Markov decision problem (MDP), namely belief MDP. To solve the problem, we propose two model predictive control (MPC) methods, namely MPC without terminal costs (MPC-WTC) and reinforcement learning MPC (RL-MPC), that have different advantages in implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for text summarization. We define the summarizer rate-distortion function and show that it provides a fundamental lower bound on summarizer performance. We describe an iterative procedure, similar to Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, for computing this function. To handle real-world text datasets, we also propose a practical method that can calculate the summarizer rate-distortion function with limited data. Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.</description>

      <title>On the Service Rate Region of Reed-Muller Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13105v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Service Rate Region (SRR) of Reed-Muller (RM) codes in the context of distributed storage systems. The SRR is a convex polytope comprising all achievable data access request rates under a given coding scheme. It represents a critical metric for evaluating system efficiency and scalability. Using the geometric properties of RM codes, we characterize recovery sets for data objects, including their existence, uniqueness, and enumeration. This analysis reveals a connection between recovery sets and minimum-weight codewords in the dual RM code, providing a framework for identifying small recovery sets. Using these results, we derive explicit and tight bounds for the maximal achievable demand for individual data objects, which define the maximal simplex within the service rate region.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo based non-line-of-sight underwater wireless optical communication channel modeling and system performance analysis under turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with line-of-sight (LOS) communication, nonline-of-sight (NLOS) underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems have garnered extensive attention because of their heightened suitability for the intricate and dynamic underwater environment. In the NLOS channel, photons can reach the receiver by sea surface reflection or particle scattering. However, research lacks comprehensive channel models that incorporate sea surface reflection and particle scattering. Moreover, the presence of ocean turbulence introduces random fluctuations in the received optical signal based on the average light intensity. Consequently, this paper adopts the Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) to solve the fading-free impulse response of the joint reflection-scattering channel. Furthermore, a weighted double gamma function (WDGF) is proposed to characterize the channel impulse response (CIR). Based on the closed CIR model, the average bit error rate and the performance of the interruption probability of the UWOC system under turbulence are analyzed. The conclusions obtained are intended to assist in the design and performance evaluation of NLOS UWOC systems.</description>

      <title>Hardware Distortion Modeling for Panel Selection in Large Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware distortion in large intelligent surfaces (LISs) may limit their performance when scaling up such systems. It is of great importance to model the non-ideal effects in their transceivers to study the hardware distortions that can affect their performance. Therefore, we have focused on modeling and studying the effects of nonlinear RX-chains in LISs. We first derive expressions for SNDR of a LIS with a memory-less polynomial-based model at its RX-chains. Then we propose a simplified double-parameter exponential model for the distortion power and show that compared to the polynomial based model, the exponential model can improve the analytical tractability for SNDR optimization problems. In particular, we consider a panel selection optimization problems in a panel-based LIS scenario and show that the proposed model enables us to derive two closed-form sub-optimal solutions for panel selection, and can be a favorable alternative to high-order polynomial models in terms of computation complexity, especially for theoretical works on hardware distortion in MIMO and LIS systems. Numerical results show that the sub-optimal closed-form solutions have a near-optimal performance in terms of SNDR compared to the global optimum found by high-complexity heuristic search methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Selection via Hypothesis Testing on Reliability Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sensitive application domains, multi-objective hyperparameter selection can ensure the reliability of AI models prior to deployment, while optimizing auxiliary performance metrics. The state-of-the-art Pareto Testing (PT) method guarantees statistical reliability constraints by adopting a multiple hypothesis testing framework. In PT, hyperparameters are validated one at a time, following a data-driven order determined by expected reliability levels. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-objective hyperparameter selection that captures the interdependencies among the reliability levels of different hyperparameter configurations using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is termed the reliability graph (RG). The RG is constructed based on prior information and data by using the Bradley-Terry model. The proposed approach, RG-based PT (RG-PT), leverages the RG to enable the efficient, parallel testing of multiple hyperparameters at the same reliability level. By integrating False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, RG-PT ensures robust statistical reliability guarantees and is shown via experiments across diverse domains to consistently yield superior solutions for multi-objective calibration problems.</description>

Abstract: CSS-T codes are a class of stabilizer codes introduced by Rengaswamy \emph{et al} with desired properties for quantum fault-tolerance. In this work, we comprehensively study non-degenerate CSS-T codes built from Reed-Muller codes. These classical codes allow for constructing CSS-T code families with nonvanishing asymptotic rates up to $\frac{1}2$ and possibly diverging minimum distance when non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Coded Caching for Multi-Access Networks with Cyclic Wrap-Around</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r &lt; K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study in group testing aims to develop strategies to identify a small set of defective items among a large population using a few pooled tests. The established techniques have been highly beneficial in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from channel communication to identifying COVID-19-infected individuals efficiently. Despite significant research on group testing and its variants since the 1940s, testing strategies robust to deletion noise have yet to be studied. Many practical systems exhibit deletion errors, for instance, in wireless communication and data storage systems. Such deletions of test outcomes lead to asynchrony between the tests, which the current group testing strategies cannot handle. In this work, we initiate the study of non-adaptive group testing strategies resilient to deletion noise. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions to successfully identify the defective items even after the adversarial deletion of certain test outputs. We also provide constructions of testing matrices along with an efficient recovery algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Codes with locality, also known as locally recoverable codes, allow for recovery of erasures using proper subsets of other coordinates. These subsets are typically of small cardinality to promote recovery using limited network traffic and other resources. Hierarchical locally recoverable codes allow for recovery of erasures using sets of other symbols whose sizes increase as needed to allow for recovery of more symbols. In this paper, we describe a hierarchical recovery structure arising from geometry in Reed-Muller codes and codes with availability from fiber products of curves. We demonstrate how the fiber product hierarchical codes can be viewed as punctured subcodes of Reed-Muller codes, uniting the two constructions. This point of view provides natural structures for local recovery with availability at each level in the hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with a novel cost constraint that constrains both the mean and the variance of the cost of the codewords. We show that the maximum (asymptotically) achievable rate under the new cost formulation is equal to the capacity-cost function; in particular, the strong converse holds. We further characterize the optimal second-order coding rate of these cost-constrained codes; in particular, the optimal second-order coding rate is finite. We then show that the second-order coding performance is strictly improved with feedback using a new variation of timid/bold coding, significantly broadening the applicability of timid/bold coding schemes from unconstrained compound-dispersion channels to all cost-constrained channels. Equivalent results on the minimum average probability of error are also given.</description>

      <title>On Optimal MMSE Channel Estimation for One-Bit Quantized MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit quantization at the receiver side. Despite its optimality and significance in estimation theory, the MMSE channel estimator has not been fully investigated in this context due to its general non-linearity and computational complexity. Instead, the typically suboptimal Bussgang linear MMSE (BLMMSE) estimator has been widely adopted. In this work, we develop a new framework to compute the MMSE channel estimator that hinges on computation of the orthant probability of the multivariate normal distribution. Based on this framework, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal and equivalent to the MMSE estimator. Under the assumption of specific channel correlation or pilot symbols, we further utilize the framework to derive analytical expressions for the MMSE channel estimator that are particularly convenient for computation when certain system dimensions become large, thereby enabling a comparison between the BLMMSE and MMSE channel estimators in these cases.</description>

Abstract: This study presents alternating optimization (AO) algorithms for computing $\alpha$-mutual information ($\alpha$-MI) and $\alpha$-capacity based on variational characterizations of $\alpha$-MI using a reverse channel. Specifically, we derive several variational characterizations of Sibson, Arimoto, Augustin--Csisz{\' a}r, and Lapidoth--Pfister MI and introduce novel AO algorithms for computing $\alpha$-MI and $\alpha$-capacity; their performances for computing $\alpha$-capacity are also compared. The comparison results show that the AO algorithm based on the Sibson MI's characterization has the fastest convergence speed.</description>

Abstract: In Group Testing, the objective is to identify $K$ defective items out of $N$, $K\ll N$, by testing pools of items together and using the least amount of tests possible. Recently, a fast decoding method based on binary splitting (Price and Scarlett, 2020) has been proposed that simultaneously achieve optimal number of tests and decoding complexity for Non-Adaptive Probabilistic Group Testing (NAPGT). However, the method works only when the test results are noiseless. In this paper, we further study the binary splitting method and propose (1) A NAPGT scheme that generalizes the original binary splitting method from the noiseless case into tests with $\rho$ proportion of false positives (the $\rho$-False Positive Channel), where $\rho$ is a constant, with asymptotically-optimal number of tests and decoding complexity, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(K\log N)$, and (2) A NAPGT scheme in the presence of both false positives and false negatives in test outcomes, improving and generalizing the work of Price, Scarlett and Tan~\cite{price2023fast} in two ways: First, under $\rho$-proportion of test results flipped ($\rho$-Binary Symmetric Channel) and within the general sublinear regime $K=\Theta(N^\alpha)$ where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, our algorithm has a decoding complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}K^{1+\epsilon})$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a constant parameter. Second, when the false negative flipping probability $\rho'$ satisfies $\rho'=\mathcal{O}(K^{-\epsilon})$ and the false positive flipping probability $\rho$ is a constant, we can simultaneously achieve $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}K\log N)$ for both the number of tests and the decoding complexity. It remains open to achieve these optimals under the general BSC.</description>

      <title>New Channel Coding Lower Bounds for Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06497v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of point-to-point communication networks and biological storage, we investigate new achievability bounds for noisy permutation channels with strictly positive and full-rank square matrices. Our new bounds use $\epsilon$-packing with Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric to bound the distance between distributions and are tighter than existing bounds. Additionally, Gaussian approximations of achievability bounds are derived, and the numerical evaluation shows the precision of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Classification of LCD and self-dual codes over a finite non-unital local ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores LCD and self-dual codes over a noncommutative non-unital ring $ E_p= \langle r,s ~|~ pr =ps=0,~ r^2=r,~ s^2=s,~ rs=r,~ sr=s \rangle$ of order $p^2$ where $p$ is a prime. Initially, we study the monomial equivalence of two free $E_p$-linear codes. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a free $E_p$-linear code to be MDS and almost MDS (AMDS). Then, we use these results to classify MDS and AMDS LCD codes over $E_2$ and $E_3$ under monomial equivalence for lengths up to $6$. Subsequently, we study left self-dual codes over the ring $E_p$ and classify MDS and AMDS left self-dual codes over $E_2$ and $E_3$ for lengths up to $12$. Finally, we study self-dual codes over the ring $E_p$ and classify MDS and AMDS self-dual codes over $E_2$ and $E_3$ for smaller lengths.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e Lower Bound Approach for Performance Trade-offs in MIMO ISAC Systems with Blockage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the performance trade-offs between sensing and communication subsystems is essential for enabling integrated sensing and communication systems. Various metrics exist for each subsystem; however, this study focuses on the ergodic capacity of the communication subsystem. Due to the complexity of deriving the sensing mean square error (MSE) and the inapplicability of the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound to channels with discrete or mixed distributions, this work proposes a Poincar\'e lower bound on the sensing MSE to address these issues. An achievable inner bound for the rate-sensing trade-off in a fading multiple-input multiple-output channel with additive white Gaussian noise and blockage probability is established. In addition, a strategy that is asymptotically optimal for sensing is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a study of the convexity of mutual information regarded as the function of time along the Fokker-Planck equation and generalize conclusions in the cases of heat flow and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow, which were established by A. Wibisono and V. Jog. We firstly prove the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to a class of Fokker-Planck equations and then we obtain the second derivative of mutual information along the Fokker-Planck equation. We prove that if the initial distribution is sufficiently strongly log-concave compared to the steady state, then mutual information always preserves convexity under suitable conditions. In particular, if there exists some time point at which the distribution at this time is sufficiently strongly log-concave compared to the steady state, then mutual information preserves convexity after this time under suitable conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the rate-distortion theory from the perspective of optimal weak transport, as recently introduced by Gozlan et al. While the conditions for optimality and the existence of solutions are well-understood in the case of discrete alphabets, the extension to abstract alphabets requires more intricate analysis. Within the framework of weak transport problems, we derive a parametric representation of the rate-distortion function, thereby connecting the rate-distortion function with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, and establish necessary conditions for its optimality. As a byproduct of our analysis, we reproduce K. Rose's conclusions regarding the achievability of Shannon lower bound concisely, without reliance on variational calculus.</description>

      <title>Optimal Functional $2^{s-1}$-Batch Codes: Exploring New Sufficient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A functional $k$-batch code of dimension $s$ consists of $n$ servers storing linear combinations of $s$ linearly independent information bits. These codes are designed to recover any multiset of $k$ requests, each being a linear combination of the information bits, by $k$ disjoint subsets of servers. A recent conjecture suggests that for any set of $k = 2^{s-1}$ requests, the optimal solution requires $2^s-1$ servers. This paper shows that the problem of functional $k$-batch codes is equivalent to several other problems. Using these equivalences, we derive sufficient conditions that improve understanding of the problem and enhance the ability to find the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Clustered Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to identify the true hypothesis using as few as possible observations while maintaining accuracy. The DM collects observations according to its determined actions and knows the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination strategy where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards hypotheses in light of its obtained observations. The DM selects actions based on maximal separation expressed by the distance between the parameter vectors of each distribution under each hypothesis. Close distributions can be clustered, simplifying the search and significantly reducing the number of required observations.
  Our algorithms achieve vanishing Average Bayes Risk (ABR) as the error probability approaches zero, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, we show that the ABR is bounded when the number of hypotheses grows. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the algorithm's performance compared to another multi-stage hypothesis-elimination algorithm, where an improvement of several orders of magnitude in the mean number of observations required is observed.</description>

      <title>Strong Data Processing Properties of R\'enyi-divergences via Pinsker-type Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strong data processing inequalities (SDPIs) of the R\'enyi-divergence between two discrete distributions when both distributions are passed through a fixed channel. We provide a condition on the channel for which the DPI holds with equality given two arbitrary distributions in the probability simplex. Motivated by this, we examine the contraction behavior for restricted sets of prior distributions via $f$-divergence inequalities: We provide an alternative proof of the optimal reverse Pinsker's inequality for R\'enyi-divergences first shown by Binette. We further present an improved Pinsker's inequality for R\'enyi-divergence based on the joint range technique by Harremo\"es and Vajda. The presented bound is tight whenever the value of the total variation distance is larger than $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. By framing these inequalities in a cross-channel setting, we arrive at SDPIs that can be adapted to use-case specific restrictions of input distribution and channel. We apply these results to the R\'enyi local differential privacy amplification through post-processing by channels that satisfy no local differential privacy guarantee.</description>

      <title>Detecting Convolutional Codes: A Markovian Approach with LRT and DNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the unknown convolutional code corresponding to the given intercepted data is an important problem in military surveillance and in wireless communication. While a variety of code identification algorithms are available in the literature, the key contribution of our work lies in the novel solution and the corresponding analysis. In this paper, we focus on the situation when the given data corresponds to either of the two potential convolutional codes and the goal is to detect the correct code. We first provide a new interpretation of the convolutional code as a Markov chain, which is more suitable for analyzing the code detection problem. Our problem then gets reduced to identifying between the two Markov chains. We provide the closed-form expressions for the corresponding state transition matrices and estimate the error exponent for the underlying likelihood ratio test (LRT). We also provide a computationally efficient BCJR-based method for computing the likelihoods required for the LRT. We observe that BCJR-based likelihoods suffer from numerical issues for a longer data sequence, and hence, in this case, we design neural networks that have been found to achieve the optimal performance of the LRT.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning for Cellular VR: Online Learning and Dynamic Caching</title>

Abstract: Delivering an immersive experience to virtual reality (VR) users through wireless connectivity offers the freedom to engage from anywhere at any time. Nevertheless, it is challenging to ensure seamless wireless connectivity that delivers real-time and high-quality videos to the VR users. This paper proposes a field of view (FoV) aware caching for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network. In particular, the FoV of each VR user is cached/prefetched at the base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. Specifically, decentralized and personalized federated learning (DP-FL) based caching strategies with guarantees are presented. Considering VR systems composed of multiple VR devices and BSs, a DP-FL caching algorithm is implemented at each BS to personalize content delivery for VR users. The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost of communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient descent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Additionally, to better account for the wireless channel dynamics, the FoVs are grouped into multicast or unicast groups based on the number of requesting VR users. The performance of the proposed DP-FL algorithm is validated through realistic VR head-tracking dataset, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have better performance in terms of average delay and cache hit as compared to baseline algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach that harnesses the standard interference function, specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of non-convex optimization in wireless networks. We begin by establishing theoretical guarantees for our method under the assumption that the interference function exhibits log-concavity. Building on this foundation, we develop a Primal-Dual Algorithm (PDA) to approximate the solution to the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. To further enhance computational efficiency, we leverage the deep unfolding technique, significantly reducing the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art fractional programming benchmark, commonly referred to as FPLinQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes under information divergences such as $f$-divergences and R\'enyi divergences. We classify most common divergences into four types, namely $L^2$-type, $\mathrm{TV}$-type, separation-type and $\mathrm{KL}$ divergence, in which we prove that the cutoff phenomenon are equivalent and relate the cutoff time and window among members within each type. To justify that this classification is natural, we provide examples in which the family of Markov processes exhibit cutoff in one type but not in another. We also establish new product conditions in these settings for the processes to exhibit cutoff, along with new results in non-reversible or non-normal situations. The proofs rely on a functional analytic approach towards cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have drastically changed the prospects of AI by introducing technologies for more complex natural language processing. However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT and GPT-2 standards as both a stand-alone tokenizer and an add-on to existing tokenizers while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the capacity of wireless communication links by passively beamforming the impinging signals in desired directions. This feature has been demonstrated both analytically and experimentally for conventional RISs, consisting of independently reflecting elements. To further enhance reconfigurability, a new architecture called beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed. It allows for controllable signal flows between RIS elements, resulting in a non-diagonal reflection matrix, unlike the conventional RIS architecture. Previous studies on BD-RIS-assisted communications have predominantly considered single-antenna transmitters/receivers. One recent work provides an iterative capacity-improving algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups but without providing geometrical insights.
  In this paper, we derive the first closed-form capacity-maximizing BD-RIS reflection matrix for a MIMO channel. We describe how this solution pairs together propagation paths, how it behaves when the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and what capacity is achievable with ideal semi-unitary channel matrices. The analytical results are corroborated numerically.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>

Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length. In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$. Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results. By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help combat misinformation.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with fewer than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we establish bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These constraints yield new bounds on the distances of classical Hermitian self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, notably proving the nonexistence of such codes with parameters $[12m, 6m, 4m+2]_{GF(4)}$.</description>
