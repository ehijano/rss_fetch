      <title>On Geometric Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known fact that although the poset of open sets of a topological space is a Heyting algebra, its Heyting implication is not necessarily stable under the inverse image of continuous functions and hence is not a geometric concept. This leaves us wondering if there is any stable family of implications that can be safely called geometric. In this paper, we will first recall the abstract notion of implication as a binary modality introduced in [1]. Then, we will use a weaker version of categorical fibrations to define the geometricity of a category of pairs of spaces and implications over a given category of spaces. We will identify the greatest geometric category over the subcategories of open-irreducible (closed-irreducible) maps as a generalization of the usual injective open (closed) maps. Using this identification, we will then characterize all geometric categories over a given category S, provided that S has some basic closure properties. Specially, we will show that there is no non-trivial geometric category over the full category of spaces. Finally, as the implications we identified are also interesting in their own right, we will spend some time to investigate their algebraic properties. We will first use a Yoneda-type argument to provide a representation theorem, making the implications a part of an adjunction-style pair. Then, we will use this result to provide a Kripke-style representation for any arbitrary implication.</description>

      <title>Kripke-like models of Set Theory in Modal Residuated Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Fitting's work on Intuitionistic Kripke models of Set Theory using Ono and Komori's Residuated Kripke models. Based on these models, we provide a generalization of the von Neumann hierarchy in the context of Modal Residuated Logic and prove a translation of formulas between it and a suited Heyting valued model. We also propose a notion of universe of constructible sets in Modal Residuated Logic and discuss some aspects of it.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of approximate exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and axiomatize approximate exclusion atoms in the team semantic setting. A team is a set of assignments, which can be seen as a mathematical model of a uni-relational database, and we say that an approximate exclusion atom is satisfied in a team if the corresponding usual exclusion atom is satisfied in a large enough subteam. We consider the implication problem for approximate exclusion atoms and show that it is axiomatizable for consequences with a degree of approximation that is not too large. We prove the completeness theorem for usual exclusion atoms, which is currently missing from the literature, and generalize it to approximate exclusion atoms. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm for the implication problems. The results also apply to exclusion dependencies in database theory.</description>

      <title>On $\operatorname{Alt}(n)$-modules with an additive dimension when $n\le6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in the general context of "modules with an additive dimension," we complete the determination of the minimal dimension of a faithful Alt(n)-module and classify those modules in three of the exceptional cases: 2-dimensional Alt(5)-modules in characteristic 2, 3-dimensional Alt(5)-modules in characteristic 5, and 3-dimensional Alt(6)-modules in characteristic 3. We also highlight the remaining work needed to complete the classification of the faithful Alt(n)-modules of minimal dimension for all n; these open problems seem well suited as projects for advanced undergraduate or master's students.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic logic over semi-primal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics I: Presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of modal logic has witnessed tremendous development following the introduction of Kripke semantics. However, recent developments in programming languages and type theory have led to a second way of studying modalities, namely through their categorical semantics. We show how the two correspond.</description>
