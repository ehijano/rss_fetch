      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>

      <title>Separation axiom $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semispaces of a convexity space $(X,C)$ are maximal convex sets missing a point. The separation axiom $S_3$ asserts that any point $x_0\in X$ and any convex set $A$ not containing $x_0$ can be separated by complementary halfspaces (convex sets with convex complements) or, equivalently, that all semispaces are halfspaces. In this paper, we study $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs and the structure of semispaces in $S_3$-graphs. We characterize $S_3$-graphs and their semispaces in terms of separation by halfspaces of vertices $x_0$ and special sets, called maximal $x_0$-proximal sets and in terms of convexity of their mutual shadows $x_0/K$ and $K/x_0$. In $S_3$-graphs $G$ satisfying the triangle condition (TC), maximal proximal sets are the pre-maximal cliques of $G$ (i.e., cliques $K$ such that $K\cup\{ x_0\}$ are maximal cliques). This allows to characterize the $S_3$-graphs satisfying (TC) in a structural way and to enumerate their semispaces efficiently. In case of meshed graphs (an important subclass of graphs satisfying (TC)), the $S_3$-graphs have been characterized by excluding five forbidden subgraphs. On the way of proving this result, we also establish some properties of meshed graphs, which maybe of independent interest. In particular, we show that any connected, locally-convex set of a meshed graph is convex. We also provide several examples of $S_3$-graphs, including the basis graphs of matroids. Finally, we consider the (NP-complete) halfspace separation problem, describe two methods of its solution, and apply them to particular classes of graphs and graph-convexities.</description>

      <title>New Solutions to Delsarte's Dual Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance is a major question in computer science and discrete mathematics. The most fruitful approach for finding asymptotic bounds on such codes is by using Delsarte's theory of association schemes. With this approach, Delsarte constructs a linear program such that its maximum value is an upper bound on the maximum size of a code with a given minimum distance. Bounding this value can be done by finding solutions to the corresponding dual linear program. Delsarte's theory is very general and goes way beyond binary codes.
  In this work, we provide universal bounds in the framework of association schemes that generalize the Hamming bound and the Elias-Bassalygo bound, which can be applied to any association scheme constructed from a distance function. These bounds are obtained by constructing new solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program. We instantiate these results and we recover known bounds for $q$-ary codes and for constant-weight binary codes but which didn't come from the linear program method. Our other contribution is to recover, for essentially any $Q$-polynomial scheme, MRRW-type solutions to Delsarte's dual linear program which are inspired by the Laplacian approach of Friedman and Tillich instead of using the Christoffel-Darboux formulas. We show in particular how the second linear programming bound can be interpreted in this framework.</description>

      <title>An almost complete $t$-intersection theorem for permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n&gt;(1+\epsilon)t$, $n&gt;n_0(\epsilon)$ we determine the size of the largest $t$-intersecting family of permutations, as well as give a sharp stability result. This resolves a conjecture of Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel (2011) and shows the validity of conjectures of Frankl and Deza (1977) and Cameron (1988) for $n&gt;(1+\epsilon )t$. We note that, for this range of parameters, the extremal examples are not necessarily trivial, and that our statement is analogous to the celebrated Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem. The proof is based on the refinement of the method of spread approximations, recently introduced by Kupavskii and Zakharov (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $C$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an identifying code if it is dominating and any two vertices of $V$ are dominated by distinct sets of codewords. This paper presents a survey of Iiro Honkala's contributions to the study of identifying codes with respect to several aspects: complexity of computing an identifying code, combinatorics in binary Hamming spaces, infinite grids, relationships between identifying codes and usual parameters in graphs, structural properties of graphs admitting identifying codes, and number of optimal identifying codes.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07199v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $d \geq 2$, a distance-$d$ independent set (D$d$IS) of a graph is a vertex subset whose distance between any two members is at least $d$. Imagine that there is a token placed on each member of a D$d$IS. Two D$d$ISs are adjacent under Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$) if one can be obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its unoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$), the target vertex needs not to be adjacent to the original one. The Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration (D$d$ISR) problem under $\mathsf{TS}/\mathsf{TJ}$ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent D$d$ISs that transforms one given D$d$IS into another. The problem for $d = 2$, also known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem, has been well-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several graph classes has been known. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of D$d$ISR on different graphs under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ for any fixed $d \geq 3$. On chordal graphs, we show that D$d$ISR under $\mathsf{TJ}$ is in $\mathtt{P}$ when $d$ is even and $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete when $d$ is odd. On split graphs, there is an interesting complexity dichotomy: D$d$ISR is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 2$ but in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d=3$ under $\mathsf{TS}$, while under $\mathsf{TJ}$ it is in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d = 2$ but $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 3$. Additionally, certain well-known hardness results for $d = 2$ on perfect graphs and planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth can be extended for $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Cliques, Chromatic Number, and Independent Sets in the Semi-random Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. In this paper, we investigate the following three properties: containing a complete graph of order $k$, having the chromatic number at least $k$, and not having an independent set of size at least $k$.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Patrolling Grids with a Bit of Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of patrolling regular grid graphs of any dimension using a single mobile agent with minimal memory and limited sensing range. We show that it is impossible to patrol some grid graphs with $0$ bits of memory, regardless of sensing range, and give an exact characterization of those grid graphs that can be patrolled with $0$ bits of memory and sensing range $V$. On the other hand, we show that an algorithm exists using $1$ bit of memory and $V=1$ that patrols any $d$-dimensional grid graph. This result is surprising given that the agent must be able to move in $2d$ distinct directions to patrol, while $1$ bit of memory allows specifying only two directions per sensory input. Our $1$-bit patrolling algorithm handles this by carefully exploiting a small state-space to access all the needed directions while avoiding getting stuck. Overall, our results give concrete evidence that extremely little memory is needed for patrolling highly regular environments like grid graphs compared to arbitrary graphs. The techniques we use, such as partitioning the environment into sensing regions and exploiting distinct coordinates resulting from higher-dimensionality, may be applicable to analyzing the space complexity of patrolling in other types of regular environments as well.</description>

      <title>A Constant Factor Approximation for Directed Feedback Vertex Set in Graphs of Bounded Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum directed feedback vertex set problem consists in finding the minimum set of vertices that should be removed in order to make a directed graph acyclic. This is a well-known NP-hard optimization problem with applications in various fields, such as VLSI chip design, bioinformatics and transaction processing deadlock prevention and node-weighted network design. We show a constant factor approximation for the directed feedback vertex set problem in graphs of bounded genus.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs -- Metric and Non-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently there has been increased interest in fitting generative graph models to real-world networks. In particular, Bl\"asius et al. have proposed a framework for systematic evaluation of the expressivity of random graph models. We extend this framework to Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs). This includes a family of graphs induced by non-metric distance functions which allow capturing more complex models of partial similarity between nodes as a basis of connection - as well as homogeneous and non-homogeneous feature spaces. As part of the extension, we develop schemes for estimating the multiplicative constant and the long-range parameter in the connection probability. Moreover, we devise an algorithm for sampling Minimum-Component-Distance GIRGs whose runtime is linear both in the number of vertices and in the dimension of the underlying geometric space. Our results provide evidence that GIRGs are more realistic candidates with respect to various graph features such as closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, local clustering coefficient, and graph effective diameter, while they face difficulties to replicate higher variance and more extreme values of graph statistics observed in real-world networks.</description>
