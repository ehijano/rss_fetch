      <title>Koopman analysis of CAT maps onto classical and quantum 2-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (CAT maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus (and on its dual space). Finally, we study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT maps from the viewpoint of the Koopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Topology and the Conformal Invariance of Nodal Lines in Two-Dimensional Active Scalar Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits a mysterious phenomenon. Numerical simulations have shown that the nodal isolines of certain scalars actively transported in the flow (eg, the vorticity in Navier-Stokes theory) obey Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), which indicates the presence of conformal invariance. Therefore, these turbulent isolines are somehow in the same class as cluster boundaries in equilibrium statistical mechanical models at criticality, such as critical percolation. In this paper, we propose that the inverse cascade is characterized by a local energy (or in some cases, enstrophy) flux field that spontaneously breaks time reversal invariance. The turbulent state consists of random constant flux domains, with the nodal isolines acting as domain walls where the local flux vanishes. The generalized circulation of the domains is proportional to a topological winding number. We argue that these turbulent states are gapped states, in analogy with quantum Hall systems. The turbulent flow consists of many strongly coupled vortices that are analogous to quasi-particles. The nodal isolines are associated with the gapless topological degrees of freedom in the flow, where scale invariance is enhanced to conformal invariance. We introduce a concrete model of this behavior using a two-dimensional effective theory involving the canonical Clebsch scalars. This theory has patch solutions that exhibit power law scaling. The fractional winding number associated with the patches can be related to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling dimension of the corresponding fluid theory. We argue that the fully developed inverse cascade is a scale invariant gas of these patches. This theory has a conformally invariant sector described by a Liouville conformal field theory whose central charge is fixed by the fractional winding number.</description>

      <title>Waveform proportionality and Taylor's law in coupled Lorenz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taylor's law (TL) describes a power-law relationship between the mean and variance of a quantity, a phenomenon observed across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite its ubiquity, the underlying mechanisms responsible for TL are not yet fully elucidated. In particular, the frequent empirical observation of TL with an exponent 2 warrants further investigation. In a previous study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 167202 (2025)], we hypothesized that synchronization contributes to the emergence of TL with an exponent 2. We validated this hypothesis using coupled oscillator models derived from a food chain model, the R\"ossler system, the Brusselator, and the Lorenz system. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrated that strong coupling leads to a form of synchronization wherein time series become proportional to each other, consequently resulting in TL with an exponent 2. Here, we extend our previous findings for the coupled Lorenz system and provide detailed calculations.</description>

      <title>LanTu: Dynamics-Enhanced Deep Learning for Eddy-Resolving Ocean Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting (especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>
