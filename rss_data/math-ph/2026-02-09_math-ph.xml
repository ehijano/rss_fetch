      <title>Derivation of the 3D quintic Gross--Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of Bose--Einstein condensates with three-body interactions in the Gross--Pitaevskii regime. We show that Bose--Einstein condensation is preserved under many-body evolution and that the condensate wavefunction evolves according to the quintic Gross--Pitaevskii equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which is energy critical. In particular, we show that the effective coupling constant is universal and depends only on a three-body scattering hypervolume.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>Unitarising measures for Kac-Moody algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact connected Lie group $G$ with dual Coxeter number $\check h$ and a level $\kappa&lt;-2\check h$, we introduce a probability measure $\nu_\kappa$ on the space of holomorphic $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb C}$-valued $(1,0)$-forms in $\mathbb D$, in relation to the K\"ahler geometry of the loop group of $G$ and the action of a pair of Kac--Moody algebras at respective levels $\kappa$ and $-2\check h-\kappa&gt;0$. We prove that $\nu_\kappa$ is characterised by a covariance property making rigorous sense of the formal path integral ``$\mathrm d\nu_\kappa(\gamma)=e^{-\check\kappa\mathscr{S}(\gamma)}D\gamma$", where $D\gamma$ is the non-existent Haar measure on the loop group and $\mathscr S$ is a K\"ahler potential for the right-invariant Kac--Moody metric. Infinitesimally, the covariance formula prescribes the Shapovalov forms of the Kac--Moody representations.</description>

      <title>On large-scale oceanic wind-drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier--Stokes equations in rotating spherical coordinates with constant density and eddy viscosity varying only with depth, and appropriate, physically motivated boundary conditions, we derive an asymptotic model for the description of non-equatorial wind-generated oceanic drift currents. We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy analysis and entropy stable DG methods for the shallow water moment equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the shallow water moment equations satisfy an auxiliary entropy conservation law, where the entropy function corresponds to the total energy. Additionally, we show that the classical Newtonian slip friction and Manning friction terms are entropy dissipative with respect to the developed entropy variables. The results from the continuous entropy analysis are used to construct an entropy stable and well-balanced nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the spatial approximation. Key to ensure the entropy stability of the scheme is the derivation of entropy conservative numerical fluxes that satisfy a discrete version of the entropy flux compatibility condition. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the scheme and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Purified Two-Relaxation-Time Lattice Boltzmann Method: Removing Ghost Modes from TRT for Enhanced Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-relaxation-time (TRT) lattice Boltzmann model is widely adopted for its simplicity and tunable boundary accuracy. However, its collision operator relaxes the full symmetric non-equilibrium component, implicitly retaining non-hydrodynamic ghost modes that degrade stability at high Reynolds numbers. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between ghost-mode filtering and regularization within the TRT framework. By decomposing the discrete velocity space into hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic subspaces, we prove that the TRT-regularized lattice Boltzmann (TRT-RLB) model is mathematically equivalent to the standard TRT model with ghost modes explicitly removed. This equivalence holds exactly for D2Q9 and D3Q19 lattices, where the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces are completely spanned by the physically relevant Hermite modes and identifiable ghost modes. Based on this finding, we propose the Purified TRT (P-TRT) model, which achieves regularization-level stability through simple algebraic ghost-mode subtraction rather than expensive tensor projections. For D2Q9, the non-equilibrium collision cost is reduced from 180 to 52 floating-point operations per node, a 71% reduction. Linear stability analysis in moment space further reveals that the P-TRT operator annihilates the ghost eigenvalue, proving its spectral radius is bounded above by that of standard TRT and that stability is governed exclusively by hydrodynamic modes. Benchmarks including the double shear layer at Re up to 10^7, Taylor--Green vortex decay, force-driven Poiseuille flow, and creeping flow past a square cylinder confirm that P-TRT preserves the stability, second-order accuracy, and zero-slip boundary properties of TRT-RLB while retaining the simplicity of the TRT family.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics of Conformable Semigroups via Classical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives involve a fractional parameter while preserving locality: on smooth functions they reduce to a classical derivative multiplied by an explicit weight. Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $\delta\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \[ \Psi(t)=\frac{t^\delta}{\delta}, \] and prove that every $C_0$--$\delta$--semigroup $\mathcal S_\delta$ admits the representation \[ \mathcal S_\delta(t)=\mathcal T(\Psi(t)), \] where $\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $\delta$--generator of $\mathcal S_\delta$ coincides with the generator of $\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=\Psi(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $\delta$--hypercyclicity and $\delta$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\delta}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $t &gt; 0$, let $\{\mathcal{H}^{(t)}_n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be the KPZ line ensemble with parameter $t$, satisfying the homogeneous $\mathbf{H}$-Brownian Gibbs property with $\mathbf{H}(x) =e^x$. We prove quantitative concentration estimates for the $n$th line $\mathcal{H}^{(t)}_n$ which yield the asymptotics $\mathcal{H}^{(t)}_n = n \log n + o(n^{3/4 + \epsilon})$ as $n \to \infty$. A key step in the proof is a general integration by parts formula for $\mathbf{H}$-Brownian Gibbs line ensembles which yields the identity $\mathbb{E} \exp(\mathcal{H}^{(t)}_{n + 1}(x) - \mathcal{H}^{(t)}_n (x)) = n t^{-1}$ for any $n, t, x$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and localisation in causally constrained quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.</description>

      <title>A global stability result for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a result of global stability for the equations of homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a torus of any dimension $d \in \{2,3,...\}$, with positive viscosity and resistivity. This result applies to the $C^\infty$ global solutions, with a conveniently defined decay property for large times; it is expressed by fully explicit estimates, formulated via $H^p$-type Sobolev norms of arbitrarily high order $p$. The present stability result is similar to that proposed by one of us for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation \cite{glosta}; it is derived from a suitable formulation of the MHD equations proposed in our previous work \cite{MHD}, emphasizing strong structural analogies with the NS case. A basic tool in the proof of the present stability result is a general theory of approximate solutions of the MHD Cauchy problem, that we developed in \cite{MHD} on the grounds of previous results on the NS equation \cite{smooth} and of the above structural similarities. We also introduce a class of Beltrami-type initial data for the MHD equations; although being arbitrarily large, these data produce global and decaying MHD solutions, fitting the framework of the present stability result. Comparisons with the previous literature on these subjects are performed.</description>

Abstract: Some well-known examples of constrained quantum systems commonly quantized via Feynman path integrals are re-examined using the notion of conditional integrators introduced in [1]. The examples yield some new perspectives on old results. As an interesting new application, the formalism is used to construct a physical model of average prime counting functions modeled as a constrained gamma process.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is a "2-graph" $\Gamma^2$ embedded in a 3d Cauchy slice $\Sigma$, which has equipped the structure of a discrete 2-groupoid. Upon such 2-graphs, we model the extended Wilson surface operators in 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's {\it measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows these 2-graph operators -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matrix gives it a categorical quasitriangularity structure, which we call the {\it cobraiding}. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group 2-gauge theories on the lattice. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables from it.</description>

      <title>In search of constitutive conditions in isotropic hyperelasticity: polyconvexity versus true-stress-true-strain monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polyconvexity of a strain-energy function is nowadays increasingly presented as the ultimate material stability condition for an idealized elastic response. While the mathematical merits of polyconvexity are clearly understood, its mechanical consequences have received less attention. In this contribution we contrast polyconvexity with the recently rediscovered true-stress-true-strain monotonicity (TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$) condition. By way of explicit examples, we show that neither condition by itself is strong enough to guarantee physically reasonable behavior for ideal isotropic elasticity. In particular, polyconvexity does not imply a monotone trajectory of the Cauchy stress in unconstrained uniaxial extension which TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ ensures. On the other hand, TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ does not impose a monotone Cauchy shear stress response in simple shear which is enforced by Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity and in turn polyconvexity. Both scenarios are proven through the construction of appropriate strain-energy functions. Consequently, a combination of polyconvexity, ensuring Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity, and TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ seems to be a viable solution to Truesdell's Hauptproblem. However, so far no isotropic strain-energy function has been identified that satisfies both constraints globally at the same time. Although we are unable to deliver a valid solution here, we provide several results that could prove helpful in the construction of such an exceptional strain-energy function.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic aspects of discrete periodic Toda flows</title>

Abstract: We construct a new algebraic linearization of the discrete periodic Toda flow by using Mumford's algebraic description of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. In particular, the discrete periodic Toda flow can be expressed in terms of the famous Gau{\ss} composition law for quadratic forms adapted to the framework of hyperelliptic curves by Cantor. One surprising consequence of our approach is a new integrality property for the discrete periodic Toda flow which leads to a $p$-adic description of the closely related periodic box-ball flow, which has very surprising connections to number theory.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quasinormal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift terms. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>From random matrices to systems of particles in interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of these expository notes is to give an introduction to random matrices for non-specialist of this topic focusing on the link between random matrices and systems of particles in interaction. We first recall some general results about the random matrix theory that create a link between random matrices and systems of particles through the knowledge of the law of the eigenvalues of certain random matrices models. We next focus on a continuous in time approach of random matrices called the Dyson Brownian motion. We detail some general methods to study the existence of system of particles in singular interaction and the existence of a mean field limit for these systems of particles. Finally, we present the main result of large deviations when studying the eigenvalues of random matrices. This method is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of certain models of random matrices can be viewed as log gases in dimension 1 or 2.</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions for the independence polynomial on restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalising the Heilman-Lieb Theorem from statistical physics, Chudnovsky and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97(3):350--357] showed that the univariate independence polynomial of any claw-free graph has all of its zeros on the negative real line. In this paper, we show that for any fixed subdivded claw $H$ and any $\Delta$, there is an open set $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ containing $[0, \infty)$ such that the independence polynomial of any $H$-free graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has all of its zeros outside of $F$. We also show that no such result can hold when $H$ is any graph other than a subdivided claw or if we drop the maximum degree condition.
  We also establish zero-free regions for the multivariate independence polynomial of $H$-free graphs of bounded degree when $H$ is a subdivided claw. The statements of these results are more subtle, but are again best possible in various senses.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Double-bosonization and Majid's conjecture (V): grafting of quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a grafting method to address Majid's conjecture, which enables the construction of a larger target quantum group by grafting two given smaller ones. This method is significant for advancing the understanding of the generation, classification, and construction of (quasi-)Hopf algebras. To pave the way for the grafting method, we first set up a multi-tensor product theory for generalized double-bosonization to acquire the necessary information on the braiding $R$-matrices (see \cite{HH2}). Beyond the perspective of braided monoidal categories arising from the representations of quantum subgroups, the grafting procedure necessitates incorporating structural information from root systems in Lie theory. This approach provides a one-stop strategy for resolving the generation problem in Majid's conjecture on quantum trees.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>
