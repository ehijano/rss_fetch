      <title>Rigidity of convex co-compact diagonal actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kleiner-Leeb and Quint showed that convex subsets in higher-rank symmetric spaces are very rigid compared to rank 1 symmetric spaces. Motivated by this, we consider convex subsets in products of proper CAT(0) spaces $X_1\times X_2$ and show that for any two convex co-compact actions $\rho_i(\Gamma)$ on $X_i$, where $i=1, 2$, if the diagonal action of $\Gamma$ on $X_1\times X_2$ via $\rho=(\rho_1, \rho_2)$ is also convex co-compact, then under a suitable condition, $\rho_1(\Gamma)$ and $\rho_2(\Gamma)$ have the same marked length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Boolean models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The union of the particles of a stationary Poisson process of compact (convex) sets in Euclidean space is called Boolean model and is a classical topic of stochastic geometry. In this paper, Boolean models in hyperbolic space are considered, where one takes the union of the particles of a stationary Poisson process in the space of compact (convex) subsets of the hyperbolic space. Geometric functionals such as the volume of the intersection of the Boolean model with a compact convex observation window are studied. In particular, the asymptotic behavior for balls with increasing radii as observation windows is investigated. Exact and asymptotic formulas for expectations, variances, and covariances are shown and univariate and multivariate central limit theorems are derived. Compared to the Euclidean framework, some new phenomena can be observed.</description>

      <title>Favard length and quantitative rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Favard length of a Borel set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is the average length of its orthogonal projections. We prove that if $E$ is Ahlfors 1-regular and it has large Favard length, then it contains a big piece of a Lipschitz graph. This gives a quantitative version of the Besicovitch projection theorem. As a corollary, we answer questions of David and Semmes and of Peres and Solomyak. We also make progress on Vitushkin's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigidities of Isoperimetric inequality under nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sharp isoperimetric inequality for non-compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth has been obtained in increasing generality with different approaches in a number of contributions [arXiv:1812.05022, arXiv:2012.09490, arXiv:2009.13717, arXiv:2103.08496] culminated by Balogh and Kristaly [arXiv:2012.11862] covering also m.m.s.'s verifying the non-negative Ricci curvature condition in the synthetic sense of Lott, Sturm and Villani. In sharp contrast with the compact case of positive Ricci curvature, for a large class of spaces including weighted Riemannian manifolds, no complete characterisation of the equality cases is present in the literature.
  The scope of this note is to settle this problem by proving, in the same generality of [arXiv:2012.11862], that the equality in the isoperimetric inequality can be attained only by metric balls. Whenever this happens the space is forced, in a measure theoretic sense, to be a cone.
  Our result applies to different frameworks yielding as corollaries new rigidity results: it extend to weighted Riemannian manifold the rigidity results of [arXiv:2009.13717], it extend to general $\mathsf{RCD}$ spaces the rigidity results of [arXiv:2201.04916] and finally applies also to the Euclidean setting by proving that that optimisers in the anisotropic and weighted isoperimetric inequality for Euclidean cones are necessarily the Wulff shapes.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>On the collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds and K\"ahler-Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics and of Kahler-Ricci flows on fiber spaces where the base is smooth. We identify the collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the Kahler-Ricci flow when the divisorial part of the discriminant locus has simple normal crossings. In either setting, we also obtain an explicit bound for the real codimension 2 Hausdorff measure of the Cheeger-Colding singular set, and identify a sufficient condition from birational geometry to understand the metric behavior of the limiting metric on the base.</description>
