      <title>Nested State and Degradation Estimation of a Satellite Battery with In-flight Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-ion batteries are essential for the energy supply of satellites. The accurate estimation of their states is important for
  the reliable and safe operation in space. This paper introduces a new algorithm for the estimation of SOC and SOH.
  The multi-timescale algorithm combines Kalman filters and physics-based models for batteries. We use a P2D model
  combined with a degradation model that describes capacity fading due to SEI growth. The state estimation algorithm
  combines two extended Kalman filters for the two states evolving on different timescales, with one filter nested within
  the other one. We test the algorithm with synthetic data as well as with in-flight data from Japanese satellite REIMEI.
  The algorithm adequately estimates the SOC and SOH in both cases. Furthermore it gives insight into the reliability of
  the chosen model.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization from Circularly Polarized Light Induced Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a spin polarization can be generated through the photo-induced electron transfer of an achiral donor-acceptor complex following chiral light excitation. In particular, we illustrate the basic energetic and symmetry requirements for chirality induced spin selectivity where the chirality emerges from the electronic degrees of freedom following excitation with circularly polarized light. We study this effect in a simple model of a metalloporphyrin complex with an axial acceptor ligand using quantum mechanical rate theories and numerical simulations. We find that the spin polarization emerges due to the selective excitation of a ring current within the porphryin, breaking the degeneracy of the two degenerate spin states. The resultant spin polarization increases with the spin orbit coupling between the metal in the porphyrin and the axial ligand, and is transient, with a lifetime dependent on the rate of dephasing from the Jahn-Teller distortion mode. This proposed effect should be observable in spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Ionic Current Rectification in Short Unipolar Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With controlled ionic current rectification (ICR) achieved through a strategically designed non-uniform surface charge distribution, short unipolar nanopores exhibit promising applications in nanofluidic sensors, ionic circuits, and ion amplifiers. By systematically investigating how the charged length on inner pore walls modulates ion transport, we found that both the maximum ICR degree and the corresponding charged-length proportion were influenced by nanopore parameters and simulation conditions. For 100 nm-long unipolar nanopores, the highest ICR degree is obtained at a charged-length proportion of ~0.3, due to the corresponding most significant ion enrichment and depletion inside the nanopore under opposite biases. This charged-length proportion of ~0.3 consistently appears as a characteristic value across most considered cases. For short unipolar nanopores, the presence of exterior surface charges significantly enhances the ICR degree by facilitating ion transport through nanopores. The effective widths of charged regions beyond nanopore borders on outer surfaces exhibit direct proportionality to the pore diameter, surface charge density, and applied voltage, and inverse proportionality to the pore length and salt concentration. Our research may provide useful guidance for the design of unipolar nanopores and porous membranes incorporating such charge configurations.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Electroosmotic Flow through Short Nanopores by Charged Exterior Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroosmotic flow (EOF) through nanoporous membranes has broad applications in micro- and nanofluidic systems, particularly in biomedical diagnostics and chemical analysis. The use of short nanopores enables high fluid flux, and the presence of exterior surface charges can further enhance ion flux through short nanopores. Here, systematic simulations are conducted to explore the modulation of EOF by exterior surface charges. Our results indicate that charged exterior surfaces can provide an additional effective pathway for fluid flow, significantly increasing both the EOF velocity and output pressure. By analyzing the dependence of EOF velocity on the area of the charged exterior surface, we derive the effective width (Lcs_eff) of the charged ring region extending beyond the pore boundary. This parameter is quantitatively examined under various nanopore configurations and applied conditions. Lcs_eff is found to be proportional to the pore diameter, surface charge density, and applied voltage, while inversely proportional to pore length and salt concentration. These findings provide valuable insights into the modulation of EOF by exterior surface charges and offer theoretical guidance for optimizing the structural and functional properties of nanoporous membranes in practical applications of EOF.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of mono-, di-, and trivalent cations in electric double layers: a molecular dynamic investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic behaviors, including ion distributions and hydration characteristics at solid-liquid interfaces, are important research interests in many important applications, such as electric double-layer capacitors and water lubrication. Here, we systematically investigated the concentration distributions, hydration numbers, and screening properties of Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and La3+ ions inside electric double layers (EDLs) at various charge densities. For the surface charge density weaker than -0.16 C m-2, monovalent cations mainly accumulate in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). As the charge density magnitude increases, monovalent cations start to dehydrate and migrate to the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), following the order of K+, Na+, and Li+. This size-dependent behavior arises from the lower hydration energy of larger ions. While for the di- and trivalent ions, no obvious IHP appears. Based on ion distributions, the screening effect of counterions on surface charges is evaluated by analyzing the net charge distributions. As the charge density changes from 0 to -0.32 C m-2, due to the stronger accumulation of cations in EDLs, the location of the neutral plane changes from ~1.2 to ~0.4 nm. When the charge density reaches a threshold, excessive accumulation of cations can induce charge inversion. The threshold value and the maximum reversed charge are found to correlate with the ion size, cation valence, and concentration.</description>

      <title>Measurement and assignment of E-symmetry states in the 6010-6110 cm$^{-1}$ and 8940-9150 cm$^{-1}$ ranges of methane using optical frequency comb double-resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use sub-Doppler optical-optical double-resonance (OODR) spectroscopy with a 3.3 ${\mu}$m single-frequency pump and a cavity-enhanced 1.65 ${\mu}$m comb probe to measure 33 ladder-type (3${\nu}$${_3}$ ${\leftarrow}$ ${\nu}$${_3}$) and 8 V-type (2${\nu}$${_3}$) transitions in the 5880-6090 cm$^{-1}$ range of methane, reaching states with rotational E symmetry in the region of the P6 and P4 polyads, respectively. We assign the ladder-type transitions using new Hamiltonian predictions and the ExoMol line list, and the V-type transitions using the new Hamiltonian, ExoMol, HITRAN2020, and the WKLMC line lists. While 7 of the states in the 3${\nu}$${_3}$ range have been previously observed either in earlier OODR work (without cavity enhancement) with 1.5 MHz accuracy or in FTIR measurements of cold bands with 150 MHz resolution, the states reported here have uncertainties down to 150 kHz (5 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ cm$^{-1}$). The E-symmetry states exhibit first-order Stark splitting, which will be reported in our future work.</description>

      <title>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description>

      <title>On the role of nuclear quantum effects on the stability of peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) arising from the light mass of hydrogen can influence the structure and stability of hydrogen-bonded biomolecules, yet their role in determining peptide and protein folding remains unclear. Experiments show that substituting H$_2$O with D$_2$O often stabilizes folded states, but the microscopic mechanism associated with this phenomena remains unresolved. Through ab initio-level path-integral molecular dynamics simulations enabled by machine-learning interatomic potentials, we address the fundamental question of the role of NQEs in peptides by investigating both their overall impact and isotope substitution effects. Overall, NQEs systematically destabilize compact three-dimensional structures across peptide systems, independent of secondary structure type or side-chain interactions. Contrary to the conventional picture that places central importance on hydrogen bonds, we find that the dominant destabilization instead arises from the quantum C-H vibrations. In addition, we reveal microscopic insights into the stabilization of folded peptides upon H$_2$O to D$_2$O substitution, showing that the H/D isotope substitution of active peptide hydrogens, previously considered unimportant, produces free-energy changes within the range of experimentally observed shifts. These findings provide a new interpretation of isotope effects in biological systems, indicating that seemingly small H$\to$D substitutions within peptides can be as important as, or even outweigh, solvent contributions.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in dipolar liquids: from an exactly solvable model in the large-dimensional limit to finite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A medium, liquid in its positional degrees of freedom, exhibits in real space a homogeneous single-particle density and an isotropic linear response to perturbations of the density field. Under the hypothesis that, if the anisotropic dipolar interaction is a weak perturbation of the isotropic reference system potential, this condition persists in a dipolar liquid for any dipole configuration, a regularization of the dipolar potential can be introduced. This developments lead to the definition of a screened dipolar interaction that is isotropic, short-ranged, and ferroelectric-like. In a classical density functional theory framework the model is exactly solvable in the limit of infinite dimensions, whereas approximations can be obtained in the case of finite dimensions $d \geq 3$ in the optimized cluster expansion scheme. In both cases, it is shown that the system can support a ferroelectric phase transition. The study relates the emergence of ferroelectricity in dipolar liquids to a constitutive property of the liquid state, i.e. annealed positional disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been proposed, among many other applications, as a efficient tool for the separation of atomic and molecular species and their corresponding isotopes, given the confinement provided by their subnanometric dimensions. In this work we present three dimensional quantum wave packet calculations revealing an enhancement in the quantum transport in bilayer over monolayer graphdiyne membranes, one of the most popular 2D materials which is commonly employed for this purpose. Besides, resonances emerge superimposed over the typical monolayer profile for transmission probabilities, a feature that is general to other bilayer nanoporous 2D heterostructures and that shows a strong dependence on the interlayer separation.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Supported Nanoparticles: Decoupling Energy Accuracy from Structural Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supported nanoparticle catalysts are widely used in the chemical industry. Computational modeling of supported nanoparticles based on density functional theory (DFT) often involves structural searches of stable local minimum energy configurations and molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature. These are computationally demanding tasks that are intractable within DFT for large systems. In the last two decades, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been successfully used to substantially increase the size and time scales accessible to simulations that retain DFT accuracy. However, training reliable MLIPs is non-trivial as it requires many costly DFT calculations. Recently, several universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) have been developed, which are trained on large datasets that cover a wide range of molecules and materials. Here, we benchmark the accuracy and the efficiency of these uMLIPs in describing Cu nanoparticles supported on Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces against our domain-specific DP-UniAlCu model. We find that the MACE-OMAT can reproduce reasonably well the low-energy configurations found in global optimization at an energy accuracy comparable to DP-UniAlCu. Interestingly, the MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M model, which exhibits larger deviations in the binding energies, can find even more stable configurations than the other two models in some supported nanoparticle sizes, showing its capability in structure exploration. For MD simulations, MACE-OMAT and MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M can qualitatively reproduce the mean-squared displacements of Cu atoms (MSD$_\mathrm{Cu}$) predicted by DP-UniAlCu, albeit at roughly two orders of magnitude higher cost. We demonstrate that the uMLIPs can be very useful in simulating supported nanoparticles even without any fine-tuning, though their reduced efficiency remains a limiting factor for large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Mapping vacancy and bonding electron distributions around aluminium nanovoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All materials have defects and many contain nanostructures, both of which disrupt chemical bonding - the basis of materials properties. No experimental measurements of bonding electron distributions associated with defects and nanostructures have ever been possible. We present a method enabling such measurements and interrogate nanovoids surrounded by vacancies - the most fundamental of nanostructures and defects - in aluminium. We measure the volume of a vacancy with 3% uncertainty and map vacancy concentrations surrounding nanovoids with nanometre resolution in three dimensions where previously only two-dimensional mapping was possible. We discover that radiation-damaged voids can "heal". Our bonding measurements are depth-resolved, vacancy-sensitive, and agree with density functional theory. This work opens bonding electron density measurements to inhomogeneous nanostructured multi-phased materials so that the electronic origins of phenomena such as strengthening, weakening, interface functionality, solute diffusion and phase transformations within them may be revealed.</description>

      <title>Geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Teaching Language Models Mechanistic Explainability Through Arrow-Pushing</title>

Abstract: Chemical reaction mechanisms provide crucial insight into synthesizability, yet current Computer-Assisted Synthesis Planning (CASP) systems lack mechanistic grounding. We introduce a computational framework for teaching language models to predict chemical reaction mechanisms through arrow pushing formalism, a century-old notation that tracks electron flow while respecting conservation laws. We developed MechSMILES, a compact textual format encoding molecular structure and electron flow, and trained language models on four mechanism prediction tasks of increasing complexity using mechanistic reaction datasets, such as mech-USPTO-31k and FlowER. Our models achieve more than 95\% top-3 accuracy on elementary step prediction and scores that surpass 73\% on mech-USPTO-31k, and 93\% on FlowER dataset for the retrieval of complete reaction mechanisms on our hardest task. This mechanistic understanding enables three key applications. First, our models serve as post-hoc validators for CASP systems, filtering chemically implausible transformations. Second, they enable holistic atom-to-atom mapping that tracks all atoms, including hydrogens. Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species. By grounding predictions in physically meaningful electron moves that ensure conservation of mass and charge, this work provides a pathway toward more explainable and chemically valid computational synthesis planning, while providing an architecture-agnostic framework for the benchmarking of mechanism prediction.</description>

      <title>Relating the dynamics of photo de-mixing in mixed bromide-iodide perovskites to ionic and electronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of reversible de-mixing phenomena in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination is one of the most challenging as well as intriguing aspects of this class of materials. On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation. Our comprehensive analysis of transport, phase and optical properties of mixed-halide perovskites pro-vides guidelines for future materials design as well as for the more general fundamental understanding of light-induced ionic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Adsorption energies are necessary but not sufficient to identify good catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a core technology for green chemical synthesis and electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis is central to decarbonization strategies aimed at combating climate change. In this context, computational and machine learning driven catalyst discovery has emerged as a major research focus. These approaches frequently use the thermodynamic overpotential, calculated from adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, as a key parameter in their analysis. In this paper, we explore the large-scale applicability of such overpotential estimates for identifying good catalyst candidates by using datasets from the Open Catalyst Project (OC20 and OC22). We start by quantifying the uncertainty in predicting adsorption energies using \textit{ab initio} methods and find that $\sim$0.3-0.5 eV is a conservative estimate for a single adsorption energy prediction. We then compute the overpotential of all materials in the OC20 and OC22 datasets for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We find that while the overpotential allows the identification of known good catalysts such as platinum and iridium oxides, the uncertainty is large enough to misclassify a broad fraction of the datasets as ``good'', which limits its value as a screening criterion. These results question the reliance on overpotential estimation as a primary evaluation metric to sort through catalyst candidates and calls for a shift in focus in the computational catalysis and machine learning communities towards other metrics such as synthesizability, stability, lifetime or affordability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our quantum annealing computations of the permanent electric dipole
  moments of several molecules. By applying an electric field as a perturbation and measuring the
  corresponding energy responses, the molecular electric dipole moments are obtained numerically
  through the finite field method. The ground-state electronic wavefunctions and energies are obtained
  using the quantum annealer eignsolver algorithm. This work provides a pathway for the computation
  of molecular properties in the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic corrections to electric quadrupole transition rates in H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive formulas and perform calculations of nonadiabatic corrections to rates of electric quadrupole transitions in the hydrogen molecule. These corrections can be represented in terms of the quadrupole moment curve $D^{(1)}(R)$, similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer one, $D^{(0)}(R)$, derived originally by Wolniewicz. Numerical results change E2 transition rates for the fundamental band by as much as 0.4 - 12\% depending on rotational quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>More is different: How chemical complexity influences stability in high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.</description>
