      <title>Frequency-Histogram Coarse Graining in Elementary Cellular Automata and 2D CA</title>

Abstract: Cellular automata and other discrete dynamical systems have long been studied as models of emergent complexity. Recently, neural cellular automata have been proposed as models to investigate the emerge of a more general artificial intelligence, thanks to their propensity to support properties such as self-organization, emergence, and open-endedness. However, understanding emergent complexity in large scale systems is an open challenge. How can the important computations leading to emergent complex structures and behaviors be identified? In this work, we systematically investigate a form of dimensionality reduction for 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional cellular automata based on coarse-graining of macrostates into smaller blocks. We discuss selected examples and provide the entire exploration of coarse graining with different filtering levels in the appendix (available also digitally at this link: https://s4nyam.github.io/eca88/). We argue that being able to capture emergent complexity in AI systems may pave the way to open-ended evolution, a plausible path to reach artificial general intelligence.</description>
