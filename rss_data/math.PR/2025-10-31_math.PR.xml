      <title>A note on the Littlewood-Offord problem for discrete log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the famous Littlewood-Offord problem when Bernoulli distributions are replaced with discrete log-concave distributions. A variant of the Littlewood-Offord problem for arithmetic progressions, as well as an entropic version, is also discussed. Along the way, we recover and extend a result of Madiman and Woo (2015) on the entropy power inequality for discrete uniform distributions.</description>

      <title>Dixie cup problem in an interlacing process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double Dixie cup problem of D.J. Newman and L. Shepp is a well-known variant of the coupon collector problem, where the object of study is the number of coupons that a collector has to buy in order to complete m sets of all N existing different coupons. In this paper we consider the case where the coupons distribution is a mixture of two different distributions, where the coupons from the first distribution are far rarer than the ones coming from the second. We apply a Poissonization technique, as well as well known results and techniques from our previous work, to derive the asymptotics (leading term) of the expectation of the above random variable as N goes to infinity for large classes of distributions. As it turns out, both distributions contribute to this result. The leading asymptotics of the rising moments of the aforementioned random variable are also discussed. We conclude by generalizing the problem to the case where the family of coupons is a mixture of j subfamilies.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic approach to the parabolic normalized p-Laplacian obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a probabilistic representation for the solution of the parabolic obstacle problem associated with the normalized $p$-Laplacian. We introduce a zero-sum stochastic tug-of-war game with noise in a space-time cylinder, where one player has the option to stop the game at any time to collect a payoff given by an obstacle function. We prove that the value functions of this game exist, satisfy a dynamic programming principle, and converge uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the continuous obstacle problem as the step size $\varepsilon$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Generalized Divergence Measures and Weak Convergence for the Sets of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the asymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence and symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence from two probability measures to the case of two sets of probability measures. We establish some fundamental properties of these generalized divergences, including a duality formula and a Pinsker-type inequality. Furthermore, convergence results are derived for both the generalized asymmetric and symmetric divergences, as well as for weak convergence under sublinear expectations.</description>

      <title>Quenched coalescent for diploid population models with selfing and overlapping generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.</description>

      <title>Directed distances in bipolar-oriented triangulations: exact exponents and scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study longest and shortest directed paths in the following natural model of directed random planar maps: the uniform infinite bipolar-oriented triangulation (UIBOT), which is the local limit of uniform bipolar-oriented triangulations around a typical edge. We construct the Busemann function which measures directed distance to $\infty$ along a natural interface in the UIBOT. We show that in the case of longest (resp.\ shortest) directed paths, this Busemann function converges in the scaling limit to a $2/3$-stable L\'evy process (resp.\ a $4/3$-stable L\'evy process).
  We also prove up-to-constants bounds for directed distances in finite bipolar-oriented triangulations sampled from a Boltzmann distribution, and for size-$n$ cells in the UIBOT. These bounds imply that in a typical subset of the UIBOT with $n$ edges, longest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/4}$ and shortest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/8}$. These results give the scaling dimensions for discretizations of the (hypothetical) $\sqrt{4/3}$-directed Liouville quantum gravity metrics.
  The main external input in our proof is the bijection of Kenyon-Miller-Sheffield-Wilson (2015). We do not use any continuum theory. We expect that our techniques can also be applied to prove similar results for directed distances in other random planar map models and for longest increasing subsequences in pattern-avoiding permutations.</description>

      <title>Time-changed generalized fractional Skellam process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two time-changed variants of the generalized fractional Skellam process. These are obtained by time-changing the generalized fractional Skellam process with an independent L\'evy subordinator with finite moments of any order and its inverse, respectively. We call the introduced processes the time-changed generalized fractional Skellam process-I (TCGFSP-I) and the time-changed generalized fractional Skellam process-II (TCGFSP-II), respectively. The probability generating function, moment generating function, moments, factorial moments, variance, covariance, {\it etc.}, are derived for the TCGFSP-I. We obtain a variant of the law of the iterated logarithm for it and establish its long-range dependence property. Several special cases of the TCGFSP-I are considered, and the associated system of governing differential equations is obtained. Later, some distributional properties and particular cases are discussed for the TCGFSP-II.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial perspective on the Kemeny constant and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an irreducible transition matrix on a finite state space $V$. For a Markov chain $C=(C_k,k\geq 0)$ with transition matrix $M$, let $\tau^{\geq 1}_u$ denote the first positive hitting time of $u$ by $C$, and $\rho$ the unique invariant measure of $M$. Kemeny proved that if $X$ is sampled according to $\rho$ independently of $C$, the expected value of the first positive hitting time of $X$ by $C$ does not depend on the starting state of the chain: all the values $(E(\tau^{\geq 1}_X~|~C_0=u), u \in V)$ are equal. \par
  In this paper, we show that this property follows from a more general result: the generating function $\sum_{v\in V}E(x^{\tau_v^{\geq 1}}~|~C_0=u)\det(Id-xM^{(v)})$ is independent of the starting state $u$, where $M^{(v)}$ is obtained from $M$ by deleting the row and column corresponding to the state $v$. The factors appearing in this generating function are: first, the probability generating function of $\tau^{\geq 1}_v$, and second, the sequence of determinants $(det(Id-xM^{(v)}),v\in V),$ which, for $x=1$, is known to be proportional to the invariant measure $(\rho_u,u\in V)$.
  From this property, we deduce several further results, including relations involving higher moments of $\tau_X^{\geq 1}$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Strict monotonicity of critical points in independent long-range percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider independent long-range percolation models on locally finite vertex-transitive graphs. Using coupling ideas we prove strict monotonicity of the critical points with respect to local perturbations in the connection function, thereby improving upon previous results obtained via the classical essential enhancement method of Aizenman and Grimmett in several ways. In particular, our approach allows us to work under minimal assumptions, namely shift-invariance and summability of the connection function, and it applies to both undirected and directed bond percolation models.</description>

      <title>Conditioning random points by the number of vertices of their convex hull: the bi-pointed case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pick $N$ random points $U_1,\cdots,U_{N}$ independently and uniformly in a triangle ABC with area 1, and take the convex hull of the set $\{A,B,U_1,\cdots,U_{N}\}$. The boundary of this convex hull is a convex chain $V_0=B,V_1,\cdots,$ $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)}$, $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)+1}=A$ with random size $\mathbf{n}(N)$. The first aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of this chain, conditional on $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$, when both $n$ and $m=N-n$ go to $+\infty$. We prove a phase transition: if $m=\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$ where $\lambda&gt;0$, this chain converges in probability for the Hausdorff topology to an (explicit) hyperbola ${\cal H}_\lambda$ as $n\to+\infty$, while, if $m=o(n)$, the limit shape is a parabola. We prove that this hyperbola is solution to an optimization problem: among all concave curves ${\cal C}$ in $ABC$ (incident with $A$ and $B$), ${\cal H}_\lambda$ is the unique curve maximizing the functional ${\cal C}\mapsto {\sf Area}({\cal C})^{\lambda} {\sf L}({\cal C})^3$ where ${\sf L}({\cal C})$ is the affine perimeter of ${\cal C}$. We also give the logarithm expansion of the probability ${\bf Q}^{\triangle \bullet\bullet}_{n,\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor}$, that $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$ when $N=n+\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$.
  Take a compact convex set $\mathbf{K}$ with area 1 in the plane, and denote by ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$ the probability of the event that the convex hull of $n+m$ iid uniform points in $\mathbf{K}$ is a polygon with $n$ vertices.
  We provide some results and conjectures regarding the asymptotic logarithm expansion of ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$, as well as results and conjectures concerning limit shape theorems, conditional on this event.
  These results and conjectures generalize B\'ar\'any's results, who treated the case $\lambda=0$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fuss-Catalan thresholds in graph bootstrap percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graph bootstrap percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$. For all $r \ge 5$, we locate the sharp $K_r$-percolation threshold $p_c \sim (\gamma n)^{-1/\lambda}$, solving a problem of Balogh, Bollob\'as and Morris. The case $r=3$ is the classical graph connectivity threshold, and the threshold for $r=4$ was found using strong connections with the well-studied $2$-neighbor dynamics from statistical physics. When $r \ge 5$, such connections break down, and the process exhibits much richer behavior. The constants $\lambda=\lambda(r)$ and $\gamma=\gamma(r)$ in $p_c$ are determined by a class of $\left({r\choose2}-1\right)$-ary tree-like graphs, which we call $K_r$-tree witness graphs. These graphs are associated with the most efficient ways of adding a new edge in the $K_r$-dynamics, and they can be counted using the Fuss-Catalan numbers. Also, in the subcritical setting, we determine the asymptotic number of edges added to ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$, showing that the edge density increases only by a constant factor, whose value we identify.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Arcsine Law: Exact Two-Time Statistics of the Occupation Time in Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occupation times quantify how long a stochastic process remains in a region, and their single-time statistics are famously given by the arcsine law for Brownian and L\'evy processes. By contrast, two-time occupation statistics, which directly probe temporal correlations and aging, have resisted exact characterization beyond renewal processes. In this Letter we derive exact results for generic one-dimensional jump processes, a central framework for intermittent and discretely sampled dynamics. Using generalized Wiener-Hopf methods, we obtain the joint distribution of occupation time and position, the aged occupation-time law, and the autocorrelation function. In the continuous-time scaling limit, universal features emerge that depend only on the tail of the jump distribution, providing a starting point for exploring aging transport in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Deconvolution of distribution functions without integral transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the recovery of the distribution function $F_X$ of a random variable $X$ that is subject to an independent additive random error $\varepsilon$. To be precise, it is assumed that the target variable $X$ is available only in the form of a blurred surrogate $Y = X + \varepsilon$. The distribution function $F_Y$ then corresponds to the convolution of $F_X$ and $F_\varepsilon$, so that the reconstruction of $F_X$ is some kind of deconvolution problem. Those have a long history in mathematics and various approaches have been proposed in the past. Most of them use integral transforms or matrix algorithms. The present article avoids these tools and is entirely confined to the domain of distribution functions. Our main idea relies on a transformation of a first kind to a second kind integral equation. Thereof, starting with a right-lateral discrete target and error variable, a representation for $F_X$ in terms of available quantities is obtained, which facilitates the unbiased estimation through a $Y$-sample. It turns out that these results even extend to cases in which $X$ is not discrete. Finally, in a general setup, our approach gives rise to an approximation for $F_X$ as a certain Neumann sum. The properties of this sum are briefly examined theoretically and visually. The paper is concluded with a short discussion of operator theoretical aspects and an outlook on further research. Various plots underline our results and illustrate the capabilities of our functions with regard to estimation.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of stationary measures for random surface dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find conditions for stationary measures of random dynamical systems on surfaces having dissipative diffeomorphisms to be absolutely continuous. These conditions involve a uniformly expanding on average property in the future (UEF) and past (UEP). Our results can cover random dynamical systems generated by "very dissipative" diffeomorphisms and perturbations of volume preserving surface diffeomorphisms. For example, we can consider a random dynamical system on $\mathbb{T}^2$ generated by perturbations of a pair of non-commuting infinite order toral automorphisms with any arbitrary single diffeomorphism. In this case, we conclude that stationary measures are either atomic or absolutely continuous. We also obtain an orbit classification and equidistribution result.</description>

      <title>Intersections of branching random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random walks on $\Z^8$ indexed by the infinite invariant tree, which consists of an infinite spine and finite random trees attached to it on both sides. We establish the precise order of the non-intersection probability between one walk indexed by one side of the tree, and an independent one indexed by both sides of an independent tree. This is analogous to the result by Lawler from the '90s for two independent simple random walks on $\Z^4$. We also prove a weak law of large numbers for the branching capacity of the range of a branching random walk.</description>

      <title>On the passage times of self-similar Gaussian processes on curved boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T_{c,\beta}$ denote the smallest $t\ge1$ that a continuous, self-similar Gaussian process with self-similarity index $\alpha&gt;0$ moves at least $\pm c t^\beta$ units. We prove that: (i) If $\beta&gt;\alpha$, then $T_{c,\beta}=\infty$ with positive probability; (ii) If $\beta&lt;\alpha$ and $X$ is strongly locally nondeterministic in the sense of Pitt (1978), then $T_{c,\beta}$ has moments of all order; and (iii) If $\beta=\alpha$ and $X$ is strongly locally nondeterministic in the sense of Pitt (1978), then there exists a continuous, strictly decreasing function $\lambda:(0\,,\infty)\to(0\,,\infty)$ such that $\mathrm{E}(T_{c,\beta}^\mu)$ is finite when $0&lt;\mu&lt;\lambda(c)$ and infinite when $\mu&gt;\lambda(c)$. Together these results extend a celebrated theorem of Breiman (1967) and Shepp (1967) for passage times of a Brownian motion on the critical square-root boundary. We briefly discuss two examples: One about fractional Brownian motion, and another about a family of linear stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-Fragmentation Duality of Infinitely Exchangeable Partitions from Coupled Mixed Poisson Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality of Jim Pitman's (1999) , originally established for the PD($\alpha$,$\theta$) laws of Pitman and Marc Yor (1997), resolving a problem open for over two decades. Our framework extends the duality to processes driven by arbitrary non-negative L\'evy subordinators and, for the first time, to multi-group settings with coupled dynamics. The solution is a novel four-component system built from a hierarchical mixed Poisson process, which circumvents the intractable analysis on traditional partition spaces. Crucially, this construction resolves a foundational impasse for continuous-time processes highlighted by Bertoin (2006 ch4, p.213): where time-reversal fails, we introduce "simultaneous\ structural\ duality", where fragmentation and coalescence evolve in physical time while maintaining a pointwise dual relationship via coupled subordinators. This provides a generative framework where the dynamics of mutation and the structure of ancestry unfold together in real time. This architecture yields exact compound Poisson representations and explicit joint laws for a new class of coupled processes, including structured $\Lambda$-coalescents and $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Scaling limit of stochastic Box-Ball systems and PushTASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Box-Ball System (SBBS), a probabilistic cellular automaton that generalizes the classic Takahashi-Satsuma Box-Ball System. In SBBS, particles are transported by a carrier with a fixed capacity that may fail to pick up any given particle with a fixed probability $\epsilon$. This model interpolates between two known integrable systems: the Box-Ball System (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$) and the PushTASEP (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 1$). We show that the long-term behavior of SBBS is governed by isolated particles and the occasional emergence of short solitons, which can form longer solitons but are more likely to fall apart. More precisely, we first show that all particles are isolated except for a $1/\sqrt{n}$-fraction of times in any given $n$ steps, and solitons keep forming for this fraction of times. We then show that under diffusive scaling, both SBBS (for any carrier capacity) and PushTASEP converge weakly to semimartingale reflecting Brownian Motions (SRBMs) on the Weyl chamber with explicit covariance and reflection matrices, which are consistent with the microscale relations between these systems. The reflection matrix for SBBS is determined by how 2-solitons behave and exhibit ``solitonic bias'' visible in the diffusive scale. Our proof relies on a new, extended SRBM invariance principle that we develop in this work. This principle can handle processes with complex boundary behavior that can be written as "overdetermined" Skorokhod decompositions, which is crucial for analyzing the complex solitonic interaction in SBBS. We believe this tool may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Random walks with echoed steps I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random walk with echoed steps (RWES) is a process $\{\tilde{S}_n\}_{n\geq1}=\{\tilde{X}_1+\cdots+\tilde{X}_n\}_{n\geq1}$ that inserts memory and echo into an ordinary random walk (ORW) with i.i.d. steps, $X_1+\cdots+X_n$. The RWES is defined recursively as follows. Let $\tilde{S}_1=X_1$. With probability $1-p$, the $n$-th increment of the RWES follows that of the ORW, $\tilde{X}_n=X_n$. Otherwise, $\tilde{X}_n$ is set as a random echo of a uniform sample of the past steps $\tilde{X}_1,\dots,\tilde{X}_{n-1}$ determined by a random factor $\xi_n$. Namely, $\tilde{X}_n=\xi_n\tilde{X}_{\mathcal{U}[n]}$ with probability $p$, where $\mathcal{U}[n]\sim$Uniform$\{1,\dots,n-1\}$. The RWES is a broad generalization of the elephant random walk and of the positively/negatively/unbalanced step-reinforced random walks. We determine strong convergences of $\tilde{S}$ when the echo law $\xi$ is non-negative. The rates of convergence are determined by the product $p\mathbb{E}\xi$ and exhibit a phase transition with critical value at $p\mathbb{E}\xi=1$. Highlight that in its super-critical regime, the RWES has super-linear scaling exponents --observed for the first time in this type of random walks with memory--. We provide Laws of Large Numbers, conditions for the convergence of $\tilde{S}$ around its mean towards random series and provide some distributional properties of the limits. Our approach relies on the interpretation of the model in terms of continuous time branching random walks, random recursive trees, P\'olya urns, and associated martingales.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator, and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures with Tikhonov regularization. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance, and study some of its finite-sample concentration properties. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</description>

      <title>Approximating the signature of Brownian motion for high order SDE simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The signature is a collection of iterated integrals describing the "shape" of a path. It appears naturally in the Taylor expansions of controlled differential equations and, as a consequence, is arguably the central object within rough path theory. In this paper, we will consider the signature of Brownian motion with time, and present both new and recently developed approximations for some of its integrals. Since these integrals (or equivalent L\'{e}vy areas) are nonlinear functions of the Brownian path, they are not Gaussian and known to be challenging to simulate. To conclude the paper, we will present some applications of these approximations to the high order numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs).</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation from local measurements for a class of stochastic Burgers equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deal with a class of semilinear SPDEs driven by space-time white noise that includes the one dimensional stochastic Burgers equation. Such equations can have nonlocal and quadratic nonlinearities. We consider the problem of estimation of the diffusivity parameter in front of the second-order spatial derivative. Based on local observations in space, we study the estimator derived in [Altmeyer, Rei\ss , Ann. Appl. Probab.(2021)] for linear stochastic heat equation that has also been used in [Altmeyer, Cialenco, Pasemann, Bernoulli (2023)] to cover certain class of semilinear SPDEs including stochastic Burgers equations driven by trace class noise. The space-time white noise case we consider has also relevant physical motivations. After we establish new regularity results for the solution, we are able to show that our proposed estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel bias mitigation framework with distribution-based fairness constraints suitable for producing demographically blind and explainable machine-learning models across a wide range of fairness levels. This is accomplished through post-processing, allowing fairer models to be generated efficiently without retraining the underlying model. Our framework, which is based on stochastic gradient descent, can be applied to a wide range of model types, with a particular emphasis on the post-processing of gradient-boosted decision trees. Additionally, we design a broad family of global fairness metrics, along with differentiable and consistent estimators compatible with our framework, building on previous work. We empirically test our methodology on a variety of datasets and compare it with alternative post-processing approaches, including Bayesian search, optimal transport projection, and direct neural network training.</description>

      <title>A formula for the edge density $\sqrt{n}$-correction for two-dimensional Coulomb systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In connection with recent work on smallest gaps, C. Charlier proves that the 1-point function of a suitable planar Coulomb system $\{z_j\}_1^n$, in the determinantal case with respect to an external potential $Q(z)$, admits the expansion, as $n\to\infty$, $$R_n\bigg(z_0+\frac t {\sqrt{2n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}}\nu(z_0)\bigg)=n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)\frac {\operatorname{erfc} t}2+\sqrt{n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}\,C(z_0;t)+\mathcal{O}(\log^3 n).$$ Here $t$ is a real parameter, $z_0$ is a regular boundary point of the (connected) Coulomb droplet and $\nu(z_0)$ is the outwards unit normal; the coefficient $C(z_0;t)$ has an apriori structure depending on a number of parameters.
  In this note we identify the parameters and obtain a formula for $C(z_0;t)$ in potential theoretic and geometric terms. Our formula holds for a large class of potentials such that the droplet is connected with smooth boundary. Our derivation uses the well known expectation of fluctuations formula.</description>
