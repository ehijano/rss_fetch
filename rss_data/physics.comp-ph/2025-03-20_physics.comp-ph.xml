      <title>Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory for Periodic Solids: Construction of the Pauli Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical success of density functional theory (DFT) is largely credited to the Kohn-Sham approach, which enables the exact calculation of the non-interacting electron kinetic energy via an auxiliary noninteracting system. Yet, the realization of DFT's full potential awaits the discovery of a direct link between the electron density, $n$, and the non-interacting kinetic energy, $T_{S}[n]$. In this work, we address two key challenges towards this objective. First, we introduce a new algorithm for directly solving the constrained minimization problem yielding $T_{S}[n]$ for periodic densities -- a class of densities that, in spite of its central importance for materials science, has received limited attention in the literature. Second, we present a numerical procedure that allows us to calculate the functional derivative of $T_{S}[n]$ with respect to the density at constant electron number, also known as the Kohn-Sham potential $V_{S}[n](\rv)$. Lastly, the algorithm is augmented with a subroutine that computes the ``derivative discontinuity", i.e., the spatially uniform jump in $V_{S}[n](\rv)$ which occurs upon increasing or decreasing the total number of electrons. This feature allows us to distinguish between ``insulating" and ``conducting" densities for non interacting electrons. The code integrates key methodological innovations, such as the use of an adaptive basis set (``equidensity orbitals") for wave function expansion and the QR decomposition to accelerate the implementation of the orthogonality constraint. Notably, we derive a closed-form expression for the Pauli potential in one dimension, expressed solely in terms of the input density, without relying on Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We validate this method on one-dimensional periodic densities, achieving results within ``chemical accuracy".</description>

      <title>Scattering graph method for 3D radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modelling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Magnetic skyrmions embedded in a vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic vortices and skyrmions represent two fundamental classes of topological spin textures in ferromagnetic systems, distinguished by their unique stabilization mechanisms and degrees of freedom. Vortices, characterized by circular in-plane magnetization (chirality) and out-of-plane core polarization, naturally arise in confined geometries due to the interplay between exchange and dipolar interactions. In contrast, skyrmions typically require the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for stabilization and exhibit fixed chirality-polarity relationships. Through micromagnetic simulations, we reveal that these seemingly distinct topological states can coexist, forming a novel composite state termed the \textit{n}-skyrmion vortex, which represents a skyrmion-embedded vortex state. These composite states possess quantized topological charges $Q$ that follow the relation $Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{vortex}} + nQ_{\text{skyrmion}}$, where $n$ denotes the number of embedded skyrmions. Similar to vortices, these states exhibit independent chirality and polarity and are energetically degenerate.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Deep quantum Monte Carlo approach for polaritonic chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schr\"odinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Discovery of Anti-gap Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional semiconductors typically have bonding states near the valence band maximum (VBM) and antibonding states near the conduction band minimum (CBM). Semiconductors with the opposite electronic configuration, namely an antibonding VBM and a bonding CBM, are here termed ``anti-gap semiconductors". They have been theoretically proposed to exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties because of their strong tolerance to defects. However, no anti-gap semiconductors have been identified so far, despite a known list of semiconductors with an antibonding VBM. Here, we use high-throughput computation to identify over 100 anti-gap semiconductors. From this group, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenide MX$_2$ (M=Hf, Zr; X=S, Se) family in detail. In addition to verifying their defect tolerance for both electrons and holes using first-principles simulations, we also discovered that photoexcitation of charge carriers can lead to significant lattice stiffening and increased thermal conductivity in anti-gap semiconductors, which can be potentially used as photo-driven thermal switches. Our work analyzes the formation of the anti-gap electronic structure and showcases their unusual photoinduced lattice dynamics that can have a potential impact on their photophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of structural disorder on magnetic properties and electronic structure of YCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the changes of magnetic properties with increasing disorder in the exchange enhanced Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$ are discussed. The structural disorder is initially introduced by rapid quenching, while further changes on micro-/nanoscale are caused by a high pressure torsion (HPT). Values of the magnetic moment determined for the plastically deformed ribbons reach 0.10 $\mu_B$/Co atom (for a sample subjected to the deformation at a pressure of 4 GPa) and 0.25 $\mu_B$/Co (6 GPa) at 2 K. Magnetic moment arise not only from the surface of nanocrystals but also from volume. Ab initio calculations explained the influence of chemical disorder and different types of structural defects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of YCo2-based Laves phases. The calculated magnetic ground states are in qualitative agreement with experimental results for all considered structures with point defects.</description>

      <title>Normal and inverse magnetocaloric effects in structurally disordered Laves phase Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1) compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ compounds, where x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems: The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently developed the \textit{constraint} coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$. It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CLINE (Computational Learning and Identification of Nullclines), a neural network-based method that uncovers the hidden structure of nullclines from oscillatory time series data. Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operator based surrogates for $CO_2$ storage in realistic geologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and fluctuations in mesoscopic stochastic simulations of reactive gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is essential that mesoscopic simulations of reactive systems reproduce the correct statistical distributions at thermodynamic equilibrium. By considering a compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) simulation method of ideal gas mixtures undergoing reversible reactions described by the chemical Langevin equations, we show that thermodynamic consistency in reaction rates and the use of instantaneous temperatures for the evaluation of reaction rates is required for fluctuations for the overall system to be correct. We then formulate the required properties of a thermodynamically-consistent reaction (TCR) model. As noted in the literature, while reactions are often discussed in terms of forward and reverse rates, these rates should not be modeled independently because they must be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Using a simple TCR model where each chemical species has constant heat capacity, we derive the explicit condition that the forward and reverse reaction rate constants must satisfy in order for the system to be thermodynamically consistent. We perform equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of ideal gas mixtures undergoing a reversible dimerization reaction to measure the fluctuational behavior of the system numerically. We confirm that FHD simulations with the TCR model give the correct static structure factor of equilibrium fluctuations. For the statistically steady simulation of a gas mixture between two isothermal walls with different temperatures, we show using the TCR model that the temperature variance agrees with the corresponding thermodynamic-equilibrium temperature variance in the interior of the system, whereas noticeable deviations are present in regions near walls, where chemistry is far from equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>How accurate is mechanobiology? A statistical test of cell force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanobiology is gaining more and more traction as the fundamental role of physical forces in biological function becomes clearer. Forces at the microscale are often measured indirectly using inverse problems such as Traction Force Microscopy because biological experiments are hard to access with physical probes. In contrast with the experimental nature of biology and physics, these measurements do not come with error bars, confidence regions, or p-values. The aim of this manuscript is to publicize this issue and to propose a first step towards a remedy therefor in the form of a general reconstruction framework. We also show that this opens the door to hypothesis testing of seemingly abstract experimental questions.</description>

      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the Application of Fractional Operators in Polynomial Regression Models to Enhance the Determination Coefficient $R^2$ on Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since polynomial regression models are generally quite reliable for data with a linear trend, it is important to note that, in some cases, they may encounter overfitting issues during the training phase, which could result in negative values of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ for unseen data. For this reason, this work proposes the partial implementation of fractional operators in polynomial regression models to generate a fractional regression model. The goal of this proposal is to attempt to mitigate overfitting, which could improve the value of the coefficient of determination for unseen data, compared to the polynomial model, under the assumption that this would contribute to generating predictive models with better performance. The methodology for constructing these fractional regression models is detailed, and examples applicable to both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional operators are presented.</description>

      <title>Symplectic integration of guiding-center equations in canonical coordinates for general toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</description>
