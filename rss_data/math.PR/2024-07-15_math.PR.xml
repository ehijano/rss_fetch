      <title>Weak well-posedness of energy solutions to singular SDEs with supercritical distributional drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic differential equations with additive noise and distributional drift on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $d \geqslant 2$. We work in a scaling-supercritical regime using energy solutions and recent ideas for generators of singular stochastic partial differential equations. We mainly focus on divergence-free drift, but allow for scaling-critical non-divergence free perturbations. In the time-dependent divergence-free case we roughly speaking prove weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial law $\mu \ll \text{Leb}$ for drift $b \in L^p_T B^{-\gamma}_{p, 1}$ with $p \in (2, \infty]$ and $p \geqslant \frac{2}{1 -\gamma}$. For time-independent $b$ we show weak well-posedness of energy solutions with initial law $\mu \ll \text{Leb}$ under certain structural assumptions on $b$ which allow local singularities such that $b \notin B^{-1}_{2 d/(d-2), 2}$, meaning that for any $p &gt; 2$ in sufficiently high dimension there exists $b \notin B^{-1}_{p, 2}$ such that weak well-posedness holds for energy solutions with drift $b$.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence for tensor GUE random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen proved that iid GUEs converge strongly to free semicircular elements as the dimension grows to infinity. Motivated by considerations from quantum physics -- in particular, understanding nearest neighbor interactions in quantum spin systems -- we consider iid GUE acting on multipartite state spaces, with a mixing component on some sites and identity on the remaining sites. We show that under proper assumptions on the dimension of the sites, strong asymptotic freeness still holds. Our proof relies on an interpolation technology recently introduced by Bandeira, Boedihardjo and van Handel.</description>

      <title>Multiple collisions of eigenvalues and singular values of matrix Gaussian field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X^\beta$ be a real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrix whose entries are independent Gaussian random fields. We provide the sufficient and necessary conditions such that multiple collisions of eigenvalue processes of $A^\beta + T_\beta X^\beta T_\beta^*$ occur with positive probability. In addition, for a real or complex rectangular matrix $W^\beta$ with independent Gaussian random field entries, we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under which the probability of multiple collisions of non-trivial singular value processes of $B^\beta + T_\beta W^\beta \tilde T_\beta$ is positive. In both cases, the size of the set of collision times is characterized via Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>The CFT of SLE loop measures and the Kontsevich--Suhov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>

      <title>Quantitative diffusion approximation for the Neutral $r$-Alleles Wright-Fisher Model with Mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a Lindeberg principle under the Markov process setting to approximate the Wright-Fisher model with neutral $r$-alleles using a diffusion process, deriving an error rate based on a function class distance involving fourth-order bounded differentiable functions. This error rate consists of a linear combination of the maximum mutation rate and the reciprocal of the population size. Our result improves the error bound in the seminal work [PNAS,1977], where only the special case $r=2$ was studied.</description>

      <title>A short memory condition for infinitely divisible random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This small note yields a sufficient condition for the short range dependence of measurable stationary infinitely divisible moving average random fields with $d$--dimensional index space. Here, the short/long range dependence concept in borrowed from the paper of Kulik and Spodarev (2021). In the special case of symmetric stable moving averages, our new condition coincides with the one from the paper of Makogin et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Energy solutions to SDEs with supercritical distributional drift: A stopping argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider the SDE \begin{equation*}
  \text{d}X_t = b (t, X_t) \text{d} t + \sqrt{2} \text{d} B_t, \label{mainSDE} \end{equation*} in dimension $d \geqslant 2$, where $B$ is a Brownian motion and $b : \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathcal{S}' (\mathbb{R}^d ; \mathbb{R}^d)$ is distributional, scaling super-critical and satisfies $\nabla \cdot b \equiv 0$. We partially extend the super-critical weak well-posedness result for energy solutions from [GP24] by allowing a mixture of the regularity regimes treated therein: Outside of environments of a small (and compared to [GP24] ''time-dependent'') set $K \subset \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}^d$, the antisymmetric matrix field $A$ with $b^i = \nabla\cdot A_i$ is assumed to be in a certain supercritical $L^q_T H^{s, p}$-type class that allows a direct link between the PDE and the SDE from a-priori estimates up to the stopping time of visiting $K$. To establish this correspondence, and thus uniqueness, globally in time we then show that $K$ is actually never visited which requires us to impose a relation between the dimension of $K$ and the H\"older regularity of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two-sided estimates of a ground state for Schr\"odinger operators with confining potentials. We propose a semigroup approach, based on resolvent and the Feynman--Kac formula, which leads to a new, rather short and direct proof. Our results take the sharpest form for slowly varying, radial and increasing potentials.</description>

      <title>Convergence in total variation for the kinetic Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <title>A note on Skew Brownian Motion with two-valued drift and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For skew Brownian motion with two-valued drift, adopting a perturbation approach we find expressions of its potential densities. As applications, we recover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. We also compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian motions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by approximating the cumulative distribution function and discussing their risk measurement application.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure to construct a natural representation of the Virasoro algebra of central charge $c = c(\kappa) \le 1$. In particular, we introduce a non-degenerate bilinear Hermitian form (not positive-definite) using the SLE loop measure and show that the representation is (indefinite) unitary. Our proof relies on the infinitesimal conformal restriction property of the SLE loop measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate a basic strategy for several variations of a simplified version of Blackjack. In short, for these variants the player has only the two options of hit or stand, and they may only make either decision once. Other minor variations including rule modifications, changes in number of decks, alternate payout structures, and different given information about dealer's hand are also considered. An interesting theoretical result regarding the asymptotic behavior of the basic strategy and overall expectation as the number of decks increase is also proved.</description>

      <title>Examples and Counterexamples of Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a number of examples and counterexamples to illustrate the results on cost-efficiency in an incomplete market obtained in [BS24]. These examples and counterexamples do not only illustrate the results obtained in [BS24], but show the limitations of the results and the sharpness of the key assumptions. In particular, we make use of a simple 3-state model in which we are able to recover and illustrate all key results of the paper. This example also shows how our characterization of perfectly cost-efficient claims allows to solve an expected utility maximization problem in a simple incomplete market (trinomial model) and recover results from [DS06, Chapter 3], there obtained using duality.</description>

      <title>Approximating G(t)/GI/1 queues with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a supervised machine-learning approach to solve a fundamental problem in queueing theory: estimating the transient distribution of the number in the system for a G(t)/GI/1. We develop a neural network mechanism that provides a fast and accurate predictor of these distributions for moderate horizon lengths and practical settings. It is based on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture based on the first several moments of the time-dependant inter-arrival and the stationary service time distributions; we call it the Moment-Based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method (MBRNN ). Our empirical study suggests MBRNN requires only the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We use simulation to generate a substantial training dataset and present a thorough performance evaluation to examine the accuracy of our method using two different test sets. We show that even under the configuration with the worst performance errors, the mean number of customers over the entire timeline has an error of less than 3%. While simulation modeling can achieve high accuracy, the advantage of the MBRNN over simulation is runtime, while the MBRNN analyzes hundreds of systems within a fraction of a second. This paper focuses on a G(t)/GI/1; however, the MBRNN approach demonstrated here can be extended to other queueing systems, as the training data labeling is based on simulations (which can be applied to more complex systems) and the training is based on deep learning, which can capture very complex time sequence tasks. In summary, the MBRNN can potentially revolutionize our ability to perform transient analyses of queueing systems.</description>

      <title>The saddlepoint approximation for averages of conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of saddlepoint approximations to resampling-based statistical tests, we prove that a Lugananni-Rice style approximation for conditional tail probabilities of averages of conditionally independent random variables has vanishing relative error. We also provide a general condition on the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the corresponding saddlepoint equation. The results are valid under a broad class of distributions involving no restrictions on the smoothness of the distribution function. The derived saddlepoint approximation formula can be directly applied to resampling-based hypothesis tests, including bootstrap, sign-flipping and conditional randomization tests. Our results extend and connect several classical saddlepoint approximation results. On the way to proving our main results, we prove a new conditional Berry-Esseen inequality for the sum of conditionally independent random variables, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of ergodic BSDEs using non linear Feynman-Kac formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the numerical approximation of a class of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. These equations are formulated in an infinite horizon framework and provide a probabilistic representation for elliptic Partial Differential Equations of ergodic type. In order to build our numerical scheme, we put forward a new representation of the PDE solution by using a classical probabilistic representation of the gradient. Then, based on this representation, we propose a fully implementable numerical scheme using a Picard iteration procedure, a grid space discretization and a Monte-Carlo approximation. Up to a limiting technical condition that guarantee the contraction of the Picard procedure, we obtain an upper bound for the numerical error. We also provide some numerical experiments that show the efficiency of this approach for small dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study H\"older continuity, $p^\mathrm{th}$-variation function and Riesz variation of Weierstrass-type functions along a sequence of $b$-adic partitions, where $b&gt;1$ is an integer. By a Weierstrass-type function, we mean that in the definition of the well-known Weierstrass function, the power function is replaced by a submultiplicative function, and the Lipschitz continuous cosine and sine functions are replaced by a general H\"older continuous function. Our results extend some of the recent results of Schied and Zhang (2020, 2024).</description>

Abstract: The moderate deviation principle is achieved for a stochastic Schrodinger type equation by applying the classical Azencott method. The Friedlin-Wentzell inequality derived by this method is then used to prove the Strassen's compact law of the iterated logarithm for the equation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the almost everywhere convergence of sequences of convolution operators given by probability measures $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb R$. If this sequence of operators constitutes an approximate identity on a particular class of functions $\mathcal F$, under what additional conditions do we have $\mu_n \ast f \to f$ a.e. for all $f \in \mathcal F$? We focus on the particular case of a sequence of contractions $C_{t_n}\mu$ of a single probability measure $\mu$, with $t_n \to 0$, so that that the sequence of operators is an approximate identity.</description>

      <title>A new approach to principal-agent problems with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent work by Cvitani\'c, Possama\"i, and Touzi (2018) [9] presents a general approach for continuous-time principal-agent problems, through dynamic programming and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the principal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of BSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9], namely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time, she can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this information is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming that the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best' fashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows the line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on continuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov (2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is identical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the contract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that this `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot directly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely on the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their optimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We believe that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time principal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the dissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even more intricate problems.</description>

      <title>Information-Based Approach: Pricing of a Credit Risky Asset in the Presence of Default Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the information-based asset-pricing framework by Brody, Hughston \&amp; Macrina to incorporate a stochastic bankruptcy time for the writer of the asset. Our model introduces a non-defaultable cash flow $Z_T$ to be made at time $T$, alongside the time $\tau$ of a possible bankruptcy of the writer of the asset are in line with the filtration generated by a Brownian random bridge with length $\nu=\tau \wedge T$ and pinning point $\sigma Z_T$, where $\sigma$ is a constant. Quantities $Z_T$ and $\tau$ are not necessarily independent. The model does not depend crucially on the interpretation of $\tau$ as a bankruptcy time. We derived the price process of the asset and compute the prices of associated options. The dynamics of the price process satisfy a diffusion equation. Employing the approach of P.-A.~ Meyer, we provide the explicit computation of the compensator of $\nu$. Leveraging special properties of the bridge process, we also provide the explicit expression of the compensator of $Z_T\,\mathbb{I}_{[\nu,+\infty)}$. The resulting conclusion highlights the totally inaccessible property of the stopping time $\nu$. This characteristic is particularly suitable for financial markets where the time of default of a writer cannot be predictable from any other signal in the system until default happens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct a representation of the Virasoro algebra in the canonical Hilbert space associated to Liouville conformal field theory. The study of the Virasoro operators is performed through the introduction of a new family of Markovian dynamics associated to holomorphic vector fields defined in the disk. As an output, we show that the Hamiltonian of Liouville conformal field theory can be diagonalized through the action of the Virasoro algebra. This enables to show that the scattering matrix of the theory is diagonal and that the family of the so-called primary fields (which are eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian) admits an analytic extension to the whole complex plane, as conjectured in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>The Critical Density for Activated Random Walks is always less than 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activated Random Walks, on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for any $d\geqslant 1$, is an interacting particle system, where particles can be in either of two states: active or frozen. Each active particle performs a continuous-time simple random walk during an exponential time of parameter $\lambda$, after which it stays still in the frozen state, until another active particle shares its location, and turns it instantaneously back into activity. This model is known to have a phase transition, and we show that the critical density, controlling the phase transition, is less than one in any dimension and for any value of the sleep rate $\lambda$. We provide upper bounds for the critical density in both the small $\lambda$ and large $\lambda$ regimes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics for the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a natural class of nonlinear dynamics for spin systems such as the Ising model. This class of dynamics is based on the framework of mass action kinetics, which models the evolution of systems of entities under pairwise interactions, and captures a number of important nonlinear models from various fields, including chemical reaction networks, Boltzmann's model of an ideal gas, recombination in population genetics and genetic algorithms. In the context of spin systems, it is a natural generalization of linear dynamics based on Markov chains, such as Glauber dynamics and block dynamics, which are by now well understood. However, the inherent nonlinearity makes the dynamics much harder to analyze, and rigorous quantitative results so far are limited to processes which converge to essentially trivial stationary distributions that are product measures. In this paper we provide the first quantitative convergence analysis for natural nonlinear dynamics in a combinatorial setting where the stationary distribution contains non-trivial correlations, namely the Ising model at high temperatures. We prove that nonlinear versions of both the Glauber dynamics and the block dynamics converge to the Gibbs distribution of the Ising model (with given external fields) in times $O(n\log n)$ and $O(\log n)$ respectively, where $n$ is the size of the underlying graph (number of spins). Given the lack of general analytical methods for such nonlinear systems, our analysis is unconventional, and combines tools such as information percolation (due in the linear setting to Lubetzky and Sly), a novel coupling of the Ising model with Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, and non-traditional branching processes augmented by a fragmentation process.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations and Metastability Analysis for Heavy-Tailed Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that connects large deviations and metastability analysis in heavy-tailed stochastic dynamical systems. Employing this framework in the context of stochastic difference equations $X^\eta_{j+1}(x) = X^\eta_{j}(x) + \eta a\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big) + \eta \sigma\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big)Z_{j+1}$ and its variations with truncated dynamics, we first establish locally uniform sample path large deviations and then translate such asymptotics into a precise characterization of the joint distribution of the first exit time and exit location. As a result, we obtain the heavy-tailed counterparts of the classical Freidlin-Wentzell and Eyring-Kramers theorems. Our large deviations asymptotics are sharp enough to identify how rare events arise in heavy-tailed dynamical systems and characterize the catastrophe principle. Moreover, it also unveils the discrete hierarchy of phase transitions in the asymptotics of the first exit times and locations under truncated heavy-tailed noises. Our results in this paper open up the possibility of systematic analysis of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed stochastic processes. In the appendix, we also present the corresponding results for the L\'evy driven SDEs.</description>

      <title>Strong survival and extinction for branching random walks via a new order for generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general discrete-time branching random walks on a countable set $X$. According to these processes, a particle at $x\in X$ generates a random number of children and places them at (some of) the sites of $X$, not necessarily independently nor with the same law at different starting vertices $x$.We introduce a new type of stochastic ordering of branching random walks, generalizing the germ order introduced by Hutchcroft in arXiv:2011.06402, which relies on the generating function of the process. We prove that given two branching random walks with law $\mathbf{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\nu}$ respectively, with $\mathbf{\mu} \ge \mathbf{\nu}$, then in every set where there is extinction according to $\mathbf{\mu}$, there is extinction also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$. Moreover, in every set where there is strong local survival according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, there is strong local survival also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, provided that the supremum of the global extinction probabilities, for the $\mathbf{\nu}$-process, taken over all starting points $x$, is strictly smaller than 1. New conditions for survival and strong survival for inhomogeneous branching random walks are provided. We also extend a result of Moyal which claims that, under some conditions, the global extinction probability for a branching random walk is the only fixed point of its generating function, whose supremum over all starting coordinates, may be equal to 1.</description>

      <title>Branching Brownian motion versus Random Energy Model in the supercritical phase: overlap distribution and temperature susceptibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <title>One-arm Probabilities for Metric Graph Gaussian Free Fields below and at the Critical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the critical level-set of the Gaussian free field on the metric graph of $\mathbb Z^d$, we consider the one-arm probability $\theta_d(N)$, i.e., the probability that the boundary of a box of side length $2N$ is connected to the center. We prove that $\theta_d(N)$ is $O(N^{-\frac{d}{2}+1})$ for $3\le d\le 5$, and is $N^{-2+o(1)}$ for $d=6$. Our upper bounds match the lower bounds in a previous work by Ding and Wirth up to a constant factor for $3\le d\le 5$, and match the exponent therein for $d=6$. Combined with our previous result that $\theta_d(N) \asymp N^{-2}$ for $d&gt;6$, this seems to present the first percolation model whose one-arm probabilities are essentially completely understood in all dimensions. In particular, these results fully confirm Werner's conjectures (2021) on the one-arm exponents:
  \begin{equation*}
  \text{(1) for}\ 3\le d&lt;d_c=6,\ \theta_d(N)=N^{-\frac{d}{2}+o(1)};\ \text{(2) for}\ d&gt;d_c,\ \theta_d(N)=N^{-2+o(1)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Prior to our work, Drewitz, Pr\'evost and Rodriguez obtained upper bounds for $d\in \{3, 4\}$, which are very sharp although lose some diverging factors. In the same work, they conjectured that $\theta_{d_c}(N) = N^{-2+o(1)}$, which is now established. In addition, in a recent concurrent work, Drewitz, Pr\'evost and Rodriguez independently obtained the up-to-constant upper bound for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair $(\tau,\tau')$ of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$. We confirm the presence of a partial antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. In this phase, $\tau$ is disordered, admitting exponential decay of correlations, while the product $\tau\tau'$ is antiferromagnetically ordered, which is to say that correlations are bounded away from zero but alternate in sign. No correlation inequalities are available in this part of the phase diagram. In the planar case $d=2$, we construct a coupling with the six-vertex model and show, in analogy to the first result, that the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of the graph.
  We then return to $d\geq 2$ and consider a part of the phase diagram where $U&lt;0$ but where correlation inequalities still apply. Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves covering this part, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates first the existence and uniqueness of solutions for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations (MV-FBDSDEs) in infinite-dimensional real separable Hilbert spaces. These equations combine the features of forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations with the mean-field approach, allowing the coefficients to depend on the solution distribution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for MV-FBDSDEs using the method of continuation and provide an example and a counterexample to illustrate our findings. Moreover, we extend the practical applicability of our results by employing them within the context of the stochastic maximum principle for a control problem governed by MV-FBDSDEs. This study contributes to the field of stochastic control problems and presents the first analysis of MV-FBDSDEs in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish two fundamental results for the sublevel set persistent homology for stationary processes indexed by the positive integers. The first is a strong law of large numbers for the persistence diagram (treated as a measure "above the diagonal" in the extended plane) evaluated on a large class of sets and functions$\unicode{x2014}$more than just continuous functions with compact support. We prove this result subject to only minor conditions that the sequence is ergodic and the tails of the marginals are not too heavy. The second result is a central limit theorem for the persistence diagram evaluated on the class of all step functions; this result holds as long as a $\rho$-mixing criterion is satisfied and the distributions of the partial maxima do not decay too slowly. Our results greatly expand those extant in the literature to allow for more fruitful use in statistical applications, beyond idealized settings. Examples of distributions and functions for which the limit theory holds are provided throughout.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local in time spatially real-analytic solution to the 2D and 3D stochastic Navier--Stokes equation driven by a spatially real-analytic multiplicative and transport noise but emanating from an initial condition that is only required to have bounded enstrophy. Under the condition that the solution is global in time, we also establish the exponential decay of the finite-dimensional Galerkin approximation, with respect to its maximum wavenumber, to the strong pathwise solution of the stochastic Navier--Stokes equation. This decay is uniform in time, uniform with respect to the initial enstropy, and uniform in the noise coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications across all fields of science and engineering and beyond. The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant pertaining to the parametrized distributions used to model the data. In this paper, we present a novel Stein operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizers namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Proof of several properties of MKSDE are presented, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher distribution on SO(N). Finally, we present experimental evidence depicting advantages of minimizing KSD over maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>Schur function expansion in non-Hermitian ensembles and averages of characteristic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $k$-point correlators of characteristic polynomials in non-Hermitian ensembles of random matrices, focusing on the real, complex and quaternion $N \times N$ Ginibre ensembles. Our approach is based on the technique of character expansions, which expresses the correlator as a sum over partitions involving Schur functions. We show how to re-sum the expansions in terms of representations which interchange the roles of $N$ and $k$. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the character expansion analogous to the Schur measure, linking the correlators to the distribution of the top row in certain Young diagrams. In more specific examples we evaluate these expressions explicitly in terms of $k \times k$ determinants or Pfaffians. We show that our approach extends to other ensembles, such as truncations of random unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Stopper vs. singular-controller games with degenerate diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study zero-sum stochastic games between a singular controller and a stopper when the (state-dependent) diffusion matrix of the underlying controlled diffusion process is degenerate. In particular, we show the existence of a value for the game and determine an optimal strategy for the stopper. The degeneracy of the dynamics prevents the use of analytical methods based on solution in Sobolev spaces of suitable variational problems. Therefore we adopt a probabilistic approach based on a perturbation of the underlying diffusion modulated by a parameter $\gamma&gt;0$. For each $\gamma&gt;0$ the approximating game is non-degenerate and admits a value $u^\gamma$ and an optimal strategy $\tau^\gamma_*$ for the stopper. Letting $\gamma\to 0$ we prove convergence of $u^\gamma$ to a function $v$, which identifies the value of the original game. We also construct explicitly optimal stopping times $\theta^\gamma_*$ for $u^\gamma$, related but not equal to $\tau^\gamma_*$, which converge almost surely to an optimal stopping time $\theta_*$ for the game with degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence of \v{C}ech persistence diagrams for samplings of submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \v{C}ech Persistence diagrams (PDs) are topological descriptors routinely used to capture the geometry of complex datasets. They are commonly compared using the Wasserstein distances $OT_{p}$; however, the extent to which PDs are stable with respect to these metrics remains poorly understood. We partially close this gap by focusing on the case where datasets are sampled on an $m$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under this manifold hypothesis, we show that convergence with respect to the $OT_{p}$ metric happens exactly when $p\gt m$. We also provide improvements upon the bottleneck stability theorem in this case and prove new laws of large numbers for the total $\alpha$-persistence of PDs. Finally, we show how these theoretical findings shed new light on the behavior of the feature maps on the space of PDs that are used in ML-oriented applications of Topological Data Analysis.</description>
