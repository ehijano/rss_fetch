      <title>Reassessing Relationality for Bipolar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for clustering people into construals--social affinity groups of individuals who share similarities in how they organize their outlooks on a collection of issues--have recently gained traction. Relational Class Analysis (RCA) is currently the most commonly used method for construal clustering. RCA has been applied to identify affinity groups in social spheres as varied as politics, musical preferences, and attitudes towards science. In this study, we highlight limitations in RCA's ability to accurately identify the number and underlying structure of construals. These limitations stem from RCA's mathematical underpinnings and its insensitivity to the bipolar structure of the survey items, which require respondents to place themselves in a support or rejection space and then express the intensity of their support or rejection. We develop an alternative method, which we call Bipolar Class Analysis (BCA), that aims to address this foundational limitation. BCA conceptualizes people's attitudinal positions as moving along support/rejection semispaces and assesses similarity in opinion organization by taking into account position switches across these semispaces. We conduct extensive simulation analyses, with data organized around different construals, to demonstrate that BCA clusters individuals more accurately than RCA and other available alternatives. We also replicate previous analyses to show that BCA leads to substantively different empirical results than those produced by RCA in its original and later versions, and by Correlational Clustering Analysis (CCA), a method that has been proposed as an alternative to RCA.</description>

      <title>CyNetDiff -- A Python Library for Accelerated Implementation of Network Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in network diffusion models and related problems. The most popular of these are the independent cascade and linear threshold models. Much of the recent experimental work done on these models requires a large number of simulations conducted on large graphs, a computationally expensive task suited for low-level languages. However, many researchers prefer the use of higher-level languages (such as Python) for their flexibility and shorter development times. Moreover, in many research tasks, these simulations are the most computationally intensive task, so it would be desirable to have a library for these with an interface to a high-level language with the performance of a low-level language. To fill this niche, we introduce CyNetDiff, a Python library with components written in Cython to provide improved performance for these computationally intensive diffusion tasks.</description>

      <title>Rumour Evaluation with Very Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) have enabled targeted control over the output creation, enhancing versatility, adaptability and adhoc retrieval. From another perspective, digital misinformation has reached alarming levels. The anonymity, availability and reach of social media offer fertile ground for rumours to propagate. This work proposes to leverage the advancement of prompting-dependent LLMs to combat misinformation by extending the research efforts of the RumourEval task on its Twitter dataset. To the end, we employ two prompting-based LLM variants (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4) to extend the two RumourEval subtasks: (1) veracity prediction, and (2) stance classification. For veracity prediction, three classifications schemes are experimented per GPT variant. Each scheme is tested in zero-, one- and few-shot settings. Our best results outperform the precedent ones by a substantial margin. For stance classification, prompting-based-approaches show comparable performance to prior results, with no improvement over finetuning methods. Rumour stance subtask is also extended beyond the original setting to allow multiclass classification. All of the generated predictions for both subtasks are equipped with confidence scores determining their trustworthiness degree according to the LLM, and post-hoc justifications for explainability and interpretability purposes. Our primary aim is AI for social good.</description>

      <title>Edge Importance in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are made up of vertices and edges. The latter connect the vertices. There are several ways to measure the importance of the vertices, e.g., by counting the number of edges that start or end at each vertex, or by using the subgraph centrality of the vertices. It is more difficult to assess the importance of the edges. One approach is to consider the line graph associated with the given network and determine the importance of the vertices of the line graph, but this is fairly complicated except for small networks. This paper compares two approaches to estimate the importance of edges of medium-sized to large networks. One approach computes partial derivatives of the total communicability of the weights of the edges, where a partial derivative of large magnitude indicates that the corresponding edge may be important. Our second approach computes the Perron sensitivity of the edges. A high sensitivity signals that the edge may be important. The performance of these methods and some computational aspects are discussed. Applications of interest include to determine whether a network can be replaced by a network with fewer edges with about the same communicability.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>

      <title>Simple Network Mechanism Leads to Quasi-Real Brain Activation Patterns with Drosophila Connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the high computational demands of most methods, using network communication models to simulate the brain is a more economical way. However, despite numerous brain network communication models, there is still insufficient evidence that they can effectively replicate the real activation patterns of the brain. Moreover, it remains unclear whether actual network structures are crucial in simulating intelligence. Addressing these issues, we propose a large scale network communication model based on simple rules and design criteria to assess the differences between network models and real situations. We conduct research on the biggest adult Drosophila connectome data set. Experimental results show significant activation in neurons that should respond to stimulus and slight activation in irrelevant ones, which we call quasi-real activation pattern. Besides, when we change the network structure, the quasi-activation patterns disappear. Interestingly, activation regions have shorter network distances to their input neurons, implying that the network structure (not spatial distance) is the core to form brain functionality. In addition, giving the input neurons a unilateral stimulus, we observe a bilateral response, which is consistent with reality. Then we find that both hemispheres have extremely similar statistical indicators. We also develop real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software to observe and document experimental phenomena, filling the software gap. This research reveals network models' power: it can reach the quasi-activation pattern even with simple propagation rules. Besides, it provides evidence that network structure matters in brain activity pattern generation. Future research could fully simulate brain behavior through network models, paving the way for artificial intelligence by developing new propagation rules and optimizing link weights.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Fairness Divide: Achieving Group and Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and learning from complex data structured as graphs, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and drug discovery. However, despite their impressive performance, the fairness problem has increasingly gained attention as a crucial aspect to consider. Existing research in graph learning focuses on either group fairness or individual fairness. However, since each concept provides unique insights into fairness from distinct perspectives, integrating them into a fair graph neural network system is crucial. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet to comprehensively tackle both individual and group fairness simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new concept of individual fairness within groups and a novel framework named Fairness for Group and Individual (FairGI), which considers both group fairness and individual fairness within groups in the context of graph learning. FairGI employs the similarity matrix of individuals to achieve individual fairness within groups, while leveraging adversarial learning to address group fairness in terms of both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of group fairness and individual fairness within groups, but also exhibits excellent performance in population-level individual fairness, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Ideologies and Shared News During the 2019 Argentinian Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extensive data generated on social media platforms allow us to gain insights over trending topics and public opinions. Additionally, it offers a window into user behavior, including their content engagement and news sharing habits. In this study, we analyze the relationship between users' political ideologies and the news they share during Argentina's 2019 election period. Our findings reveal that users predominantly share news that aligns with their political beliefs, despite accessing media outlets with diverse political leanings. Moreover, we observe a consistent pattern of users sharing articles related to topics biased to their preferred candidates, highlighting a deeper level of political alignment in online discussions. We believe that this systematic analysis framework can be applied to similar scenarios in different countries, especially those marked by significant political polarization, akin to Argentina.</description>

      <title>Predicting Properties of Nodes via Community-Aware Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows how information about the network's community structure can be used to define node features with high predictive power for classification tasks. To do so, we define a family of community-aware node features and investigate their properties. Those features are designed to ensure that they can be efficiently computed even for large graphs. We show that community-aware node features contain information that cannot be completely recovered by classical node features or node embeddings (both classical and structural) and bring value in node classification tasks. This is verified for various classification tasks on synthetic and real-life networks.</description>

      <title>Attraction by pairwise coherence explains the emergence of ideological sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Political polarization has become a growing concern in democratic societies, as it drives tribal alignments and erodes civic deliberation among citizens. Given its prevalence across different countries, previous research has sought to understand the conditions under which people tend to endorse extreme opinions. However, in polarized contexts, citizens not only adopt more extreme views but also become correlated across issues which are, a priori, seemingly unrelated. This phenomenon, known as 'ideological sorting', has been receiving greater attention in recent years but the micro-level mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we study the conditions under which a social dynamic system is expected to become ideologically sorted as a function of the mechanisms of interaction between its individuals. To this end, we developed and analyzed a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two mechanisms: homophily (where people tend to interact with those holding similar opinions) and pairwise-coherence favoritism (where people tend to interact with ingroups holding politically coherent opinions). We numerically integrated the model's master equations that perfectly describe the system's dynamics and found that ideological sorting only emerges in models that include pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model's outcomes with empirical data proceeding from 24,035 opinions across 67 topics, and found that pairwise-coherence favoritism is significantly present in datasets that measure political attitudes, but absent across topics not considered related to politics. Overall, this work combines theoretical approaches from system dynamics with model-based analyses of empirical data to uncover a potential mechanism underlying the pervasiveness of ideological sorting.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>
