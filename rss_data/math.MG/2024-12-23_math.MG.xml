      <title>Characterization of metric spaces with a metric fundamental class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three conditions on metric manifolds with finite volume: (1) the existence of a metric fundamental class, (2) local index bounds for Lipschitz maps, and (3) Gromov--Hausdorff approximation with volume control by bi-Lipschitz manifolds. Condition (1) is known for metric manifolds satisfying the LLC condition by work of Basso--Marti--Wenger, while (3) is known for metric surfaces by work of Ntalampekos--Romney.
  We prove that for metric manifolds with finite Nagata dimension, all three conditions are equivalent and that without assuming finite Nagata dimension, (1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1). As a corollary we obtain a generalization of the approximation result of Ntalampekos--Romney to metric manifolds of dimension $n\ge 2$, which have the LLC property and finite Nagata dimension.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and physical billiard in pyramids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this experimental work we study billiard trajectories in triangular pyramids and try to establish conditions that guarantee the existence (or absence) of 4-cycles (there can be not more, than three of them). We formulate conjectures and prove some statements. For example, if a pyramid has two orthogonal faces, then it has not more than two 4-cycles. Also we study 4-cycles of the "physical" billiard in pyramids, i.e. in the presence of gravity. Here we present our observations for a generic case.</description>

      <title>Quantitative delocalisation for the Gaussian and $q$-SOS long-range chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to study quantitatively the localisation/delocalisation properties of the discrete Gaussian chain with long-range interactions. Specifically, we consider the discrete Gaussian chain of length $N$, with Dirichlet boundary condition, range exponent $\alpha \in (1 , \infty)$ and inverse temperature $\beta \in (0,\infty)$, and show that:
  - For $\alpha \in (2 ,3)$ and $\beta \in (0 , \infty)$, the fluctuations of the chain are at least of order $N^{\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - 2)}$;
  - For $\alpha = 3$ and $\beta \in (0 , \infty)$, the fluctuations of the chain are of order $\sqrt{N / \ln N}$ (sharp upper and lower bounds up to multiplicative constants are derived).
  Combined with the results of Kjaer-Hilhorst, Fr\"{o}hlich-Zegarlinski and Garban, these estimates provide an (almost) complete picture for the localisation/delocalisation of the discrete Gaussian chain. The proofs are based on graph surgery techniques which have been recently developed by van Engelenburg-Lis and Aizenman-Harel-Peled-Shapiro to study the phase transitions of two dimensional integer-valued height functions (and of their dual spin systems).
  Additionally, by combining the previous strategy with a technique introduced by Sellke, we are able extend the method to study the $q$-SOS long-range chain with exponent $q \in (0 , 2)$ and show that, for any inverse temperature $\beta\in (0, \infty)$ and any range exponent $\alpha \in (1 , \infty)$:
  - The fluctuations of the chain are at least of order $N^{\frac{1}{q}(\alpha -2) \wedge \frac{1}{2}}$;
  - The fluctuations of the chain are at most of order $N^{\left( \frac{1}{q}\alpha - 1 \right) \wedge \frac 12}$.</description>

      <title>Embedding relatively hyperbolic groups into products of binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ is relatively hyperbolic with respect to virtually abelian peripheral subgroups then $G$ quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. This extends the result of Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder in which they prove that a hyperbolic group quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. Inspired by Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder's Alice's Diary, we develop a general theory of diaries and linear statistics. These notions provide a framework by which one can take a quasiisometric embedding of a metric space into a product of infinite-valence trees and upgrade it to a quasiisometric embedding into a product of binary trees.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Volume of Random Projections and Sections of $\ell_p^N$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ be the $N$-dimensional unit ball corresponding to the $\ell_p$-norm. For each $N\in\mathbb N$ we sample a uniform random subspace $E_N$ of fixed dimension $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and consider the volume of $\mathbb{B}_p^N$ projected onto $E_N$ or intersected with $E_N$. We also consider geometric quantities other than the volume such as the intrinsic volumes or the dual volumes. In this setting we prove central limit theorems, moderate deviation principles, and large deviation principles as $N\to\infty$. Our results provide a complete asymptotic picture. In particular, they generalize and complement a result of Paouris, Pivovarov, and Zinn [A central limit theorem for projections of the cube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 159 (2014), 701-719] and another result of Adamczak, Pivovarov, and Simanjuntak [Limit theorems for the volumes of small codimensional random sections of $\ell_p^n$-balls, Ann. Probab. 52 (2024), 93-126].</description>

      <title>Each generic polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a point with ten normals to the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that each smooth convex body $\mathbf{P}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $\mathbf{P}$. The conjecture is proven for $n=2,3,4$. We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and prove that each generic polytope has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. This bound is exact: there exists a tetrahedron with no more than $10$ normals emanating from a point in its interior.</description>
