      <title>Order parameters in quasi-1D spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the idea of the meanfield. Meanfields approximately map - through some self consistency relation - a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problem (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems - which are solvable. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for both models.</description>

      <title>On the universal properties of stochastic processes under optimally tuned Poisson restart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson restart assumes that a stochastic process is interrupted and starts again at random time moments. A number of studies have demonstrated that this strategy may minimize the expected completion time in some classes of random search tasks. What is more, it turned out that under optimally tuned restart rate, any stochastic process, regardless of its nature and statistical details, satisfies a number of universal relations for the statistical moments of completion time. In this paper, we describe several new universal properties of optimally restarted processes. Also we obtain a universal inequality for the quadratic statistical moments of completion time in the optimization problem where stochastic process has several possible completion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of the onset of Floquet heating using eigenstate sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic Floquet systems at sufficiently low driving frequencies are known to heat up to an infinite temperature ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. However at high driving frequencies, Floquet systems remain energetically stable in a robust prethermal phase with exponentially long heating times. We propose sensitivity (susceptibility) of Floquet eigenstates against infinitesimal deformations of the drive, as a sharp and sensitive measure to detect this heating transition. It also captures various regimes (timescales) of Floquet thermalization accurately. Particularly, we find that at low frequencies near the onset of unbounded heating, Floquet eigenstates are maximally sensitive to perturbations and consequently the scaled susceptibility develops a sharp maximum. We further connect our results to the relaxation dynamics of local observables to show that near the onset of Floquet heating, the system is nonergodic with slow glassy dynamics despite being nonintegrable at all driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>Reweight-annealing method for calculating the value of partition function via quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Turbulence from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles approach to turbulence by employing the electrodynamics of continuous media at the viscous limit to recover the Navier-Stokes equations. We treat oscillators with two orthogonal angular momenta as a spin network with properties applicable to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. The microscopic viscous limit has an irreducible representation that includes $O(3)$ expansion terms for a radiation-dominated fluid with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, equivalent to an oriented toroidal de Sitter space. The turbulence solution in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ lies on 6-choose-3 de Sitter intersections of three orthogonal $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the AMOEBA force field for simulating metal halide perovskites in the solid state and in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to study the solid or solution phases of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth and other interfacial phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements in solution and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the missing ones (Pb\textsuperscript{2+} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{+} ions) in order to maximise transferability and avoid over-fitting to the specific examples studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of CsPbI\textsubscript{3} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}PbI\textsubscript{3}. While the existing parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid states than existing non-polarizable force fields.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike crystalline solids, liquids do not exhibit long-range order. Their atoms undergo frequent structural rearrangements, resulting in the long-wavelength dynamics of shear fluctuations in liquids being diffusive, rather than propagating waves, as observed in crystals. When considering shorter time and length scales, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical propositions suggest that collective shear excitations in liquids display a gap in wave-vector space, referred to as the $k$-gap. Above this gap, solid-like transverse waves re-emerge. However, direct experimental verification of this phenomenon in classical liquids remains elusive, with the only documented evidence from studies in two-dimensional dusty plasmas. Active granular systems provide a novel platform for exploring the emergence of collective dynamics and showcasing a rich interplay of complex phases and phenomena. Our study focuses on bi-disperse active Brownian vibrators. Through measurements of the pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, vibrational density of states, and a detailed analysis of microscopic atomic motion, we demonstrate that this active system exhibits both gas-like and liquid-like phases, depending on the packing fraction, despite pure hard-disk-like repulsive interactions. Notably, within the granular liquid-like phase, we experimentally validate the existence of a $k$-gap in the dispersion of transverse excitations. This gap becomes more significant with a decrease in packing fraction and disappears into the gas phase, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our results offer a direct experimental confirmation of the $k$-gap phenomenon, extending its relevance beyond classical thermal liquids to active granular systems, and reveal the existence of intriguing similarities between the physics of active granular matter and supercritical fluids.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in canonical ensemble with fixed total momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting homogeneous three-dimensional gas in canonical ensemble when both particle number $N$ and total momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of all particles are fixed. Using the saddle point method, we derive the large-$N$ analytical approximations for partition function, free energy, and statistical distributions of occupation numbers of different single-particle energy levels. At temperatures below the critical point of phase transition, we predict, in some ranges of $\mathbf{P}$, fragmentation of the condensate, when more than one single-particle level is macroscopically occupied. The occupation number distributions have approximately Gaussian shapes for the levels hosting the condensate, and exponential shapes for other, noncondensate levels. Our analysis demonstrates breaking of Galilean invariance of moving finite-temperature many-particle system in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation and extends the theory of moving and rotating quantum systems to the finite-temperature large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>System-bath correlations and finite-time operation enhance the efficiency of a dissipative quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced state of a small system strongly coupled to a thermal bath may be athermal and used as a small battery once disconnected. If the disconnecting process is too slow, the coupling between the battery and the bath weakens, and at some point, the battery will be in a thermal state that can not be used as a battery. Thus, the unitarily extractable energy (a.k.a ergotropy) decreases with the disconnection time. The work required to disconnect the battery also depends on the disconnection time. We study the efficiency of this battery, defined as the ratio between the ergotropy to the work cost of disconnecting and connecting the battery back to the bath to close the cycle, as a function of the disconnecting time in the Caldeira-Leggett model of a quantum battery. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the discharged battery is uncorrelated to the bath at the connecting time and find that the efficiency peaks at an optimal disconnecting time. In the second scenario, the discharged battery is correlated to the bath, and find that the optimal efficiency corresponds to an instantaneous disconnection. On top of these results, we analyze various thermodynamic quantities for these Caldeira-Leggett quantum batteries that allow us to express the first and second laws of thermodynamics in the mentioned cycles in simple form despite the system-bath initial correlations and strong coupling regime of the working device.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Integration for Dynamically Unstable Systems Using Interatomic Force Constants without Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient and accurate, general-purpose first-principles blueprint for calculating anharmonic vibrational free energy and predicting structural phase transition temperatures of solids. Thermodynamic integration is performed without molecular dynamics using only interatomic force constants to model analogues of the true potential and generate their thermal ensembles. By replacing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) with statistical sampling of ensemble configurations and trading density-functional theory (DFT) energy calculations on each configuration for a set of matrix operations, our approach enables a faster thermodynamic integration by 4 orders of magnitude over the traditional route via AIMD. Experimental phase transition temperatures of a variety of strongly anharmonic materials with dynamical instabilities including shape-memory alloys are recovered to largely within 25% error. Such a combination of speed and accuracy enables the method to be deployed at a large-scale for predictive mapping of phase transition temperatures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol that gives access to out-of-time-ordered correlation functions in many-body quantum systems. Unlike other such protocols, our proposal, which can be applied to arbitrary initial states, neither requires ancilla degrees of freedom to the quantum system of interest, nor has the need for randomized measurements. Nontrivial experimental capabilities required to implement the protocol are single-site measurements, single-site rotations, and backwards time evolution. To exemplify the implementation of the protocol, we put forward a strategy for Hamiltonian sign inversion $H\to-H$ in arrays of Rydberg-dressed atoms. In this way, a complete and practical toolbox is obtained for the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlations in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the spin functional renormalization group to investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By incorporating sum rules associated with the fixed length of the spin operators as well as the nontrivial quantum dynamics implied by the spin algebra, we are able to compute the ground state phase diagram for arbitrary spin $S$, including the quantum paramagnetic phase at strong frustration. Our prediction for the extent of this paramagnetic region for $ S = 1/2 $ agrees well with other approaches that are computationally more expensive. We find that the quantum paramagnetic phase disappears for $ S \gtrsim 5 $ due to the suppression of quantum fluctuations with increasing $S$.</description>

Abstract: A substantial gap persists in understanding the reasons behind the exceptional performance of the Transformer architecture in NLP. A particularly unexplored area involves the mechanistic description of how the distribution of parameters evolves over time during training. In this work we suggest that looking at the time evolution of the statistic distribution of model parameters, and specifically at bifurcation effects, can help understanding the model quality, potentially reducing training costs and evaluation efforts and empirically showing the reasons behind the effectiveness of weights sparsification.</description>

Abstract: The two-dimensional (2d) Ising model is the statistical physics textbook example for phase transitions and their kinetics. Quenched through the Curie point with Glauber rates, the late-time description of the ferromagnetic domain coarsening finds its place at the scalar sector of the Allen-Cahn (Model A) class. Resisting exact results sought since Lifshitz's account in 1962, central quantities in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions $-$ remain known up to approximate theories whose disparate outcomes urge experimental assessment. Here, we perform such assessment from a comprehensive study of the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics is induced by a super-fast switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a two-phase concurrent, equilibrium one. Tracking the dynamics via optical microscopy, we firstly show the sharp evidence of well-established Model A aspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling hypothesis, to then move forward. We confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for Porod's regime describing intradomain length scales of spatial correlators, and show that their nontrivial decay beyond that regime is captured in a free-from-parameter fashion by Gaussian theories. These paradigmatic theories, however, do not perform well for time-related Model A statistics. We reveal that the collapsed form of two-time correlators is best accounted for by the local scaling invariance theory, along with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also suggest the true value for the local persistence exponent, in disfavour of Gaussian models, and extract a universal fractal dimension for the morphology of persistence clusters that is notably close to the golden ratio. Given its accuracy and possibilities, this experimental setup may work as a prototype to address universality issues in the realm of nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of the growth kinetics on solute diffusion in porous films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11376</link>

Abstract: For the development of porous materials with improved transport properties, a key missing ingredient is to determine the relations between growth kinetics, structure, and transport parameters. Here, we address these relations by studying solute diffusion through three-dimensional porous films produced by simple deposition models with controlled thickness and porosity. We simulate growing films with competitive aggregation rules that incorporate lateral aggregation (relative rate proportional to $p$), which leads to pore formation, and surface relaxation ($1-p$) that favors compaction. By connecting a solute source at the basis and a drain at the top outer surface of the films, we extract the effective diffusion coefficients from steady-state simulations. We find that for a given film thickness, the larger the $p$, the larger the effective porosity and diffusivity, but the smaller the tortuosity. Keeping constant growth conditions (i.e., same $p$), the increase of thickness always leads to an increase of effective porosity, but a nontrivial behavior in the diffusivity occurs: for $p\leq 0.7$, the diffusion coefficient is larger in thicker films; this is accompanied by a decrease of the tortuosity with the thickness, thus indicating that growth continuously improves pore structure for diffusion. Microscopically, such a result is associated with narrower distributions of local solute currents at higher points of films. Particularly for $p\geq 0.9$, in which film porosity is $\sim 0.65-0.7$, the tortuosity is between $1.3$ and $2$, increases with the thickness, and has maximal changes near $25\%$. Pairs of values of porosity and tortuosity that we obtain here, for the thickest films, agree with those experimentally measured in some porous electrodes. Noteworthy, the increase of film thickness is generally favorable for diffusion in their pores, and exceptions have small losses in tortuosity.</description>

      <title>Defining an universal "sign" to strictly probe phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science \textbf{375}, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

      <title>From the XXZ chain to the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder via non-invertible duality defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14081v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly interacting models often possess "dualities" subtler than a one-to-one mapping of energy levels. The maps can be non-invertible, as apparent in the canonical example of Kramers and Wannier. We analyse an algebraic structure common to the XXZ spin chain and three other models: Rydberg-blockade bosons with one particle per square of a ladder, a three-state antiferromagnet, and two Ising chains coupled in a zigzag fashion. The structure yields non-invertible maps between the four models while also guaranteeing all are integrable. We construct these maps explicitly utilising topological defects coming from fusion categories and the lattice version of the orbifold construction, and use them to give explicit conformal-field-theory partition functions describing their critical regions. The Rydberg and Ising ladders also possess interesting non-invertible symmetries, with the spontaneous breaking of one in the former resulting in an unusual ground-state degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics approach to dynamical quantum phase transitions: the Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model. The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group (RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order, despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG transformations expressed as rational functions.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Ramped Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically driven extended XY model, in the presence of linear time dependent magnetic filed, is investigated using the notion of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Along the similar lines to the equilibrium phase transition, the main purpose of this work is to search the fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality at the ramped quench DQPTs. We have shown that the critical points of the model, where the gap closing occurs, can be moved by tuning the driven frequency and consequently the presence/absence of DQPTs can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the driven frequency. %Taking advantage of this property, We have uncovered that, for a ramp across the single quantum critical point, the critical mode at which DQPTs occur is classified into three regions: the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) region, where the critical mode scales linearly with the square root of the sweep velocity, pre-saturated (PS) region, and the saturated (S) region where the critical mode makes a plateau versus the sweep velocity. While for a ramp that crosses two critical points, the critical modes disclose just KZ and PS regions. On the basis of numerical simulations, we find that the dynamical free energy scales linerly with time, as approaches to DQPT time, with the exponent $\nu=1\pm 0.01$ for all sweep velocities and driven frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension, with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge, which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.</description>

Abstract: In this work we modify the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have non-linearly coupled noise). We introduce ghost Martin-Siggia-Rose (gMSR) action for the KPZ equation with Faddeev-Popov ghosts to compute an auxiliary functional determinant. We integrate out the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to leading order and the auxiliary MSR Lagrange multiplierexactly to obtain and action for the height. We analyze it within the gaussian, meanfield and Landau free energy like approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces.</description>

      <title>Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.08679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any given density matrix can be represented as an infinite number of ensembles of pure states. This leads to the natural question of how to uniquely select one out of the many, apparently equally suitable, possibilities. Following Jaynes' information-theoretic perspective, this can be framed as an inference problem. We propose the Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy Principle to exploit the notions of Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Quantum Entropy. These allow us to quantify the entropy of fully arbitrary ensembles and select the one that maximizes it. After formulating the principle mathematically, we give the analytical solution to the maximization problem in a number of cases and discuss the physical mechanism behind the emergence of such maximum entropy ensembles.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in the partially disordered random regular graphs of degree d, i.e., with a fraction $\beta$ of the sites being disordered, while the rest remain clean. It is shown that the mobility edge in the spectrum survives in {a certain range of parameters} $(d,\beta)$ at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder. The critical curve separating extended and localized states is derived analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and understood.</description>

Abstract: Krylov methods have reappeared recently, connecting physically sensible notions of complexity with quantum chaos and quantum gravity. In these developments, the Hamiltonian and the Liouvillian are tridiagonalized so that Schrodinger/Heisenberg time evolution is expressed in the Krylov basis. In the context of Schrodinger evolution, this tridiagonalization has been carried out in Random Matrix Theory. We extend these developments to Heisenberg time evolution, describing how the Liouvillian can be tridiagonalized as well until the end of Krylov space. We numerically verify the analytical formulas both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian matrix models.</description>
