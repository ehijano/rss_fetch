      <title>Post-Covid learning assessment of school children: A Project by CRY &amp; RILM across four states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic struck education system around the globe and initiated an immediate and complete lockdown of all the educational institutions, to maintain social distancing. CRY (Child Rights and You) in collaboration with RILM (Rotary India Literacy Mission) initiated a project to assess the learning abilities of 4000 children across four states: Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Jharkhand, Manipur and West Bengal. Every child was provided with the books of appropriate class according to their age in order to test their competency in reading and basic calculation as well and thereafter the compatible class was determined. The assessments were carried over 3 quarters in 4 subjects: oral assessments in 1st Language, 2nd Language and Mathematics and a writing assessment and a binary variable for improvement or no improvement (1/0) was provided. This paper suggests a measure which gives a unique score for improvement level of students with varied class lag since it will not be a desirable idea to grade the students with varied class lags on the same basis. This paper also investigates and evaluates the progression of student performance over the 3 quarters, suggests the use of a comprehensive score measure for summarising the inter-quarter performance. The analysis of progression has been carried out by gender and state level for male-female and inter state comparison respectively.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Based Ad Auctions and Bayesian Persuasion: An Analysis of Advertiser Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how ad platforms can utilize Bayesian persuasion within blockchain-based auction systems to strategically influence advertiser behavior despite increased transparency. By integrating game-theoretic models with machine learning techniques and the principles of blockchain technology, we analyze the role of strategic information disclosure in ad auctions. Our findings demonstrate that even in environments with inherent transparency, ad platforms can design signals to affect advertisers' beliefs and bidding strategies. A detailed case study illustrates how machine learning can predict advertiser responses to different signals, leading to optimized signaling strategies that increase expected revenue. The study contributes to the literature by extending Bayesian persuasion models to transparent systems and providing practical insights for auction design in the digital advertising industry.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Noise and Altruistic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study altruistic choices through the lens of a cognitively noisy decision-maker. I introduce a theoretical framework that demonstrates how increased cognitive noise can directionally affect altruistic decisions and put its implications to the test: In a laboratory experiment, participants make a series of binary choices between taking and giving monetary payments. In the treatment, to-be-calculated sums replace plain monetary payments, increasing the cognitive difficulty of choosing. The Treatment group exhibits a lower sensitivity towards changes in payments and decides significantly more often in favor of the other person, i.e., is more altruistic. I explore the origins of this effect with Bayesian hierarchical models and a number-comparison task, mirroring the mechanics of the altruism choices absent any altruistic preference. The treatment effect is similar in this task, suggesting that a biased perception of numerical magnitudes drives treatment differences. The probabilistic models support this interpretation. A series of additional results show a negative correlation between cognitive reflection and individual measures of cognitive noise, as well as associations between altruistic choice and number comparison. Overall, these results suggest that altruistic preferences -- and potentially social preferences more generally -- are affected by the cognitive difficulty of their implementation.</description>

      <title>Structural Change, Employment, and Inequality in Europe: an Economic Complexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural change consists of industrial diversification towards more productive, knowledge intensive activities. However, changes in the productive structure bear inherent links with job creation and income distribution. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of structural change, defined in terms of labour shifts towards more complex industries, on employment growth, wage inequality, and functional distribution of income. The analysis is conducted for European countries using data on disaggregated industrial employment shares over the period 2010-2018. First, we identify patterns of industrial specialisation by validating a country-industry industrial employment matrix using a bipartite weighted configuration model (BiWCM). Secondly, we introduce a country-level measure of labour-weighted Fitness, which can be decomposed in such a way as to isolate a component that identifies the movement of labour towards more complex industries, which we define as structural change. Thirdly, we link structural change to i) employment growth, ii) wage inequality, and iii) labour share of the economy. The results indicate that our structural change measure is associated negatively with employment growth. However, it is also associated with lower income inequality. As countries move to more complex industries, they drop the least complex ones, so the (low-paid) jobs in the least complex sectors disappear. Finally, structural change predicts a higher labour ratio of the economy; however, this is likely to be due to the increase in salaries rather than by job creation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Market Equilibrium: Evidence from a Natural Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) exhibits the capability to generate creative content akin to human output with greater efficiency and reduced costs. This groundbreaking capability, however, has ignited a debate regarding its potential to displace human creators. In light of these discussions, this paper empirically investigates the impact of generative AI on market equilibrium, in the context of China's leading art outsourcing platform. We overcome the challenge of causal inference by identifying an unanticipated and sudden leak of an advanced image-generative AI as a natural experiment. This leak precipitated a notable reduction in the production costs of anime-style images compared to other genres, thereby providing a unique opportunity for difference-in-differences comparisons. Our analysis shows that the advent of generative AI led to a 64% reduction in average prices, yet it simultaneously spurred a 121% increase in order volume and a 56% increase in overall revenue. This growth is primarily driven by the rising demand for "low-end" personal orders, rather than commercial orders. Moreover, incumbent creators retain the majority of the market share and reap the most benefits of generative AI. Our research highlights the potential of generative AI to benefit all stakeholders across the platform economy, yielding both scholarly contributions and practical implications.</description>

      <title>Is the panel fair? Evaluating panel compositions through network analysis. The case of research assessments in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In research evaluation, the fair representation of panels is usually defined in terms of observable characteristics of scholars such as gender or affiliations. An empirical strategy is proposed for exploring hidden connections between panellists such that, despite the respect of formal requirements, the panel could be considered alike as unfair with respect to the representation of diversity of research approaches and methodologies. The case study regards the three panels selected to evaluate research in economics, statistics and business during the Italian research assessment exercises. The first two panels were appointed directly by the governmental agency responsible for the evaluation, while the third was randomly selected. Hence the third panel can be considered as a control for evaluating about the fairness of the others. The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of panellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on journals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated institutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show that the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the members of the control group. Hence the composition of the first two panels should be considered as unfair, as the results of the research assessments.</description>

      <title>The Green Peace Dividend: the Effects of Militarization on Emissions and the Green Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that military buildups lead to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and can disrupt the green transition. Identifying military spending shocks, I use local projections to show that a percentage point rise in the military spending share leads to a 0.9-2\% rise in total emissions, as well as a 1\% rise in emission intensity, depending on the economy's overall emission intensity. Using a dynamic production network model calibrated for the US, I find that a permanent shock of the same size would increase total emissions by between 0.36\% and 1.81\%, and emission intensity by between 0.22\% and 1.5\%. The empirical analysis indicates that green patenting is reduced by 10-25\% following such a shock, and the model suggests that investment in renewables could be crowded out by defence spending, hindering the energy transition. These effects can significantly raise climate damages, temperatures, and can lead to a quicker exhaustion of the carbon budget.</description>

      <title>How has the war in Ukraine affected Russian sentiments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using individual-level data from Gallup World Poll and the Levada Center, we provide an in-depth analysis of how Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected sentiments in the Russian population. Our results show that after the invasion, a larger share of Russians expressed support for President Putin, optimism about the future, anti-West attitudes, and lower migration aspirations. The 2022 mobilization and the 2023 Wagner rebellion had only short-lived and no effects on sentiments, respectively. Regions with low pre-war support for Putin displayed stronger rally effects, higher casualty rates, and increased incomes, suggesting a recruitment strategy that maximizes political support. Taken together, our results suggest strong public support for the war, except among Russians abroad who became more critical of Putin in line with global views.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>
