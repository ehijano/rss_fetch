      <title>Predicting Generalized Steady States in Aperiodically Forced Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of generalized steady states (GSSs) in nonlinear mechanical systems under moderate temporally aperiodic forcing has only been shown recently. Here we derive systematic expansions for such GSSs and construct a numerical algorithm that yields explicit and arbitrarily refinable approximations for GSSs without the need for an initial convergence period. This is to be contrasted with a direct numerical integration of the system, whose convergence is hard to assess or is even undefined for short, transient forcing. When at least the linear part of the equations of motion is known, our GSS algorithm outperforms available data-driven neural-network-based techniques for predicting forced response in structural dynamics problems. In a fully equation-driven setting, our GSS computations are shown to be faster than a direct numerical integration of forced nonlinear finite-element models of beams and shells.</description>

      <title>Scattering in the Positive Energy Isosceles Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the three-body problem with positive energy, solutions which avoid triple collision have the property that the size of the triangle formed by the bodies tends to infinity as $t\rightarrow \pm\infty$. Furthermore, the triangles have well-defined asymptotic shapes $s_\pm$. The scattering problems asks which asymptotic shape $s_+$ can occur for a given choice of $s_-$. Previous work shows that this can be viewed as the problem of finding heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibrium points on a boundary manifold ``at infinity'' and some results were obtained for solutions which avoid collisions. The goal of this paper is to study the scattering effect of binary and near-triple collisions in a simple setting -- the isosceles three-body problem. The details depend on the mass parameters but in many cases, a fixed isosceles initial shape $s_-$ scatters to essentially all possible isosceles shapes $s_+$.</description>

      <title>On the Linearization of Flat Multi-Input Systems via Prolongations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine when differentially flat nonlinear control systems with more than two inputs can be rendered static feedback linearizable by prolongations of suitably chosen inputs after applying a static input transformation. Building on the structure of the time derivatives of a flat output, we derive sufficient conditions that guarantee such prolongations yield a static feedback linearizable system. In the two-input case, prior work established precise links between relative degrees, the highest derivative orders occurring in a flat parameterization, and the minimal dimension of a linearizing dynamic extension, leading to necessary and sufficient criteria for systems that become static feedback linearizable after at most two prolongations of such suitably chosen inputs. This work extends this analysis to systems with more than two inputs and derives particular results for the three-input case.</description>

      <title>A zero-one law for improvements to Dirichlet's theorem in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\psi$ be a continuous decreasing function defined on all large positive real numbers. We say that a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is $\psi$-Dirichlet if for every sufficiently large real number $t$ one can find $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$ satisfying $\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}\|^m&lt; \psi(t)$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|^n&lt;t$. By removing a technical condition from a partial zero-one law proved by Kleinbock-Str\"ombergsson-Yu, we prove a zero-one law for the Lebesgue measure of the set of $\psi$-Dirichlet matrices provided that $\psi(t)&lt;1/t$ and $t\psi(t)$ is increasing. In fact, we prove the zero-one law in a more general situation with the monotonicity assumption on $t\psi(t)$ replaced by a weaker condition. Our proof follows the dynamical approach of Kleinbock-Str\"ombergsson-Yu in reducing the question to a shrinking target problem in the space of lattices. The key new ingredient is a family of carefully chosen subsets of the shrinking targets studied by Kleinbock-Str\"ombergsson-Yu, together with a short-range mixing estimate for the associated hitting events. Our method also works for the analogous weighted problem where the relevant supremum norms are replaced by certain weighted quasi-norms.</description>

      <title>Position: Why a Dynamical Systems Perspective is Needed to Advance Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.</description>

      <title>Self-similar extinction for a fast diffusion equation with weighted absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite time extinction of any bounded solution to the fast diffusion equation with spatially inhomogeneous absorption $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m-|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ with $N\geq1$ and exponents $$ p&gt;1, \quad m_c=\frac{(N-2)_+}{N}&lt;m&lt;1, \quad \sigma&gt;\sigma_*:=\frac{2(p-1)}{1-m}, $$ is established. Moreover, the existence of self-similar solutions of the form $$ U(x,t)=(T-t)^{\alpha}f(|x|(T-t)^{\beta}), \quad \alpha=\frac{\sigma+2}{(1-m)(\sigma-\sigma_*)}, \ \beta=\frac{p-m}{(1-m)(\sigma-\sigma_*)}, $$ with $f(0)&gt;0$, $f'(0)=0$ and $$ \lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}\xi^{(\sigma+2)/(p-m)}f(\xi)=L\in(0,\infty). $$ is proved, together with some unbounded self-similar solutions as well. The property of finite time extinction is in striking contrast to the standard fast diffusion equation with absorption (that is, $\sigma=0$), where the strict positivity of solutions for any $t\in(0,\infty)$ is well-known.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Transport-Based Generative Models and Latent Geometry for Stochastic Closure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition so that a pair of disjoint Jordan regions in the sphere can be quasiconformally mapped to a pair of disks. As a consequence, we obtain a simple characterization that involves Lipschitz functions for the case that one of the Jordan regions is a half-plane. We apply these results to prove that all polynomial cusps are quasiconformally equivalent and that a quasisymmetric embedding of the union of two disjoint disks extends to a quasiconformal map of the sphere, quantitatively. Also, in combination with previous work of the author, we obtain a new characterization of compact sets that are quasiconformally equivalent to Schottky sets.</description>

      <title>Design of low-energy transfers in cislunar space using sequences of lobe dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Nature of Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems served as a tool to prepare entanglement at the beginning stage of quantum technology and more recently provides an important tool for state preparation. Dynamics given by time dependent Lindbladians are Markovian and lead to decoherence, decay of correlation and convergence to equilibrium. In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an averaging method for obtaining quasi-periodic response solutions in perturbed, real analytic, quasi-periodic systems with Diophantine frequency vectors. Under the assumptions that the averaged system possesses a non-degenerate equilibrium and that the eigenvalues of its linearized matrix are pairwise distinct, we show that the original system admits a quasi-periodic response solution for parameters in a Cantorian set. The proof relies on KAM techniques. It is worth mentioning that our results do not require the equilibrium to be hyperbolic, meaning that the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix of the averaged system may be purely imaginary. Furthermore, the proposed averaging method is applicable to second-order systems, and a higher-order averaging framework is also established.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the correlation between $k$-type dynamical properties of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions on compact metric spaces and their induced actions on the corresponding hyperspaces. We extend the classical results from discrete dynamical systems and general group actions to the specific setting of $k$-type dynamics. Specifically, we define and study $k$-type transitivity, $k$-type mixing, $k$-type weak mixing, and $k$-type Li-Yorke chaos for induced hyperspace actions, establishing that these properties transfer from the base system to the hyperspace under appropriate conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Memory Effects: Sparse Identification in Vector-Borne Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the human burden of vector-borne diseases from limited surveillance data remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of nonlinear transmission dynamics and delayed effects arising from vector ecology and human behavior. We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems and Quantitative Statistical Stability for the Equilibrium States of Piecewise Partially Hyperbolic Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes limit theorems and quantitative statistical stability for a class of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps that are not necessarily continuous nor locally invertible. By employing a flexible functional-analytic framework that bypasses the classical requirement of compact embeddings between Banach spaces, we obtain explicit rates of convergence for the variation of equilibrium states under perturbations. Furthermore, we prove the exponential decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem for H\"older observables. A key feature of our approach is its applicability to systems where traditional spectral gap techniques fail due to the presence of singularities and the lack of invertibility. We provide several examples illustrating the scope of our results, including partially hyperbolic attractors over horseshoes, non-invertible dynamics semi-conjugated to Manneville--Pomeau maps, and fat solenoidal attractors.</description>

      <title>On structural contraction of biological interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological networks are customarily described as structurally robust. This means that they often function extremely well under large forms of perturbations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters. In order to explain this property, various mathematical notions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity, building on the previous work of the authors. That previous work characterized the long-term dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on "rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect to non-standard polyhedral $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that such networks are nonexpansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate our theory with examples drawn from the modeling of intracellular signaling pathways.</description>

Abstract: Auction is applied for trade with various mechanisms. A simple but practical question is which mechanism, typically first-price or second-price auctions, is preferred from the perspective of bidders or sellers. A celebrated answer is revenue equivalence, where each bidder's equilibrium payoff is proven to be independent of auction mechanisms (and a seller's revenue, too). In reality, however, auction environments like the value distribution of items would vary over time, and such equilibrium bidding cannot always be achieved. Indeed, bidders must continue to track their equilibrium bidding by learning in first-price auctions, but they can keep their equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. This study discusses whether and how revenue equivalence is violated in the long run by comparing the time series of non-equilibrium bidding in first-price auctions with those of equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. We characterize the value distribution by two parameters: its basis value, which means the lowest price to bid, and its value interval, which means the width of possible values. Surprisingly, our theorems and experiments find that revenue equivalence is broken by the correlation between the basis value and the value interval, uncovering a novel phenomenon that could occur in the real world.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Martin Boundary and the Nonlinear Multiplicative Stochastic Heat Equation in Weak Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear multiplicative stochastic heat equation on Dirichlet spaces with white in time noise under weak disorder. We show that positive invariant random fields with uniformly bounded second moments are in one-to-one correspondence with bounded positive harmonic functions. The proof combines a remote past pullback construction with a uniqueness argument that applies a contraction inspired by chaos expansion. As a consequence, the space of invariant measures inherits geometric structure from the Martin Boundary. We further establish a small-noise Gaussian fluctuation result within each harmonic sector and show that the long-time behavior of solutions is completely determined by the Martin boundary data of the initial condition. These results reveal a direct connection between stochastic PDE dynamics and boundary theory in potential analysis.</description>
