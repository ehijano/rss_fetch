      <title>Transitional supersolidity in ion doped helium droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^4$He nanodroplets doped with an alkali ion feature a snowball of crystallized layers surrounded by superfluid helium. For large droplets, we predict that a transitional supersolid layer can form, bridging between the solid core and the liquid bulk, where the $^4$He density displays modulations of icosahedral group symmetry. To identify the different phases, we combine density functional theory with the semiclassical Gaussian time-dependent Hartree method for localized many-body systems. This hybrid approach can handle large particle numbers and provides insight into the physical origin of the supersolid layer. For small droplets, we verify that the predictions of our approach are in excellent agreement with Path-Integral Monte Carlo calculations.</description>

      <title>Condensate ground states of hardcore bosons induced by an array of impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neither hardcore bosons nor fermions can occupy the same lattice site-state. However, a nearest neighbour interaction may counteract the hardcore effect, resulting in condensate states in a bosonic system. In this work, we unveil the underlying mechanism by developing a general method to construct the condensate eigenstates from those of sub-Hamiltonians. As an application, we find that a local on-site potential can induce an evanescent condensate mode. Based on this, exact condensate ground states of hardcore bosons, possessing off-diagonal long-range order, can be constructed when an array of impurities is applied. The effect of the off-resonance impurity on the condensate ground states is also investigated using numerical simulations of the dynamic response.</description>

      <title>Optical probes of coherence in two dimensional Bose gases of polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their photonic components, exciton-polariton systems provide a convenient platform to study the coherence properties of weakly-interacting Bose gases and the Bose-Einstein condensate transition. In particular, optical interferometry enables the measurement of the first-order coherence function which provides insight into the phase of the system. In this paper, we analyze the buildup of coherence in finite-sized, noninteracting, equilibrium Bose gases through the condensate fraction and the related coherent fraction, defined via the first-order coherence function. Our results provide a baseline to compare against experimental data. Discrepancies may indicate where interacting or nonequilibrium models are necessary to describe the system. In the normal phase, before the Bose-Einstein condensate transition, Bose gases exhibit partial spatial and temporal coherence. This significantly alters the paraxial propagation and interference of optical signals from exciton-polariton systems. Therefore, we also analyze diffraction related to the introduction of apertures and time-delay between interferometry arms, given the partial coherence of the source. Comparison to experiment shows remarkable agreement with the noninteracting Bose gas theory, even approaching the quasi-condensate regime.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Model for Exciton-Polaron Formation in Moir\'e Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between excitons and correlated electronic states presents a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce a purely electronic model for the formation of exciton-polarons in moir\'e lattices. Unlike conventional approaches that treat excitons as tightly-bound bosonic particles, our model considers only electronic degrees of freedom, describing excitons as electron-hole bound states. Our findings reveal a pronounced renormalization of the polaron mass as a function of electron density, particularly near correlated insulators, consistent with recent transport experiments. Additionally, we predict an observable sign change in the effective polaron mass when increasing the electron density that can be measured in Hall-type experiments. Our purely electronic model provides a unified framework to investigate the formation and renormalization of exciton-polarons in correlated states.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum drives: Hyperbolically driven quantum systems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical construction of driven quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in a time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian with a structured temporal profile and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We explain how our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally novel classes of quantum dynamics: by steering a quantum Hamiltonian using a classical particle freely moving on a compact 2d hyperbolic Riemann surface called the Bolza surface, we demonstrate an example of a hyperbolically driven quantum system. We show that fully gapped hyperbolically driven quantum systems in the adiabatic limit are topologically classified by a quantized dynamical response. We propose geometric quantum driving to be a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems, which can be realized with time-dependent controls available in modern day quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Interaction quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas is a highly correlated quantum state of strongly interacting bosons confined to one dimension, where repulsive interactions make the particles behave like impenetrable fermions. By suddenly tuning these interactions to the attractive regime, it is possible to realize a super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas -- a highly excited, metastable state of strongly attractive bosons with unique stability properties. Inspired by the sTG quench scenario, we investigate a similar setup but with the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions, which modify the system away from the TG Mott insulating limit. We simulate an interaction quench on dipolar bosons initially prepared in various states and fillings, using real-space densities, orbital occupations, Glauber correlation functions, and autocorrelation functions to probe post-quench stability. Our results reveal that stability is maintained only at very weak dipolar interaction strengths when starting from a unit-filled TG Mott state. In contrast, all cluster states -- whether unit-filled or doubly-filled -- eventually collapse under attractive interactions. This collapse is not always visible in the density profile but becomes apparent in the autocorrelation function, indicating complex many-body restructuring of the quantum state. Our findings underscore the potential of dipolar interactions to drive novel quantum dynamics and highlight the delicate balance required to stabilize excited states in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states in free boson systems: Random sampling approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics</title>

Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</description>
