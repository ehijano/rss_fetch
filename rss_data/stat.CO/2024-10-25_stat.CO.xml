      <title>Saddlepoint Monte Carlo and its Application to Exact Ecological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming X is a random vector and A a non-invertible matrix, one sometimes need to perform inference while only having access to samples of Y = AX. The corresponding likelihood is typically intractable. One may still be able to perform exact Bayesian inference using a pseudo-marginal sampler, but this requires an unbiased estimator of the intractable likelihood.
  We propose saddlepoint Monte Carlo, a method for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the density of Y with very low variance, for any model belonging to an exponential family. Our method relies on importance sampling of the characteristic function, with insights brought by the standard saddlepoint approximation scheme with exponential tilting. We show that saddlepoint Monte Carlo makes it possible to perform exact inference on particularly challenging problems and datasets. We focus on the ecological inference problem, where one observes only aggregates at a fine level. We present in particular a study of the carryover of votes between the two rounds of various French elections, using the finest available data (number of votes for each candidate in about 60,000 polling stations over most of the French territory).
  We show that existing, popular approximate methods for ecological inference can lead to substantial bias, which saddlepoint Monte Carlo is immune from. We also present original results for the 2024 legislative elections on political centre-to-left and left-to-centre conversion rates when the far-right is present in the second round. Finally, we discuss other exciting applications for saddlepoint Monte Carlo, such as dealing with aggregate data in privacy or inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Spatial Median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a nonparametric clustering stopping rule algorithm based on the spatial median. Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive reduced tempering For Bayesian inverse problems and rare event simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for solving inverse Bayesian problems in a context where a (costly) likelihood evaluation can be approximated by a surrogate, constructed from previous evaluations of the true likelihood. A rough error estimation of the obtained surrogates is required. The method is based on an adaptive sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) simulation that jointly adapts the likelihood approximations and a standard tempering scheme of the target posterior distribution. This algorithm is well-suited to cases where the posterior is concentrated in a rare and unknown region of the prior. It is also suitable for solving low-temperature and rare-event simulation problems. The main contribution is to propose an entropy criteria that associates to the accuracy of the current surrogate a maximum inverse temperature for the likelihood approximation. The latter is used to sample a so-called snapshot, perform an exact likelihood evaluation, and update the surrogate and its error quantification. Some consistency results are presented in an idealized framework of the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments use in particular a reduced basis approach to construct approximate parametric solutions of a partially observed solution of an elliptic Partial Differential Equation. They demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm and show a significant cost reduction (close to a factor $10$) for comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>AutoStep: Locally adaptive involutive MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels can be formulated using a deterministic involutive proposal with a step size parameter. Selecting an appropriate step size is often a challenging task in practice; and for complex multiscale targets, there may not be one choice of step size that works well globally. In this work, we address this problem with a novel class of involutive MCMC methods -- AutoStep MCMC -- that selects an appropriate step size at each iteration adapted to the local geometry of the target distribution. We prove that AutoStep MCMC is $\pi$-invariant and has other desirable properties under mild assumptions on the target distribution $\pi$ and involutive proposal. Empirical results examine the effect of various step size selection design choices, and show that AutoStep MCMC is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of effective sample size per unit cost on a range of challenging target distributions.</description>

      <title>Tuning-free coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian coreset is a small, weighted subset of a data set that replaces the full data during inference to reduce computational cost. The state-of-the-art coreset construction algorithm, Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo (Coreset MCMC), uses draws from an adaptive Markov chain targeting the coreset posterior to train the coreset weights via stochastic gradient optimization. However, the quality of the constructed coreset, and thus the quality of its posterior approximation, is sensitive to the stochastic optimization learning rate. In this work, we propose a learning-rate-free stochastic gradient optimization procedure, Hot-start Distance over Gradient (Hot DoG), for training coreset weights in Coreset MCMC without user tuning effort. Empirical results demonstrate that Hot DoG provides higher quality posterior approximations than other learning-rate-free stochastic gradient methods, and performs competitively to optimally-tuned ADAM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reduced Multilevel Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the classical problem of sampling with Monte Carlo methods a target rare event distribution defined by a score function that is very expensive to compute. We assume we can build using evaluations of the true score, an approximate surrogate score certified with error bounds. This work proposes a fully adaptive algorithm to sequentially sample surrogate rare event distributions with increasing target levels. An essential contribution consists in sampling at each iteration the surrogate rare event at a critical level corresponding to a specific cost. This cost is related to importance sampling for a target for a given budget. The critical level is calculated solely from the reduced score and its error bound From a practical point of view, sampling the proposal sequence is performed by extending the framework of the popular adaptive multilevel splitting algorithm to the use of score approximations. Numerical experiments evaluate the proposed importance sampling algorithm in terms of computational complexity versus squared error. In particular, we investigate the performance of the algorithm when simulating rare events related to the solution of a parametric PDE, which is approximated by a reduced basis.</description>

      <title>Tail-adaptive Bayesian shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust Bayesian methods for high-dimensional regression problems under diverse sparse regimes are studied. Traditional shrinkage priors are primarily designed to detect a handful of signals from tens of thousands of predictors in the so-called ultra-sparsity domain. However, they may not perform desirably when the degree of sparsity is moderate. In this paper, we propose a robust sparse estimation method under diverse sparsity regimes, which has a tail-adaptive shrinkage property. In this property, the tail-heaviness of the prior adjusts adaptively, becoming larger or smaller as the sparsity level increases or decreases, respectively, to accommodate more or fewer signals, a posteriori. We propose a global-local-tail (GLT) Gaussian mixture distribution that ensures this property. We examine the role of the tail-index of the prior in relation to the underlying sparsity level and demonstrate that the GLT posterior contracts at the minimax optimal rate for sparse normal mean models. We apply both the GLT prior and the Horseshoe prior to a real data problem and simulation examples. Our findings indicate that the varying tail rule based on the GLT prior offers advantages over a fixed tail rule based on the Horseshoe prior in diverse sparsity regimes.</description>
