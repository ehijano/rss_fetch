      <title>Properties of states near $E_x$ = 6 MeV in $^{18}$Ne through $^{17}$F+p scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The rate of energy production in the hot-CNO cycle and breakout to the rapid-proton capture process in Type I X-ray bursts is strongly related to the $^{14}$O($\alpha,p$)$^{17}$F reaction rate. The properties of states in $^{18}$Ne near $E_x=6.1-6.3$ MeV are important for understanding this reaction rate.
  Experiment: The RESOLUT radioactive-ion beam facility at Florida State University was used to study $^{18}$Ne resonances around this energy region using $^{17}$F(p,p)$^{17}$F elastic scattering on a polypropylene target under inverse kinematics. Scattered protons were detected in a silicon-strip detector array while recoiling $^{17}$F ions were detected in coincidence in a gas ionization detector.
  Analysis: An $R$-matrix analysis of measured cross sections was conducted along with a reanalysis of data from previous measurements.
  Results: All the data analyzed are well described by a consistent set of parameters with with a $1^-$ assignment for a state at 6.14(1) MeV. A second comparable solution is also found with a $3^-$ assignment for the 6.14(1) MeV state. The rate of the $^{14}$O($\alpha$,p)$^{17}$F reaction that is determined from the two solutions differs by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the $^{15}\text{Be}$ ground state from $^{12}$Be$+3$n events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: $^{15}$Be is an unbound nuclide that has been observed to decay by one-neutron emission. Shell model calculations predict two low-lying states in its energy spectrum, however, only a single resonance has been observed from coincident measurements of $^{14}$Be+n. It has been suggested that the yet unobserved state may decay sequentially through the first excited state in $^{14}$Be followed by a two-neutron emission to $^{12}$Be.
  Purpose: The ground state of $^{15}$Be has yet to be confirmed. A search for this predicted $^{15}$Be state by reconstructing $^{12}$Be$+3$n events allows a possible determination of its ground state properties.
  Methods: A neutron-pickup reaction was performed with a $^{14}$Be beam on a CD$_2$ target to populate unbound $^{15}$Be states. Decay energies were reconstructed using invariant mass spectroscopy by detecting $^{12}$Be daughter nuclei in coincidence with up to three neutrons.
  Results: Evidence for at least one resonance in $^{15}$Be is presented based on the reconstruction of $^{12}$Be$+3$n events. Through comparison with simulations, the energy of the strongest resonance in the analyzed reaction and decay channel is determined to be $E_{^{12}Be+3n}=330(20)$ keV.
  Conclusions: The inclusion of a new $^{15}$Be state among the $^{12}$Be+$3$n events lower in relative decay energy than the previous $^{14}$Be+n observations provides the best fit to the data. Because this suggested new state would be lower in energy than the previously observed state, it is a candidate for the ground state of $^{15}$Be.</description>

      <title>Recent results on the low-pressure GEM-based TPC at an Accelerator Mass Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Accelerator Mass Spectrometry technique makes it possible to measure rare long-lived isotopes such as $^{10}$Be, $^{14}$C, $^{26}$Al, $^{36}$Cl, $^{41}$Ca and $^{129}$I. The content of these isotopes can be at the level of 10$^{-15}$ of the total element content. The Accelerator Mass Spectrometer developed by Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP AMS) successfully measures the concentration of $^{14}$C relative $^{12}$C. However, there is a problem of separating the $^{10}$B isobaric background from $^{10}$Be. Beryllium-10 is used to date geological objects on a time scale from 1 thousand years to 10 million years.
  To solve this problem we have proposed a new technique for ion identification based on measuring both ion track ranges and ion energies in a low-pressure Time-Projection Chamber (TPC) with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout. We have developed the TPC with a dedicated thin silicon nitride window for an efficient passage of ions. To begin with, the characteristic of the low-pressure TPC were studied in isobutane at a pressure of 50 torr using alpha particle sources.
  In this work, we set up the low-pressure TPC on BINP AMS facility and successfully measured track ranges and energies of ions from samples containing $^{14}$C. At the next stage, we are going to carry out measurements with samples containing $^{10}$Be. However, using the obtained results and SRIM simulation we have already shown that the isobaric boron and beryllium ions can be separated by more than 5 sigma. This technique is proposed to be applied in AMS for dating geological objects, namely for geochronology of Cenozoic era.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for collective excitations of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective modes emerge as the relevant degrees of freedom that govern low-energy excitations of atomic nuclei. These modes - rotations, pairing rotations, and vibrations - are separated in energy from non-collective excitations, making it possible to describe them in the framework of effective field theory. Rotations and pairing rotations are the remnants of Nambu-Goldstone modes from the emergent breaking of rotational symmetry and phase symmetries in finite deformed and finite superfluid nuclei, respectively. The symmetry breaking severely constrains the structure of low-energy Lagrangians and thereby clarifies what is essential and simplifies the description. The approach via effective field theories exposes the essence of nuclear collective excitations and is defined with a breakdown scale in mind. This permits one to make systematic improvements and to estimate and quantify uncertainties. Effective field theories of collective excitations have been used to compute spectra, transition rates, and other matrix elements of interest. In particular, predictions of the nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double beta decay then come with quantified uncertainties. This review summarizes these results and also compares the approach via effective field theories to well-known models and ab initio computations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the equation-of-state from low energy heavy-ion collisions within the PHQMD microscopic approach with momentum-dependent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the equation-of-state (EoS) of nuclear matter on collective observables, the directed ($v_1$) and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of nucleons and light clusters in heavy-ion collisions at GeV beam energies employing the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic transport approach. Here the clusters are formed dynamically during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons, including additionally deuteron production by hadronic kinetic reactions. We employ three different EoS - realized via potential interactions: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS, adjusted to pA elastic scattering data. We find that the momentum dependent potential has different consequences for rapidity and transverse momentum spectra than for flow coefficients. We obtain the best description of the HADES and FOPI data on the directed and elliptic flow coefficients of protons and light clusters applying a momentum dependent EoS. Moreover, we observe a scaling behavior of $v_2$ versus $p_T$ with atomic number $A$. Finally we demonstrate that flow observables can help to identify the cluster production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Imaging Shapes of Atomic Nuclei in High-Energy Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometer-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging'' method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground state Uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.</description>

      <title>The $v^{1/3}_{3}/v^{1/2}_{2}$ ratio in PbAu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = $ 17.3 GeV: a hint of a hydrodynamic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fourier harmonics, $v_2$ and $v_3$ of negative pions are measured at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$= 17.3 GeV around midrapidity by the CERES/NA45 experiment at the CERN SPS in 0--30\% central PbAu collisions with a mean centrality of 5.5\%. The analysis is performed in two centrality bins as a function of the transverse momentum $\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}$ from 0.05 GeV/$c$ to more than 2 GeV/$c$. This is the first measurement of the $v^{1/3}_{3}/v^{1/2}_{2}$ ratio as a function of transverse momentum at SPS energies, that reveals, independently of the hydrodynamic models, hydrodynamic behavior of the formed system. For $\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}$ above 0.5 GeV/$c$, the ratio is nearly flat in accordance with the hydrodynamic prediction and as previously observed by the ATLAS and ALICE experiments at the much higher LHC energies. The results are also compared with the SMASH-vHLLE hybrid model predictions, as well as with the SMASH model applied alone.</description>

      <title>Observation of double J/$\psi$ meson production in pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observation of the concurrent production of two J/$\psi$ mesons in proton-nucleus collisions is presented. The analysis is based on a proton-lead (pPb) data sample recorded at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$. The two J/$\psi$ mesons are reconstructed in their $\mu^+\mu^-$ decay channels with transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\gt$ 6.5 GeV and rapidity $\lvert y \rvert$ $\lt$ 2.4. Events where one of the J/$\psi$ mesons is reconstructed in the dielectron channel are also considered in the search. The pPb $\to$ J/$\psi$J/$\psi$ + X process is observed with a significance of 5.3 standard deviations. The measured inclusive fiducial cross section, using the four-muon channel alone, is $\sigma$(pPb $\to$ J/$\psi$J/$\psi$ + X) = 22.0 $\pm$ 8.9 (stat) $\pm$ 1.5 (syst) nb. A fit of the data to the expected rapidity separation for pairs of J/$\psi$ mesons produced in single (SPS) and double (DPS) parton scatterings yields $\sigma^{\mathrm{pPb} \to \mathrm{J}/\psi\mathrm{J}/\psi +\mathrm{X}}_\text{SPS}$ = 16.5 $\pm$ 10.8 (stat) $\pm$ 0.1 (syst) nb and $\sigma^{\mathrm{pPb} \to \mathrm{J}/\psi\mathrm{J}/\psi + \mathrm{X}}_\text{DPS}$ = 5.4 $\pm$ 6.2 (stat) $\pm$ 0.4 (syst) nb, respectively. This latter result can be transformed into a lower bound on the effective DPS cross section, closely related to the squared average interparton transverse separation in the collision, of $\sigma_\text{eff}$ $\gt$ 1.0 mb at 95% confidence level.</description>
