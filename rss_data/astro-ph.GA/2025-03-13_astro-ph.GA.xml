      <title>The Complete Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (CS$^4$G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G), together with its Early Type Galaxy (ETG) extension, stand as the most extensive dataset of deep, uniform mid-infrared (mid-IR; 3.6 and 4.5$\,\mu$m) imaging for a sample of $2817$ nearby ($d&lt;40 \,$Mpc) galaxies. However, the velocity criterion used to select the original sample results in an additional 422 galaxies without HI detection that ought to have been included in the S$^4$G on the basis of their optical recession velocities. In order to create a complete magnitude-, size- and volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, we collect $3.6\,\mu$m and $i$-band images using archival data from different surveys and complement it with new observations for the missing galaxies. We denote the sample of these additional galaxies as Disc Galaxy (DG) extension. We present the Complete Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (CS$^4$G), encompassing a sample of $3239$ galaxies with consistent imaging, surface brightness profiles, photometric parameters, and revised morphological classification. Following the original strategy of the S$^4$G survey, we produce masks, surface brightness profiles, and curves of growth using masked $3.6\,\mu$m and $i$-band images. From these profiles, we derive the integrated quantities: total magnitude, stellar mass, concentration parameter, and galaxy size, converting to $3.6\,\mu$m. We re-measure these parameters also for the S$^4$G and ETG to create a homogenous sample. We present new morphological revised $T$-types, and we showcase mid-IR scaling relations for the photometric parameters. We complete the S$^4$G sample by incorporating 422 galaxies. The CS$^4$G includes at least 99.94\% of the complete sample of nearby galaxies, meeting the original selection criteria, and it will enable a wide set of investigations into galaxy structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong lensing model of MACS J0138.0$-$2155 thanks to new JWST and VLT/MUSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of $M(&lt;60~ \rm kpc) = 2.89_{-0.03}^{+0.04} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.</description>

      <title>Exploring the formation environment of multiple stellar populations in Globular Clusters through binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular Clusters (GCs) are known to host distinct stellar populations, characterized by different chemical compositions. Despite extensive research, the origin of these populations remains elusive. According to many formation scenarios, the second population (2P) originated within a compact and denser region embedded in a more extended first population (1P) system. As a result, 2P binaries should be disrupted at a larger rate than 1P binaries. For this reason, binary systems offer valuable insight into the environments in which these stellar populations formed and evolved. In this research, we analyze the fraction of binaries among 1P and 2P M dwarfs in the outer region of NGC 288 using Hubble Space Telescope data. We combine our results with those from a previous work, where we inferred the fraction of 1P and 2P binaries in the cluster center. In the outer region, we find a predominance of 1P binaries ($97^{+1}_{-3}\%$) compared to 2P binaries ($3\pm1\%$) corresponding to an incidence of binaries with a mass ratio (i.e., the ratio between the masses of the primary and secondary star) greater than 0.5 equal to $6.4\pm 1.7\%$ for the 1P population and $0.3\pm 0.2\%$ for the 2P population. These binary fractions and incidences differ from those found in the cluster$'$s central region, where the 1P and 2P populations exhibit similar binary incidences and fractions. These results are in general agreement with the predictions of simulations following the evolution of binary stars in multiple-population GCs, starting with a dense 2P subsystem concentrated in the central regions of a 1P system.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of central and satellite galaxies in the local universe: Insights from galactic archeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the evolution of galaxies in diverse environments, utilizing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data to explore the impact of environmental richness on central and satellite galaxies across stellar mass ranges, compared to isolated systems. The sample is limited to 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 and apparent magnitudes brighter than 17.78, ensuring spectroscopic completeness and reliable stellar population estimates. Galaxies are categorized by environment as field or cluster/group systems, with further separation into satellites and centrals. By analyzing the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass plane, this work identifies systematic differences in the blue cloud (BC), green valley (GV), and red sequence (RS) across environments. Morphological and stellar population analyses reveal that T-type, metallicity, and stellar age transitions highlight the role of environmental quenching. A newly introduced T-Type \emph{vs.} specific SFR diagram provides evidence that morphological transformation precedes full quenching. Correlating galaxy properties with time since infall through projected phase space confirms the delayed-then-rapid quenching model for low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, extending it to morphology. Time-scales for quenching and morphological transitions are also derived as a function of stellar mass.</description>

      <title>From Non-Detection to Detection: Atacama Compact Array Mosaic Observations of Faint Extended [C I] Emission in NGC 7679</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of [C I] $^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ emission in the nearby galaxy NGC 7679 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In Michiyama et al. (2021), [C I] $^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ emission in NGC 7679 was reported as undetected based on ACA observations conducted in 2019 (ALMA Cycle 6). These observations had ~1 minute on-source time and used a single pointing with a field of view (FoV) of ~20 arcsec. In 2023 (Cycle 9), we carried out mosaic observations using seven pointings with an FoV of ~27 arcsec and 4-5 minutes on-source per pointing. The additional data have significantly improved the line sensitivity, uv-sampling, and noise uniformity across the galaxy disk. Our Cycle 9 observations confirm the presence of extended [C I] $^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ emission in NGC 7679, which was completely missed in the Cycle 6 observations due to insufficient sensitivity and uv-sampling. This highlights the basic technical challenges of estimating the total flux by interferometric observations with sparse uv-sampling.</description>

      <title>The size of the Coronal Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei: a MUSE perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated by means of MUSE/VLT observations the true size of the coronal line region (CLR) in a local sample of nine active galactic nuclei known for displaying prominent coronal emission. Our analysis show that the CLR is extended from several hundred parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in the lines of [Fe VII] (IP=99 eV) and [Fe X] (IP=235 eV). In all cases, the coronal emission is closely aligned along the radio-jet axis and constrained to the limits of the [O III] ionisation cone. Besides the nuclear emission, secondary emission peaks in [Fe VII] and [Fe X] are found along the extended emission, with a shallow decrease of the line intensity with increasing distance from the AGN. Both facts suggest the action of an additional excitation mechanism besides nuclear photoionisation for the origin of the coronal gas. This is further supported by the fact that in some sources the extended coronal emission accounts for more than 50\% of the total emission and by the high degree of gas excitation in the off-nuclear region. A positive trend between the coronal line luminosity and the jet power points to shocks induced by the jet passage as the key mechanism to produce and excite this gas. We provide the first estimate of the [Fe X] coronal gas size, being in the kpc range. Our results stress the importance of the CLR as a key ingredient that should be fully considered in models trying to explain the physics of the narrow line region in AGN.</description>

      <title>Comparison of bar formation mechanisms II: does a tidally induced bar grow faster than an internally developed bar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bar structures can form internally due to the instability of their host galaxies or externally due to perturbations from other galaxies. We systematically quantify the growth timescales ($\tau_\mathrm{bar}$) of bars formed through these two mechanisms with a series of controlled $N$-body simulations. In galaxies susceptible to bar instability, tidally induced bars display $\tau_\mathrm{bar}$ values comparable to those of internally developed bars within the same disk. Tidal perturbations promote/delay bar formation by advancing/postponing its onset, but the growth rate of the bar structure remains largely unchanged. In these interaction scenarios, the bar formation is still driven primarily by the galaxy's internal nature that remains unaffected by tidal perturbations. As the external perturbation wave reaches the galaxy's center, it evokes a ''seed bar'' that is then swing amplified. In this scenario, the onset of bar formation is advanced. Conversely, bar formation may be delayed if the external perturbation wave is out of phase with the pre-existing spontaneously developed seed bar, which causes destructive interference and limits the bar growth. In the hot disk model that resists bar formation in isolation, $\tau_\mathrm{bar}$ of the tidally induced bar correlates with the strength of the perturbation. The bar growth in this model deviates from the exponential profile and is better described by a linear function. The strictly-speaking ''tidally induced bars'' may not adhere to the swing amplification mechanism that predicts an exponential bar growth. Their preference for linear growth contrasts with bars formed in galaxies inherently susceptible to bar instability.</description>

      <title>Effects of intrinsic AGN variability on optical QPOs related to sub-pc binary black hole systems in broad line AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed to test the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on expected optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) related to sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line AGN. The commonly accepted CAR (Continuous AutoRegressive) process is applied to describe intrinsic AGN variability related to each BH accreting system in a sub-pc BBH system. Considering obscurations related to orbital rotations with periodicity $T_p$, artificial light curves including signals for optical QPOs can be built. Then, comparing the intrinsic periodicities $T_p$ with the measured robust periodicities $T_o$ through the artificial light curves, distributions of $T_p/T_o$ have four significant peaks around 1, 2, 3 and 4, leading less than half of the artificial light curves to have consistency between $T_o$ and $T_p$. Moreover, different collected model parameters have few effects on the distributions of $T_p/T_o$, indicating the effects of intrinsic AGN variability on optical QPOs are significantly strong and stable. Furthermore, after checking properties of optical QPOs in the light curves with different time steps, there are tiny effects of time steps on optical QPOs.</description>

      <title>Probing the Hot Gaseous Halo of the Low-mass Disk Galaxy NGC 7793 with eROSITA and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation models predict that local galaxies are surrounded by hot X-ray-emitting halos, which are technically difficult to detect due to their extended and low surface brightness nature. Previous X-ray studies have mostly focused on disk galaxies more massive than the Milky Way, with essentially no consensus on the halo X-ray properties at the lower mass end. We utilize the early-released eROSITA and archival Chandra observations to analyze the diffuse X-ray emission of NGC7793, a nearby spiral galaxy with an estimated stellar mass of only $3.2\times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We find evidence for extraplanar hot gas emission from both the radial and vertical soft X-ray intensity profiles, which spreads up to a galactocentric distance of $\sim$ 6 kpc, nearly 30 $\%$ more extended than its stellar disk. Analysis of the eROSITA spectra indicates that the hot gas can be characterized by a temperature of $0.18^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ keV, with 0.5--2 keV unabsorbed luminosity of $1.3\times 10^{38}$ erg $s^{-1}$. We compare our results with the IllustrisTNG simulations and find overall consistence on the disk scale, whereas excessive emission at large radii is predicted by TNG50. This work provides the latest detection of hot corona around a low-mass galaxy, putting new constrains on state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We also verify the detectability of hot circumgalactic medium around even low-mass spirals with future high-resolution X-ray spectrometer such as the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor.</description>

      <title>Optical+NIR analysis of a newly found Einstein ring at z$\sim$1 from the Kilo-Degree Survey: Dark matter fraction, total and dark matter density slope and IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of a new bright blue Einstein ring in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) footprint: the Einstein ``blue eye''. Spectroscopic data from X-Shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) show that the lens is a typical early-type galaxy (ETG) at $z=0.9906$, while the background source is a Ly$\alpha$ emitter at $z=2.823$. The reference lens modeling was performed on a high-resolution $Y-$band adaptive-optics image from HAWK-I at VLT. Assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass density profile, we inferred an Einstein radius $R_{Ein}=10.47 \pm 0.06$ kpc. The average slope of the total mass density inside the Einstein radius, as determined by a joint analysis of lensing and isotropic Jeans equations is $\gamma=2.14^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, showing no systematic deviation from the slopes of lower redshit galaxies, This can be the evidence of ETGs developing through dry mergers plus moderate dissipationless accretion. Stellar population analysis with 8-band ($gri$ZYJHK$s$) photometries from KiDS and VIKING shows that the total stellar mass of the lens is $M*=(3.95\pm 0.35)\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ (Salpeter Initial Mass Function, IMF), implying a dark matter fraction inside the effective radius to be $f_{\rm DM}=0.307\pm 0.151$. We finally explored the dark matter halo slope and found a strong degeneracy with the dynamic stellar mass. Dark matter adiabatic contraction is needed to explain the posterior distribution of the slope, unless IMF heavier than Salpeter is assumed.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved TRGB JWST color-magnitude as a tool to measure fossil stellar metallicity gradients in disk galaxies: NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use archival JWST/NIRCam images in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters to measure the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) magnitudes across the disk of the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. In this exploratory study, we demonstrate how the metallicity-dependence of TRGB magnitudes in the near-infrared (NIR) filters can be exploited by making use of the theoretical isochrones to determine metallicities of the fossil 10 Gyr old population over kiloparsec scales without being affected by the age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. We obtain a smooth metallicity gradient that decreases from $Z$=0.003 in the central regions to $Z$=0.002 in the external parts, with a typical error on $Z$ of 0.0002. The extinction variation across the disk caused by the diffuse interstellar dust is spiky with a median value of $A_V$=0.12 mag. We propose that the large bubbles in the disks of galaxies offer dust-free lines of sight for measuring the TRGB magnitudes, and hence the distance to galaxies, to an accuracy that is as good as that of the halo populations. Using the Phantom Void, we obtain a TRGB distance modulus of 29.81$\pm0.05(\rm stat)\pm0.06(\rm sys)$ mag for NGC 628, which agrees well with the most recent PNLF measurement of 29.89$^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ for this galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Recent wide-field galaxy surveys have led to an explosion in numbers of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidates. However, the vast majority feature massive luminous red galaxies as the main deflectors, with late-type galaxies being vastly under-represented. This work presents a dedicated search for lensing by edge-on late-type galaxies in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). The search covers $3600$ deg$^2$ of $r$-band observations taken from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We consider all sources with magnitudes in the range $17 &lt; r &lt; 20.5$, without any colour preselection, yielding a parent sample of seven million sources. We characterise our parent sample via the visual inspection of $120\,000$ sources selected at random. From it, we estimate, with a 68\% confidence interval, that 1 in every $30\,000$ sources is an edge-on lens candidate, with at least eight high-quality candidates in the parent sample. This corresponds to 1 candidate per $17\,000$ edge-on late-type galaxies. Our search relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to select a reduced sample of candidates, followed by a visual inspection to curate the final sample. The CNN is trained from scratch using simulated $r$-band observations of edge-on lenses, and real observations of non-lenses. We find 61 good edge-on lens candidates using the CNN. Moreover, combining the CNN candidates with those found serendipitously, and those identified while characterising the parent sample, we discovered 4 grade A, 20 grade B, and 58 grade C edge-on lens candidates; effectively doubling the known sample of these systems. We also discovered 16 grade A, 16 grade B, and 18 grade C lens candidates of other types. Finally, based on the characterisation of the parent sample, we estimate that our search found around 60\% of the bright grade A and B edge-on lens candidates within the parent sample.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Electron Coupling with NuSTAR Observations of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for the existence of ultralight axions coupling to electrons and photons using data from the NuSTAR telescope directed toward the galaxies M82, M87, and M31. We focus on electron bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering for axion production in stars, summing over the stellar populations found in the target galaxies when computing the axion luminosity. We then compute the hard X-ray signal that arises from the conversion of these axions to photons in each galaxy's magnetic fields, inferred from analog galaxies in cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Analyzing NuSTAR data toward these galaxies between roughly 20 to 70 keV, we find no evidence for axions and set leading constraints on the combined axion-electron and axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{aee} \times g_{a \gamma \gamma}| \lesssim 8.3 \times 10^{-27}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV at 95% confidence, with M82 providing the most stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data: WICKED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value -- more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.</description>

      <title>The Extinction Law in SN Ia Hosts from Background Galaxy Measurements: Toward a 1% Determination of $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the most precise distance ladder determination of $H_0$, the observed near-infrared (NIR) fluxes of Cepheids are corrected for dust, assuming that the extinction law in large, star-forming spiral hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) is similar to the Milky Way's average value of $R_V \approx 3.1$. Intriguingly, studies of SNe Ia often point to lower values for their hosts ($R_V \sim 2$). Ambiguities related to $R_V$ may limit future efforts to measure $H_0$ beyond $\sim 1\%$ precision. To better resolve extragalactic extinction laws, we directly measure the wavelength-dependent absorption of background galaxies seen in HST and JWST images (0.5--2.7 $\mu$m). We take the following steps: (i) subtract foreground stars to measure accurate photometry of background galaxies with a tool, $\texttt{SPHOT}$; (ii) measure their redshifts and spectroscopic features with Keck/DEIMOS; (iii) determine their intrinsic spectral energy distributions from the empirical templates which match the absorption lines and breaks in observed spectroscopic features, and (iv) measure $R_V$ by fitting the extinction model to the difference between the template and the observed SEDs. The above steps are tested with artificial datasets to insure they accurately recover the input $R_V$. We apply this set of steps to a first case, NGC 5584, a SN Ia host and a calibrator of the Hubble constant. The estimated value of $R_V$ for NGC 5584, $R_V=3.59^{+0.99}_{-0.62}(\text{stat})\pm0.19(\text{syst})$, is consistent with the MW-like extinction law, and it is $\gtrsim 3.5\sigma$ away from $R_V=2$ as favored by SN Ia. If additional hosts show similar results, it would suggest that SN Ia extinction may not be solely due to mean interstellar dust. We are now undertaking a statistical study of 5-10 SH0ES hosts to determine the distribution of host extinction laws.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155: photometry, cluster members, and lens mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Dark Matter as a Feature of Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the first analytical formula for the density of "Dark Matter" (DM) at all length scales, thus also for the rotation curves of stars in galaxies, for the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and for planetary systems, from Einstein's equations (EE) and classical approximations, in agreement with observations. DM is defined in Part I as the energy of the coherent gravitational field of the universe, represented by the additional equivalent ordinary matter (OM), needed at all length scales, to explain classically, with inclusion of the OM, the observed coherent gravitational field. Our derivation uses both EE and the Newtonian approximation of EE in Part I, to describe semi-classically in Part II the advection of DM, created at the level of the universe, into galaxies and clusters thereof. This advection happens proportional with their own classically generated gravitational field g, due to self-interaction of the gravitational field. It is based on the universal formula rD=lgg'g' for the density rD of DM advected into medium and lower scale structures of the observable universe, where l is a universal constant fixed by the Tully-Fisher relations. Here g' is the gravitational field of the universe; g' is in main part its own source, as implied in Part I from EE. We start from a simple electromagnetic analogy that helps to make the paper generally accessible. This paper allows for the first time the exact calculation of DM in galactic halos and at all levels in the universe, based on EE and Newtonian approximations, in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Tidal Disruption Events and Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei via Variation of Mid-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.</description>

      <title>GalProTE: Galactic Properties Mapping using Transformer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents GalProTE, a proof-of-concept Machine Learning model utilizing a Transformer Encoder to determine stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation from optical spectra. Designed for large astronomical surveys, GalProTE significantly accelerates processing while maintaining accuracy. Using the E-MILES spectral library, we construct a dataset of 111,936 diverse templates by expanding 636 simple stellar population models with varying extinction, spectral combinations, and noise modifications. This ensures robust training over 4750 to 7100 Angstrom at 2.5 Angstrom resolution. GalProTE employs four parallel attention-based encoders with varying kernel sizes to capture spectral features. On synthetic test data, it achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.27% between input and predicted spectra. Validation on PHANGS-MUSE galaxies NGC4254 and NGC5068 confirms its ability to extract physical parameters efficiently, with residuals averaging -0.02% and 0.28% and standard deviations of 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively. To contextualize these results, we compare GalProTE's age, metallicity, and dust attenuation maps with pPXF, a state-of-the-art spectral fitting tool. While pPXF requires approximately 11 seconds per spectrum, GalProTE processes one in less than 4 milliseconds, offering a 2750 times speedup and consuming 68 times less power per spectrum. The strong agreement between pPXF and GalProTE highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance traditional methods, paving the way for faster, energy-efficient, and scalable analyses of galactic properties in modern surveys.</description>

      <title>3D non-LTE Ca II line formation in metal-poor FGK stars. I. Abundance corrections, radial velocity corrections, and synthetic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ca II resonance doublet (HK) and the near-infrared triplet (CaT) are among the strongest features in stellar spectra of FGK-type stars. These spectral lines remain prominent down to extremely low metallicities and are thus useful for providing stellar parameters via ionisation balance and as radial velocity diagnostics. However, the majority of studies that model these lines in late-type stars still rely on one dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We present 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of the CaT and HK lines in an extended grid of 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor FGK-type. We investigate the impact of 3D non-LTE effects on abundances, line bisectors and radial velocities. We used a subset of 3D model atmospheres from the recently published STAGGER-grid to synthesize spectra in 3D (non-)LTE. For comparison, similar calculations were performed in 1D (non-)LTE using models from the MARCS grid. Abundance corrections for the CaT lines relative to 1D LTE range from +0.1 to -1.0 dex, with more severe corrections for strong lines in giants. With fixed line strength, the abundance corrections become more negative with increasing effective temperature and decreasing surface gravity. Radial velocity corrections relative to 1D LTE based on cross-correlation of the whole line profile range from -0.2 km/s to +1.5 km/s, with more severe corrections where the CaT lines are strongest. The corrections are even more severe if the line core alone is used to infer the radial velocity. The line strengths and shapes, and consequently the abundance and radial velocity corrections, are strongly affected by the chosen radiative transfer assumption, 1/3D (non)-LTE. We release grids of theoretical spectra that can be used to improve the accuracy of stellar spectroscopic analyses based on the Ca II triplet lines.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VII. Circumstellar gas kinematics traced by water masers inside the HC HII region NGC7538 IRS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on NGC7538 IRS1, one of the most luminous and studied HC HII regions in the northern hemisphere. Our aim is to identify the young stellar objects (YSOs) embedded within the ionized gas and study their kinematic structures. This work expands on a recent survey called "Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages" (POETS), which has been devoted to studying young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au near luminous YSOs, before they start photoionizing the surrounding medium. We carried out multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward NGC7538 IRS1 to measure the maser 3D velocities, which, following POETS' findings, are reliable tracers of the protostellar winds. Recently, we reobserved the water masers in NGC7538 IRS1 with sensitive global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to map weaker maser emission. Our study confirms the presence of two embedded YSOs, IRS1a and IRS1b, at the center of the two linear distributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed in the southern and northern cores of the HC HII region, which have been previously interpreted in terms of edge-on rotating disks. The water masers trace an extended (~200 au) stationary shock front adjacent to the inner portion of the disk around IRS1a. This shock front corresponds to the edge of the southern tip of the ionized core and might be produced by the interaction of the disk wind ejected from IRS1a with the infalling envelope. The water masers closer to IRS1b follow the same LSR velocity (Vlsr) pattern of the 6.7~GHz masers rotating in the disk, but the direction and amplitude of the water maser proper motions are inconsistent with rotation. We propose that these water masers are tracing a photo-evaporated disk wind, where the maser Vlsr traces mainly the disk rotation and the proper motions the poloidal velocity of the wind.</description>

Abstract: Type II Cepheids (T2Ceps), alongside RR Lyrae stars, serve as important distance indicators for old population II stars due to their period-luminosity (PL) relations. However, studies of these relations in the Sloan photometric system are rather limited in the literature. Our goal is to calibrate PL relations (and their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARSS gP1rP1iP1 bands for Galactic T2Ceps located in the vicinity of the Sun. We collected data for 16 T2Ceps of the BLHer type and 17 of the WVir type using 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We have calibrated PL and period-Wesenheit relations for Milky Way BLHer and WVir stars in the solar neighborhood, as well as for a combined sample of both types. The relationships derived here will allow to determine the distances to T2Ceps that will be discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time survey and, in turn, to probe the extended halo of the Milky Way, as well as the halos of nearby galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, the relations derived in this study are the first for Milky Way T2Ceps in the Sloan bands.</description>

      <title>Searching for Mass Concentrations with Precision Pulsar Timing</title>

Abstract: This papers searches for evidence of mass concentrations along the path of radio pulses in the IPTA survey data release. Radio pulse travel times are influenced via gravitational fields along the path from the source to the observer. Transient time delays in transit are a useful measure of the matter distribution along the path. Many pulsars have very well understood timing solutions with predicable arrival times and can be used to sample the mass variation. Changes in the source, observer and mass concentration positions produce changes in arrival times which can be significant for precision pulsar times. Nine candidates are reported from this search. After red noise reduction the number of candidates drops to two. When the epoch at the encounter times are removed the candidates vanish. Delayed and early event candidate s are found at about the same rate. There is no clear evidence for a signal of gravitational delays from this search.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: II. Observations of an Eta Carinae Analog at $z=2.37$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising $\sim10 - 25$ % of it, with magnifications in the range of $\approx600-25,000$ depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>

      <title>The warm-hot intergalactic medium in inter-cluster filaments -- A forecast for HUBS observations based on eRASS1 superclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations indicate that nearly half of the baryons in the nearby Universe are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase, and about a half them reside in cosmic filaments connecting galaxy clusters. Recent observational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy cluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excesses associated with optically identified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in filaments remain largely undetermined due to a lack of direct spectral diagnostics of individual targets, which are limited by the spectral resolution of current instruments in the soft X-ray band. We aim to select appropriate targets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV-level energy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a one-square-degree field of view, thus complementing other planned microcalorimetry missions such as Athena. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the eRASS1 supercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission. Their modeled emission and geometrical properties were used to select candidate targets for HUBS observations. Four inter-cluster filaments were selected as the most appropriate candidates. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we demonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas properties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the temperature constrained to $\pm0.01$ keV, metallicity constrained to $\leq\pm0.03$ solar, and density constrained to $&lt;\pm10\%$. Elemental abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing unprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas. We also show that direct mapping of the WHIM distribution is promising with narrowband imaging of the Oviii line.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies at High redshifts: Strong {\sc [Oiii]} Emission Lines Produced by Obscured AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at $z\sim 1$ with strong {\sc[Oiii]}$\lambda$5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of $2905^{+946}_{-578}$ \AA\ and $2000^{+188}_{-159}$ \AA, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large {\sc [Oiii]} EW ($2508^{+1487}_{-689}$ \AA) EELG found at $z\sim 2$ in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore for the physical origins of the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of AGN identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicating obscured AGN. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad H$\beta$ lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad-H$\beta$ to {\sc [Oiii]} lines are small, $\lesssim 0.15$ that are comparable with Seyfert $1.8-2.0$ galaxies. We conduct \texttt{Cloudy} modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large {\sc [Oiii]} EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGN, but obscured AGN that efficiently produces O$^{++}$ ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.</description>

      <title>Measuring the boson mass of fuzzy dark matter with stellar proper motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 &lt; z &lt; 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.</description>

Abstract: The study of dark matter substructure through strong gravitational lensing has shown enormous promise in probing the properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. This approach has already been used to place strong constraints on a wide range of dark matter models including self-interacting dark matter, fuzzy dark matter and warm dark matter. A major source of degeneracy exists between suppression of low mass halos due to novel dark matter physics and the strength of tidal stripping experienced by subhalos. We study theoretical predictions for the statistical properties of subhalos in strong gravitational lenses using the semi-analytic galaxy formation toolkit: galacticus. We present a large suite of dark matter only galacticus models, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in host halo mass (from Milky Way to group mass halos between redshifts from $0.2$ to $0.8$). Additionally, we include a smaller set of galacticus runs with the potential of a central massive elliptical to complement our dark matter only suite of models. We place particular focus on quantities relevant to strong gravitational lensing; namely the projected number density of substructure near the Einstein radius as function of host stellar mass and redshift. In the innermost region in projection, we find that our galacticus models agrees with N-body simulations within a factor of $\sim 2$ within the Einstein radius. We find that the addition of a central galaxy suppresses the projected number density of subhalos within in the Einstein radius by around $15\%$ relative to dark matter only simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.</description>

      <title>Gas excitation in galaxies and active galactic nuclei with He II{\lambda}4686 and X-ray emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of He II emission in galaxies remains a debated topic, requiring ionizing photons with energies exceeding 54 eV. While massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often fails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that X-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We explore the relationship between X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ emission in a statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray sources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary mechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We cross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra Source Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ detections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and AGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II galaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs generally exhibit higher He II/H$\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and harder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the H$\beta$ equivalent width ($\rm EW_{H\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\beta$ ratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\rm EW_{H\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary driver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the central black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV emission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He II require the presence of XRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the life cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the environment plays an important role. In particular, the over-dense environments of galaxy groups, where dynamical interactions and bulk motions have significant impact, offer an excellent but under-explored window into the life cycles of AGN and the processes that shape the evolution of relativistic plasma. Pilot Survey observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey recovered diffuse emission associated with the nearby (z = 0.0228) galaxy group HCG15, which was revealed to be strongly linearly polarised. We study the properties of this emission in unprecedented detail to settle open questions about its nature and its relation to the group-member galaxies. We perform a multi-frequency spectropolarimetric study of HCG15 incorporating our ASKAP EMU observations as well as new data from MeerKAT, LOFAR, the GMRT, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), plus X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical spectra from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Our study confirms that the diffuse structure represents remnant emission from historic AGN activity, likely associated with HCG15-D, some 80-86 Myr ago (based on ageing analysis). We detect significant highly linearly-polarised emission from a diffuse 'ridge'-like structure with a highly ordered magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that this emission is generated by draping of magnetic field lines in the intra-group medium (IGrM), although further exploration with simulations would aid our understanding. We confirm that HCG15-C is a group-member galaxy. Finally, we report the detection of thermal emission associated with a background cluster at redshift z ~ 0.87 projected onto the IGrM of HCG15, which matches the position and redshift of the recent SZ detection of ACT-CL J0207.8+0209.</description>

      <title>Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.</description>
