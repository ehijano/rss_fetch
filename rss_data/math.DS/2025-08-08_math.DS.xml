      <title>Gevrey KAM equilibria for quasi-periodic long-range Frenkel-Kontorova models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models of one-dimensional chains of non-nearest neighbor and many-body interacting particles subjected to quasi-periodic media. We extend the results in \cite{12Su&amp;delaLlavelongrange} from analytic to Gevrey regularity potentials. More precisely, we establish an a posteriori KAM theorem showing that in the Gevrey topology, given an approximate solution of equilibrium equation, which satisfies some appropriate non-degeneracy conditions and decay property, then there is a true solution nearby and the solution preserves both the quasi-periodicity and Gevrey regularity. The method of proof is based on a combination of quasi-Newton methods and delicate estimates in spaces of Gevrey functions.</description>

      <title>Paper-folding models for the CAR algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the CAR algebra admits a Cantor spectrum C*-diagonal that is not conjugate to the standard AF diagonal. We obtain this by classification theory of C*-algebras, and the diagonal arises by realising the CAR algebra as the crossed product of a free minimal action on the Cantor space, where the acting group is the product of a locally finite group with the infinite dihedral group. The main ingredient in the construction is a binary subshift associated to the well-known regular paper-folding sequence.
  Moreover, we show that the CAR algebra in fact admits countably many, pairwise non-conjugate, Cantor spectrum diagonals which are distinguished by the different values of their diagonal dimension, as defined by Li, Liao and the second named author.</description>

      <title>Exploring epidemic control policies using nonlinear programming and mathematical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory in epidemiology has been used to establish the most effective intervention strategies for managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases while considering constraints and costs. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, indirect methods provide necessary optimality conditions by transforming the control problem into a two-point boundary value problem. However, these approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and can be computationally challenging, especially when dealing with complex constraints. In contrast, direct methods, which discretise the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation, could offer robust, adaptable solutions for real-time decision-making. Despite their potential, the widespread adoption of these techniques has been limited, which may be due to restricted access to specialised software, perceived high costs, or unfamiliarity with these methods. This study investigates the feasibility, robustness, and potential of direct optimal control methods using nonlinear programming solvers on compartmental models described by ordinary differential equations to determine the best application of various interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination strategies. Through case studies, we demonstrate the use of NLP solvers to determine the optimal application of interventions based on single objectives, such as minimising total infections, "flattening the curve", or reducing peak infection levels, as well as multi-objective optimisation to achieve the best combination of interventions. While indirect methods provide useful theoretical insights, direct approaches may be a better fit for the fast-evolving challenges of real-world epidemiology.</description>

      <title>An SIRS model with hospitalizations: economic impact by disease severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-timescale SIRS-type model in which a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals experiences a severe course of the disease, requiring hospitalization. During hospitalization, these individuals do not contribute to further infections. We analyze the model's equilibria, perform a bifurcation analysis, and explore its two-timescale nature (using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory). Our main result provides an explicit expression for the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the total number of hospitalized individuals for long times, revealing that this fraction can be lower than 1. This highlights the interesting effect that a severe disease, by necessitating widespread hospitalization, can indirectly suppress contagions and, consequently, reduce hospitalizations. Numerical simulations illustrate the growth in the number of hospitalizations for short times. The model can also be interpreted as a scenario where only a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals develops symptoms and self-quarantines.</description>

      <title>The problem of infinite Spin for parabolic and collision solutions in the planar $n$-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the planar $n$-body problem, the problem of infinite spin occurs for both parabolic and collision solutions. Recently Moeckel and Montgomery \cite{MM25} showed that there is no infinite spin for total collision solutions, when the reduced and normalized configuration converges to an isolated central configuration. Following their approach, we show it can not happen for both complete and partially parabolic solutions, under similar conditions. Our approach also allows us to generalize Moeckel and Montgomery's result to partial collision solutions under similar conditions.</description>
