      <title>Pretrained-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models for Microbiome Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that human cancers are intricately linked to human microbiomes, forming an inseparable connection. However, due to limited sample sizes and significant data loss during collection for various reasons, some machine learning methods have been proposed to address the issue of missing data. These methods have not fully utilized the known clinical information of patients to enhance the accuracy of data imputation. Therefore, we introduce mbVDiT, a novel pre-trained conditional diffusion model for microbiome data imputation and denoising, which uses the unmasked data and patient metadata as conditional guidance for imputating missing values. It is also uses VAE to integrate the the other public microbiome datasets to enhance model performance. The results on the microbiome datasets from three different cancer types demonstrate the performance of our methods in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.
