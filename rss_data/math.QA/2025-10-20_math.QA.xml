      <title>A cohomology theory of supercommutative algebras and grading-restricted vertex superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs the cohomology theory for grading-restricted vertex superalgebras, generalizing Yi-Zhi Huang's cohomology theory of grading-restricted vertex algebras. To simplify the discussion, motivate the construction, and make it easier for the reader to understand the technical points, we also include the construction of the cohomology theory of supercommutative associative algebras, a generalization of the Harrison cohomology theory of a commutative algebra that has not been explicitly written down. The paper will serve as the foundation for many subsequent studies, especially, the deformation theory of vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Based morphisms for characters of quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study based one-dimensional modules of quantum symmetric pairs over the field $\Q(q)$. We provide a complete classification of one-dimensional $\uqb$-modules that appear as submodules of simple finite-dimensional based $\uq$-modules and determine the corresponding branching rules. The main result of this paper shows that the corresponding projections are morphisms of based $\uqb$-modules. To this end we characterize one-dimensional modules at $q=\infty$, thus developing a $\imath$crystal basis theory for these modules.
  This is then applied to show compatibility with the integral forms of the (dual-)canonical basis.</description>

      <title>Wild genus-zero quantum de Rham spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wild de Rham spaces parameterize isomorphism classes of (stable) meromorphic connections, defined on principal bundles over wild Riemann surfaces. Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear partial differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general (possibly nongeneric) untwisted/unramified case with semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group, but without using parabolic/parahoric structure. The main ingredients are: i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat.</description>

      <title>On amplified graph $C^*$-algebras as cores of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph $R$, we construct from it two graphs $E_R$ and $F_R$, one by adding a loop at every vertex of $R$ and one by replacing every arrow of $R$ by countably infinitely many arrows. We show that the graph C*-algebra $C^*(F_R)$ is isomorphic to the AF core of $C^*(E_R)$. Examples include C*-algebras of a quantum flag manifolds. We discuss in details the quantum Grassmannian $Gr_q(2,4)$ and use our description as AF core to derive a CW-type decomposition.</description>

      <title>Hopf BiGalois Theory for Hopf Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of $q,t$-matrix models and quantum toroidal algebra recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $q,t$-deformed matrix models give rise to representations of the deformed Virasoro algebra and more generally of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. These representations are described in terms of finite difference equations that induce recursion relations for correlation functions. Under suitable assumptions, these recursions admit unique solutions expressible through "superintegrability" formulas, i.e. explicit closed formulas for averages of Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, we discuss examples arising from localization of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, which include $q,t$-deformation of well known classical ensembles: Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi. We explain how relations in the quantum toroidal algebra can be used to give a new and universal proof of the known superintegrability formulas, as well as to derive new formulas for models that have not been previously studied in the literature. Finally, we make some remarks regarding the relation between superintegrability and orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebras in Grothendieck-Verdier categories, rigidity, and vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</description>

      <title>On the colored Links--Gould polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a cabling formula for the Links--Gould polynomial of knots colored with a $4n$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathrm{U}^H_q\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ and identify them with the $V_n$-polynomial of knots for $n=2$. Using the cabling formula, we obtain genus bounds and a specialization to the Alexander polynomial for the colored Links--Gould polynomial that is independent of $n$, which implies corresponding properties of the $V_n$-polynomial for $n=2$ conjectured in previous work of two of the authors, and extends the work done for $n=1$. Combined with work of one of the authors arXiv:2409.03557, our genus bound for $\mathrm{LG}^{(2)}=V_2$ is sharp for all knots with up to $16$ crossings.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Constructing solutions of simplex equations from polygon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study polygon equations and their connections to simplex equations, which generalize the pentagon and Yang--Baxter equations, respectively. First, we show that certain "commutative" pairs of solutions of (dual) polygon equations give rise to solutions of higher polygon equations. Next, we define an explicit compatibility condition between solutions of the $n$-gon and dual $n$-gon equations and use it to construct solutions of the $(n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-simplex equations. This extends earlier work by Kashaev--Sergeev and Dimakis--M\"uller-Hoissen.</description>
