      <title>On Carath\'eodory approximate scheme for a class of one-dimensional doubly perturbed diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the convergence of new Carath\'eodory's approximate solution for one-dimensional $\alpha, \beta$-doubly perturbed stochastic differential equations (DPSDEs) with parameters $\alpha &lt;1$ and $\beta &lt;1$ such that $|\rho| &lt; 1$, where $ \rho : = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(1-\alpha)(1-\beta)}$. Under Lipschitz's condition on the coefficients, we establish the $L^{p}$-convergence of the Carath\'eodory approximate solution uniformly in time, for all $p\geq 2$. As a consequence, and relying only on our scheme, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of strong solution for $\alpha, \beta$-DPSDEs. Furthermore, an extension to non-Lipschitz coefficients are also studied. Our results improve earlier work by Mao and al. (2018).</description>

      <title>A stochastic process defined via the random permutation divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normalised partial sums of values of a nonnegative multiplicative function over divisors with appropriately restricted sizes of a random permutation from the symmetric group define trajectories of a stochastic process. We prove a functional limit theorem in the Skorokhod space when the permutations are drawn uniformly at random. Furthermore, we show that the paths of the limit process almost surely belong to the space of continuous functions on the unit interval and, exploiting the results from number-theoretical papers, we obtain rather complex formulas for the limits of joint power moments of the process.</description>

      <title>Rates of memory loss for null recurrent Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orey (1962) proved that for an irreducible, aperiodic, and recurrent Markov chain with transition operator $P$, the sequence $P^n (\mu - \nu)$ converges to zero in total variation for any two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. In other words, all such Markov chains exhibit memory loss. While the rates of memory loss have been extensively studied for positive recurrent chains, there is a surprising lack of results for null recurrent chains. In this work, we prove the first estimates of memory loss rates in the null recurrent case.</description>

      <title>Zeros and Critical Points of Gaussian Fields: Cumulants Asymptotics and Limit Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^k$ be a smooth centered stationary Gaussian field and $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a compact set. In this paper, we determine the asymptotics as $n \to \infty$ of all the cumulants of the $(d-k)$-dimensional volume of $f^{-1}(0) \cap nK$. When $k=1$, we obtain similar asymptotics for the number of critical points of $f$ in $nK$. Our main hypotheses are some regularity and non-degeneracy of the field, as well as mild integrability conditions on the first derivatives of its covariance kernel. As corollaries of these cumulants estimates, we deduce a strong Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the nodal volume (resp.~the number of critical points) of a smooth non-degenerate field whose covariance kernel admits square integrable derivatives at any order. Our results hold more generally for a one-parameter family $(f_n)$ of Gaussian fields admitting a stationary local scaling limit as $n \to \infty$, for example Kostlan polynomials in the large degree limit.</description>

      <title>Strong law of large numbers for a branching random walk among Bernoulli traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $d$-dimensional branching random walk (BRW) in an i.i.d. random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in discrete time. A Bernoulli trap field is attached to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where each site, independently of the others, is a trap with a fixed probability. The interaction between the BRW and the trap field is given by the hard killing rule. Given a realization of the environment, over each time step, each particle first moves according to a simple symmetric random walk to a nearest neighbor, and immediately afterwards, splits into two particles if the new site is not a trap or is killed instantly if the new site is a trap. Conditional on the ultimate survival of the BRW, we prove a strong law of large numbers for the total mass of the process. Our result is quenched, that is, it holds in almost every environment in which the starting point of the BRW is inside the infinite connected component of trap-free sites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the global existence of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise and with initial data in $H^{1/2}(\mathbb{T}^{3})$. We prove that the solution exists globally in time with probability arbitrarily close to~$1$ if the initial data and noise are sufficiently small. If the noise is not assumed to be small, then the solution is global on a sufficiently small deterministic time interval with probability arbitrarily close to~$1$.</description>

      <title>BN-Pool: a Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Graph Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BN-Pool, the first clustering-based pooling method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that adaptively determines the number of supernodes in a coarsened graph. By leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric framework, BN-Pool employs a generative model capable of partitioning graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters. During training, we learn the node-to-cluster assignments by combining the supervised loss of the downstream task with an unsupervised auxiliary term, which encourages the reconstruction of the original graph topology while penalizing unnecessary proliferation of clusters. This adaptive strategy allows BN-Pool to automatically discover an optimal coarsening level, offering enhanced flexibility and removing the need to specify sensitive pooling ratios. We show that BN-Pool achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the local well-posedness of fractionally dissipated primitive equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional fractionally dissipated primitive equations with transport noise, focusing on subcritical and critical dissipation regimes characterized by $ (-\Delta)^{s/2} $ with $ s \in (1,2)$ and $s = 1$, respectively. For $\sigma&gt;3$, we establish the local existence of unique pathwise solutions in Sobolev space $H^\sigma$. This result applies to arbitrary initial data in the subcritical case ($s \in(1,2)$), and to small initial data in the critical case ($s=1$). The analysis is particularly challenging due to the loss of horizontal derivatives in the nonlinear terms and the lack of full dissipation. To address these challenges, we develop novel commutator estimates involving the hydrostatic Leray projection.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s' problems about unimodularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Letting $\delta_1(n,m)$ be the density of the set of integers with exactly one divisor in $(n,m)$, Erd\H{o}s wondered if $\delta_1(n,m)$ is unimodular for fixed $n$.
  We prove this is false in general, as the sequence $(\delta_1(n,m))$ has superpolynomially many local extrema. However, we confirm unimodality in the single case for which it occurs; $n = 1$.
  We also solve the question on unimodality of the density of integers whose $k^{th}$ prime is $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study zero-noise limits of $\alpha -$stable noise perturbed ODE's which are driven by an irregular vector field $A$ with asymptotics $% A(x)\sim \overline{a}(\frac{x}{\left\vert x\right\vert })\left\vert x\right\vert ^{\beta -1}x$ at zero, where $\overline{a}&gt;0$ is a continuous function and $\beta \in (0,1)$. The results established in this article can be considered a generalization of those in the seminal works of Bafico \cite{Ba} and Bafico, Baldi \cite{BB} to the multi-dimensional case. Our approach for proving these results is inspired by techniques in \cite% {PP_self_similar} and based on the analysis of an SDE for $t\longrightarrow \infty $, which is obtained through a transformation of the perturbed ODE.</description>

Abstract: By developing a new technique called the bi-coupling argument, we estimate the relative entropy between different diffusion processes in terms of the distances of initial distributions and drift-diffusion coefficients. As an application, the entropy-cost inequality is established for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with spatial-distribution dependent noise, which is open for a long time and has potential applications in optimal transport, information theory and mean field particle systems.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, Topology, and Convexity of Recurrence in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the two-dimensional positive quadrant $\mathbb{N}^2$ and the one-dimensional slab $\{0,1,\dots,k\}\times\mathbb{N}$. In the 1960's the following question was asked for $\mathbb{N}^2$: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show, via a coupling argument, that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive. In addition, we show using the Rayleigh monotonicity principle that the analogous question for random walks on trees is positive.
  These results show that the subset of parameter space that yields recurrent random walks possesses some geometric properties, in this case the structure of an order ideal. Motivated by this perspective, we consider the more symmetric setting of homogeneous random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, and ask when this subset possesses other geometric properties, namely various topological properties and convexity. We answer some of these questions: in particular, we show that this subset is closed, and under a symmetric support condition, show it is path-connected and additionally show it is convex if and only if its effective dimension is at most 2. We also show its complement is in some sense typically path-connected but not convex. We finally propose some related open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic PDE:
  $\partial_tu(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta u(t,x)+{\beta}{}u(t,x)V(t,x),$
  in dimension $d=2$, where the potential V is the space and time mollification of the two-dimensional space-time white noise. We show that after renormalizing, the fluctuations of the solution converge to the Edwards-Wilkinson limit with an explicit effective variance and constant effective diffusivity. Our main tool is a Markov chain on the space of paths which we use to establish an extension of the Kallianpur-Robbins law to a specific regenerative process.</description>

      <title>Duality for some models of epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of boundaries and the structure of nontrivial duality functions for three non conservative interacting particle systems in one dimension that model epidemic spreading: (i) the diffusive contact process (DCP), (ii) a  model that we introduce and call generalized diffusive contact process (GDCP), both in finite volume in contact with boundary reservoirs, i.e., with open boundaries, and (iii) the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on $\Z$. We establish duality relations for each system through an analytical approach. It turns out that with open boundaries self-duality breaks down and qualitatively different properties compared to closed boundaries (i.e., finite volume without reservoirs) arise: both the DCP and GDCP are ergodic but no longer absorbing, while the respective dual processes are absorbing but not ergodic. We provide expressions for the stationary correlation functions in terms of the dual absorption probabilities. We perform explicit computations for a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. The duality function is factorized for the DCP and GDCP, contrary to the SIR model for which the duality relation is nonlocal and yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of clusters of susceptible individuals.</description>

      <title>On independence and large deviations for sublinear expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove by counterexample that a large deviation principle established by Chen and Feng [{\em Comm. Statist. Theory Methods} {\bf 45} (2016), 400--412] in the framework of sublinear expectations is incorrect. That implies that the rate function cannot, in general, be obtained by computing the Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function, as is the case for ordinary probabilities. We derive a corrected version of that result and show that the original presentation holds under a stronger independence assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectral Criteria for the Asymptotics of Local Functionals of Gaussian Fields and Their Application to Nodal Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general criterion for the positivity of the variance of the second chaotic component of local functionals of stationary vector-valued Gaussian fields. This criterion is formulated in terms of the spectral properties of the covariance function, without requiring assumptions of integrability or isotropy. It offers a simple and robust framework for analyzing variance asymptotics in such models. We apply this approach to the study of the nodal volume and the number of critical points of a Gaussian field, proving the positivity of the limiting variance under mild conditions on the covariance function. Additionally, we examine the asymptotics of the particular model of Euclidean random waves, deriving the central limit theorem through an analysis of the second and fourth chaotic components, thereby resolving an open question in large dimensions. As a byproduct, we condense and generalize many existing results on the volume of intersections of random waves, bypassing the need for traditional, intricate variance computations. Our findings shed new light on the second-chaos cancellation phenomenon from a spectral perspective and can be extended to any local, possibly singular, functional of Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Subgraphs in Randomly Colored Dense Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a sequence of graphs $G_n$ and a fixed graph $H$, denote by $T(H, G_n)$ the number of monochromatic copies of the graph $H$ in a uniformly random $c$-coloring of the vertices of $G_n$. In this paper we study the joint distribution of a finite collection of monochromatic graph counts in networks with multiple layers (multiplex networks). Specifically, given a finite collection of graphs $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_d$ we derive the joint distribution of $(T(H_1, G_n^{(1)}), T(H_2, G_n^{(2)}), \ldots, T(H_d, G_n^{(d)}))$, where $\boldsymbol{G}_n = (G_n^{(1)}, G_n^{(2)}, \ldots, G_n^{(d)})$ is a collection of dense graphs on the same vertex set converging in the joint cut-metric. The limiting distribution is the sum of 2 independent components: a multivariate Gaussian and a sum of independent bivariate stochastic integrals. This extends previous results on the marginal convergence of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of graphs to the joint convergence of a finite collection of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of multiplex networks. Several applications and examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Random eigenvalues of graphenes and the triangulation of plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the numbers of closed paths of length $k\in\mathbb{N}$ on two important regular lattices: the hexagonal lattice (also called $\textit{graphene}$ in chemistry) and its dual triangular lattice. These numbers form a moment sequence of specific random variables connected to the distance of a position of a planar random flight (in three steps) from the origin. Here, we refer to such a random variable as a $\textit{random eigenvalue}$ of the underlying lattice. Explicit formulas for the probability density and characteristic functions of these random eigenvalues are given for both the hexagonal and the triangular lattice. Furthermore, it is proven that both probability distributions can be approximated by a functional of the random variable uniformly distributed on increasing intervals $[0,b]$ as $b\to\infty$. This yields a straightforward method to simulate these random eigenvalues without generating graphene and triangular lattice graphs. To demonstrate this approximation, we first prove a key integral identity for a specific series containing the third powers of the modified Bessel functions $I_n$ of $n$th order, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Such series play a crucial role in various contexts, in particular, in analysis, combinatorics, and theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Hardy--Stein identity for vector functions in $L^p(\mathbb R^d;\mathbb R^n)$ with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and for the canonical paring of two real functions in $L^p(\mathbb R^d)$ with $2\le p&lt;\infty$. To this end we propose a notion of Bregman co-divergence and study the corresponding integral forms.</description>

      <title>Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</description>

      <title>Tree-structured Markov random fields with Poisson marginal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new family of tree-structured Markov random fields for a vector of discrete counting random variables is introduced. According to the characteristics of the family, the marginal distributions of the Markov random fields are all Poisson with the same mean, and are untied from the strength or structure of their built-in dependence. This key feature is uncommon for Markov random fields and most convenient for applications purposes. The specific properties of this new family confer a straightforward sampling procedure and analytic expressions for the joint probability mass function and the joint probability generating function of the vector of counting random variables, thus granting computational methods that scale well to vectors of high dimension. We study the distribution of the sum of random variables constituting a Markov random field from the proposed family, analyze a random variable's individual contribution to that sum through expected allocations, and establish stochastic orderings to assess a wide understanding of their behavior.</description>

      <title>A convergent scheme for the Bayesian filtering problem based on the Fokker--Planck equation and deep splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical scheme for approximating the nonlinear filtering density is introduced and its convergence rate is established, theoretically under a parabolic H\"ormander condition, and empirically in two numerical examples. For the prediction step, between the noisy and partial measurements at discrete times, the scheme approximates the Fokker--Planck equation with a deep splitting scheme, combined with an exact update through Bayes' formula. This results in a classical prediction-update filtering algorithm that operates online for new observation sequences post-training. The algorithm employs a sampling-based Feynman--Kac approach, designed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. The convergence proof relies on stochastic integration by parts from the Malliavin calculus. As a corollary we obtain the convergence rate for the approximation of the Fokker--Planck equation alone, disconnected from the filtering problem.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>
