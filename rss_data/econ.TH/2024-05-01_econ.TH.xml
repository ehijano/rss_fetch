      <title>Persuasion in Networks: Can the Sender Do Better than Using Public Signals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political and advertising campaigns increasingly exploit social networks to spread information and persuade people. This paper studies a persuasion model to examine whether such a strategy is better than simply sending public signals. Receivers in the model have heterogeneous priors and will pass on a signal if they are persuaded by it. I show that a risk neutral or risk loving sender prefers to use public signals, unless more sceptical receivers are sufficiently more connected in the social network. A risk averse sender may prefer to exploit the network. These results still hold when networks exhibit homophily.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Exploration from Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from Robbins (1952), the literature on experimentation via multi-armed bandits has wed exploration and exploitation. Nonetheless, in many applications, agents' exploration and exploitation need not be intertwined: a policymaker may assess new policies different than the status quo; an investor may evaluate projects outside her portfolio. We characterize the optimal experimentation policy when exploration and exploitation are disentangled in the case of Poisson bandits, allowing for general news structures. The optimal policy features complete learning asymptotically, exhibits lots of persistence, but cannot be identified by an index a la Gittins. Disentanglement is particularly valuable for intermediate parameter values.</description>

      <title>Level-$k$ Reasoning, Cognitive Hierarchy, and Rationalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a uniform framework to cognitive hierarchy (CH) solution concepts a decision-theoretical foundation by the epistemic game theoretical solution concept $\Delta$-rationalizability (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2003). We formulate level-$k$ strategic sophistication as an information type, and, by putting intuitive conditions on the the belief of players with a strategic sophistication, we define a restriction $\Delta^\kappa$, from which the levels of reasoning is endogenously determined. We show that in static games, Camerer, Ho, and Chong's (2004) CH solution generically coincides with the behavioral consequence of rationality, common belief in rationality, and transparency of $\Delta^\kappa$; based on this, we connect CH with Bayesian equilibrium. By adapting $\Delta^\kappa$ into dynamic games, we show that Lin and Palfrey's (2024) DCH solution generically coincides with the behavioral consequence of rationality, common strong belief in rationality, and transparency of (dynamic) $\Delta^\kappa$. The same structure could analyze many variations of CH in the literature.</description>

      <title>Almost Envy-Freeness under Weakly Lexicographic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fair division of indivisible items, domain restriction has played a key role in escaping from negative results and providing structural insights into the computational and axiomatic boundaries of fairness. One notable subdomain of additive preferences, the lexicographic domain, has yielded several positive results in dealing with goods, chores, and mixtures thereof. However, the majority of work within this domain primarily consider strict linear orders over items, which do not allow the modeling of more expressive preferences that contain indifferences (ties). We investigate the most prominent fairness notions of envy-freeness up to any (EFX) or some (EF1) item under weakly lexicographic preferences. For the goods-only setting, we develop an algorithm that can be customized to guarantee EF1, EFX, maximin share (MMS), or a combination thereof, along the efficiency notion of Pareto optimality (PO). From the conceptual perspective, we propose techniques such as preference graphs and potential envy that are independently of interest when dealing with ties. Finally, we demonstrate challenges in dealing with chores and highlight key algorithmic and axiomatic differences of finding EFX solutions with the goods-only setting. Nevertheless, we show that there is an algorithm that always returns an EF1 and PO allocation for the chores-only instances.</description>

      <title>Sequential unanimity voting rules for binary social choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a group of voters that needs to decide between two candidates. We propose a novel family of neutral and strategy-proof rules, which we call sequential unanimity rules. By demonstrating their formal equivalence to the M-winning coalition rules of Moulin (1983), we show that sequential unanimity rules are characterized by neutrality and strategy-proofness. We establish our results by developing algorithms that transform a given M-winning coalition rule into an equivalent sequential unanimity rule and vice versa. The analysis can be extended to accommodate the full preference domain in which voters may be indifferent between candidates.</description>
