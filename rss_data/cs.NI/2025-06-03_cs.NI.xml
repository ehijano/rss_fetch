      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Based Telematic Routing Protocol for the Internet of Underwater Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio, buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.</description>

      <title>Cyrus+: A DRL-based Puncturing Solution to URLLC/eMBB Multiplexing in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puncturing is a promising technique in 3GPP to multiplex Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) traffic on the same 5G New Radio (NR) air interface. The essence of puncturing is to transmit URLLC packets on demand upon their arrival, by preempting the radio resources (or subcarriers) that are already allocated to eMBB traffic. Although it is considered most bandwidth efficient, puncturing URLLC data on eMBB can lead to degradation of eMBB's performance. Most of the state-of-the-art research addressing this problem employ raw eMBB data throughput as performance metric. This is inadequate as, after puncturing, eMBB data may or may not be successfully decoded at its receiver. This paper presents Cyrus+, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based puncturing solution that employs goodput (through feedback from a receiver's decoder), rather than estimated raw throughput, in its design of reward function. Further, Cyrus+ is tailored specifically for the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture and fully leverages O-RAN's three control loops at different time scales in its design of DRL. In the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Cyrus+ initializes the policy network that will be used in the RT Open Distributed Unit (O-DU). In the Near-RT RIC, Cyrus+ refines the policy based on dynamic network conditions and feedback from the receivers. In the RT O-DU, Cyrus+ generates a puncturing codebook by considering all possible URLLC arrivals. We build a standard-compliant link-level 5G NR simulator to demonstrate the efficacy of Cyrus+. Experimental results show that Cyrus+ outperforms benchmark puncturing algorithms and meets the stringent timing requirement in 5G NR (numerology 3).</description>

      <title>Direct-to-Cell: A First Look into Starlink's Direct Satellite-to-Device Radio Access Network through Crowdsourced Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 24 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Wireless Powered Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a novel wireless powered communication network (WPCN) enabled by a pinching-antenna system (PASS), in which multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are activated on a waveguide to establish strong line-of-sight (LoS) links with multiple devices. In this system, time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are adopted to fully explore the potential of the wireless information transmission. To maximize the sum rate of the PASS-WPCN, we formulate the problems under both protocols by jointly optimizing the time slot allocation, transmit powers of the devices, and activation positions of the PAs. Firstly, the intractable non-convex original problems are both decoupled into two tractable subproblems, termed resource allocation and PAs position optimization. Specifically, a closed-form solution to the resource allocation subproblem is derived, and it is proven that the TDMA and NOMA protocols achieve identical maximum sum rate. Then, an element-wise algorithm is developed to obtain high-precision PAs activation positions. Numerical results reveal that 1) the performance of PASS-WPCNs significantly outperforms conventional WPCNs, and 2) in PASS-WPCNs, TDMA and NOMA protocols exhibit identical achievable sum rate performance.</description>

      <title>RAIL: An Accurate and Fast Angle-inferred Localization Algorithm for UAV-WSN Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location information is a fundamental requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, accurately and efficiently localizing sensor nodes with diverse functionalities remains a significant challenge, particularly in a hardware-constrained environment. To address this issue and enhance the applicability of artificial intelligence (AI), this paper proposes a localization algorithm that does not require additional hardware. Specifically, the angle between a node and the anchor nodes is estimated based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI). A subsequent localization strategy leverages the inferred angular relationships in conjunction with a bounding box. Experimental evaluations in three scenarios with varying number of nodes demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in localization accuracy, reducing the average error by 72.4% compared to the Min-Max and RSSI-based DV-Hop algorithms, respectively.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven O-RAN for Automatic Multirobot Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Industry 4.0 has led to the emergence of smart factories, where multirobot system autonomously operates to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and improve system adaptability. However, maintaining reliable and efficient network operations in these dynamic and complex environments requires advanced automation mechanisms. This study presents a zero-touch network platform that integrates a hierarchical Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, enabling the seamless incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms and dynamic management of communication and computational resources, while ensuring uninterrupted connectivity with multirobot system. Leveraging this adaptability, the platform utilizes federated deep reinforcement learning (FedDRL) to enable distributed decision-making across multiple learning agents, facilitating the adaptive parameter reconfiguration of transmitters (i.e., multirobot system) to optimize long-term system throughput and transmission energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that within the proposed O-RAN-enabled zero-touch network platform, FedDRL achieves a 12% increase in system throughput, a 32% improvement in normalized average transmission energy efficiency, and a 28% reduction in average transmission energy consumption compared to baseline methods such as independent DRL.</description>

      <title>S\"{o}ze: One Network Telemetry Is All You Need for Per-flow Weighted Bandwidth Allocation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted bandwidth allocation is a powerful abstraction that has a wide range of use cases in modern data center networks. However, realizing highly agile and precise weighted bandwidth allocation for large-scale cloud environments is fundamentally challenging. In this paper, we propose S\"{o}ze, a lightweight decentralized weighted bandwidth allocation system that leverages simple network telemetry features of commodity Ethernet switches. Given the flow weights, S\"{o}ze can effectively use the telemetry information to compute and enforce the weighted bandwidth allocations without per-flow, topology, or routing knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of S\"{o}ze through simulations and testbed experiments, improving TPC-H jobs completion time by up to $0.59\times$ and $0.79\times$ on average.</description>

      <title>Bridging Subjective and Objective QoE: Operator-Level Aggregation Using LLM-Based Comment Analysis and Network MOS Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</description>

      <title>Network Digital Twin for 6G and Beyond: An End-to-End View Across Multi-Domain Network Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of technology, the number of smart mobile users is increasing, accompanied by growing demands from applications such as virtual/augmented reality (VR/XR), remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, and real-time holographic communications, all of which require high transmission rates and ultra-low latency in 6G and beyond networks (6G+). This poses enormous challenges in efficiently deploying large-scale networks, including network design, planning, troubleshooting, optimization, and maintenance, without affecting the user experience. Network Digital Twin (NDT) has emerged as a potential solution, enabling the creation of a virtual model that reflects the actual network, supporting the simulation of various network designs, applying diverse operating policies, and reproducing complex fault scenarios under real-world conditions. This motivate us for this study, where we provide a comprehensive survey of NDT in the context of 6G+, covering areas such as radio access networks (RAN), transport networks, 5G core networks and beyond (5GCORE+), cloud/edge computing, applications (blockchain, health system, manufacturing, security, and vehicular networks), non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), and quantum networks, from both academic and industrial perspectives. In particular, we are the first to provide an in-depth guide and usage of RAN and 5GCORE+ for NDT. Then, we provide an extensive review of foundation technologies such as transport networks, cloud/edge computing, applications, NTNs, and quantum networks in NDT. Finally, we discuss the key challenges, open issues, and future research directions for NDT in the context of 6G+.</description>

      <title>$\text{TREX}^2$: Dual-Reconstruction Framework for Teleoperated-Robot with EXtended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot teleoperation with extended reality (XR teleoperation) enables intuitive interaction by allowing remote robots to mimic user motions with real-time 3D feedback. However, existing systems face significant motion-to-motion (M2M) latency -- the delay between the user's latest motion and the corresponding robot feedback -- leading to high teleoperation error and mission completion time. This issue stems from the system's exclusive reliance on network communication, making it highly vulnerable to network degradation. To address these challenges, we introduce $\text{TREX}^2$, the first end-to-end, fully open-sourced XR teleoperation framework that decouples robot control and XR visualization from network dependencies. $\text{TREX}^2$ leverages local sensing data to reconstruct delayed or missing information of the counterpart, thereby significantly reducing network-induced issues. This approach allows both the XR and robot to run concurrently with network transmission while maintaining high robot planning accuracy. $\text{TREX}^2$ also features contention-aware scheduling to mitigate GPU contention and bandwidth-adaptive point cloud scaling to cope with limited bandwidth. We implement $\text{TREX}^2$ across three hardware settings, including simulated and physical robots, and evaluate it on 9,500 real-world teleoperation trials from the RoboSet dataset \cite{kumar2024robohive}, covering single- and multi-step missions. Compared to state-of-the-art XR teleoperation frameworks, $\text{TREX}^2$ reduces teleoperation error by up to 69.8% on WLAN and 73.1% on cellular networks with only 6.7% maximum runtime overhead. It also improves completion time by up to 47.7%, enabling smoother teleoperation. A real-world case study on ten stationary and mobile missions further shows $\text{TREX}^2$ achieves up to 37.7% faster completion while lowering average teleoperation error by up to 57.2%.</description>

      <title>Combining Different Existing Methods for Describing Steganography Hiding Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of digital carriers that can be exploited to conceal arbitrary data has greatly increased the number of techniques for implementing network steganography. As a result, the literature overlaps greatly in terms of concepts and terminology. Moreover, from a cybersecurity viewpoint, the same hiding mechanism may be perceived differently, making harder the development of a unique defensive strategy or the definition of practices to mitigate risks arising from the use of steganography. To mitigate these drawbacks, several researchers introduced approaches that aid in the unified description of steganography methods and network covert channels.
  Understanding and combining all descriptive methods for steganography techniques is a challenging but important task. For instance, researchers might want to explain how malware applies a certain steganography technique or categorize a novel hiding approach. Consequently, this paper aims to provide an introduction to the concept of descriptive methods for steganography. The paper is organized in the form of a tutorial, with the main goal of explaining how existing descriptions and taxonomy objects can be combined to achieve a detailed categorization and description of hiding methods. To show how this can effectively help the research community, the paper also contains various real-world examples.</description>

      <title>WakeMod: A 6.9uW Wake-Up Radio Module with -72.6dBm Sensitivity for On-Demand IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as asset tracking and remote sensing, demand multi-year battery lifetimes to minimize maintenance and operational costs. Traditional wireless protocols often employ duty cycling, introducing a tradeoff between latency and idle consumption - both unsuitable for event-driven and ultra-low power systems. A promising approach to address these issues is the integration of always-on wake-up radios (WuRs). They provide asynchronous, ultra-low power communication to overcome these constraints.
  This paper presents WakeMod, an open-source wake-up transceiver module for the 868MHz ISM band. Designed for easy integration and ultra-low power consumption, it leverages the -75dBm sensitive FH101RF WuR. WakeMod achieves a low idle power consumption of 6.9uW while maintaining responsiveness with a sensitivity of -72.6dBm. Reception of a wake-up call is possible from up to 130m of distance with a -2.1dBi antenna, consuming 17.7uJ with a latency below 54.3ms. WakeMod's capabilities have further been demonstrated in an e-ink price tag application, achieving 7.17uW idle consumption and enabling an estimated 8-year battery life with daily updates on a standard CR2032 coin cell. WakeMod offers a practical solution for energy-constrained, long-term IoT deployments, requiring low-latency, and on-demand communication.</description>
