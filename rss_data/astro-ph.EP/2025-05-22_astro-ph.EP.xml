      <title>Geodetic Exploration of the Interior Structure of Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of sustainable habitability requires characterizing the interior properties, and in particular, the extent and distribution of the tidal heating. The intensity of any inferred geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for understanding the hydrothermal activity and the budget of biologically useful species. We build a statistical framework using an MCMC approach to constrain the interior based on currently available observations of libration, shape, heat budget, and mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can constrain the interior structure, with an emphasis on determining the partitioning of tidal dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational and displacement tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring the amplitude and phase of $k_2$ alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, without a sensitivity to the distribution of heat. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of $h_2$ or $l_2$ facilitates determination of the shell rheology. We provide the precisions required for measuring $k_2$, $h_2$, and/or $l_2$ that enable distinguishing between the two main scenarios of tidal heating, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also investigate the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of a suite of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to instantaneous and sustained habitability at Enceladus.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Water reservoirs of compact planet-forming dust disk: A diversity of H$_2$O distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimetre-compact dust disks are thought to have efficient radial drift of icy dust pebbles, which has been hypothesised to produce an enhanced cold ($T&lt;$400 K) H$_2$O reservoir in their inner disks. Mid-infrared spectral surveys, now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), pave the way to explore this hypothesis. In this work, we test this theory for 8 compact disks ($R_\mathrm{dust}&lt;$60 au) with JWST-MIRI/MRS observations. We analyse the different reservoirs that can be probed with the pure rotational lines ($&gt;$10 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) through parametric column density profiles, multiple component slab models, and line flux ratios. We find that not all compact disks show strong enhancements of the cold H$_2$O reservoir, instead we propose three different classes of inner disk H$_2$O distributions. Four of our disks appear to have similar H$_2$O distributions as many of the large and structured disks (Type N or ``Normal'' disks), as is indicated by the slab model fitting and the line flux ratios. These disks have a small cold reservoir, suggesting the inward drift of dust, but it is not as efficient as hypothesised before. Only two disks do show a strong enhancement of the cold H$_2$O emission (Type E or cold H$_2$O enhanced disks), agreeing with the original hypothesis. The two remaining disks are found to be very H$_2$O-poor (Type P or H$_2$O-poor disks), yet show emission from either the hot or immediate reservoirs (depending on the fit) in addition to emission from the cold one. We find that different parametrisations are able to provide a good description of the observed H$_2$O spectra, with the multiple component analysis yielding similar results. Finally, we also report the detection of other molecules in these disks, including a tentative detection of CH$_4$ in CY Tau.</description>

      <title>Thermal emission effect on Chandrasekhar's $H(\mu)$-function for isotropic scattering in semi-infinite atmosphere problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chandrasekhars $H(\mu)$-function has long been a cornerstone of radiative transfer theory in semi-infinite, isotropically scattering atmospheres subjected to external illumination. However, this classical formulation does not account for thermal emission arising from internal heat sources, which is critical in a variety of astrophysical contexts such as hot Jupiters, brown dwarfs, and irradiated exoplanets, where the re-radiation of absorbed stellar energy significantly alters the emergent intensity. To address this limitation, we extend the diffuse reflection framework to incorporate both isotropic scattering and intrinsic thermal emission, leading to a generalized function known as the $M(\mu)$-function. Building on the formalism of Chandrashekhar (1960) combined with the recent work by Sengupta(2021), we derive the governing integral equations for the $M$-function and express it in terms of three key physical parameters: the radiation direction cosine $\mu$, the thermal emission coefficient $U(T) = B(T)/F$, and the single scattering albedo $\tilde{\omega}_0$. We implement a numerically stable iterative scheme, using Gaussian quadrature method to compute high-precision values of $M(\mu, U, \tilde{\omega}_0)$ across a broad parameter space. In the zero-emission limit, our results recover the classical $H$-function, thus validating the method.We provide comprehensive values of $M$-function for $\mu \in [0, 1]$, $U &lt; 0.7$, and $\tilde{\omega}_0 &lt; 1$, enabling direct application to modeling diffusely reflected intensities from thermally emitting atmospheres.As a case study, we apply this formalism to exoplanet K2-137b and identify the wavelength range (0.85 -2.5 $\mu$m) where the model is most applicable, highlighting its relevance to the observation range of the telescopes JWST, HST, ARIEL.</description>

      <title>Life after death: Europa in the evolving Habitable Zone of a Red Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars end their main-sequence (MS) lives by evolving through the red-giant and asymptotic-giant branches before ending as a quiescent, stable white dwarf. Therefore, it is imperative to model the post-MS as it relates to long-term stability of environments potentially suitable for life. Recent work has shown that gas giants can exist in the habitable zone (HZ) during the red giant phase and around a white dwarf remnant. Icy moons represent large reservoirs of water and will evolve through sublimation and melting when exposed to higher instellation, where the relatively lower surface gravity could lead to the rapid loss of all surface water. We model the surface evolution of Europa when initially exposed to habitable zone instellation in the red giant branch. Modeling the diurnal and yearly flux variations on a 2D map we show that, due to Jupiter's increased albedo, the sub-Jovian hemisphere of Europa largely sublimates while only the anti-Jovian equatorial band sublimates. With the increasing instellation of the red giant branch, both hemispheres sublimate substantially. We then model the evolution of a tenuous water-vapor atmosphere and show it is stable against atmospheric loss for at least 0.2 Gyr in the red giant branch habitable zone. We then present three ways to observe a sublimating Europan-like exomoon and potential spectra. Extending the results of this work to different planets and moons could open up a new pathway by which life could persist beyond the death of a star.</description>

      <title>Designing a Potential NASA Fermi Orbit Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, has over 16 years of operations providing gamma ray (8 keV to 300 Gev) spectra science observations of cosmic phenomena. It continues to provide invaluable research for the astrophysics community which include the study of pulsars, cosmic rays, gamma ray bursts, and coordination with gravity wave observations for neutron star mergers. The Fermi Earth orbit at a 500 x 512 km altitude is subject to collision warnings due to new constellations deployed near Fermi: currently over 7,000 satellites and growing. This paper presents analysis concerning changing Fermi's orbit and associated operational flight dynamics considerations. The cadence of burns and expected fuel use for a proposed orbit raise scenario is examined, ensuring that Fermi should have sufficient fuel for end of life operations. In addition, a Monte Carlo design is presented to capture single maneuver model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dwarf planet candidate in an extremely wide orbit: 2017 OF201</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90.5 au. Its orbit is extremely wide and extends to the inner Oort cloud, with a semi-major axis of 838 au and a perihelion of 44.9 au precisely determined from 19 observations over seven years. Assuming a typical albedo of 0.15, we estimate a diameter about 700 km, making it the second-largest known object in this dynamical population and a likely dwarf planet. Its high eccentricity suggests that it is part of a broader, unseen population of similar objects totaling about 1 % of Earth's mass. Notably, the orbit of 2017 OF201 lies well outside the clustering of longitude of perihelion observed in extreme trans-Neptunian objects, which has been proposed as dynamical evidence for a distant, undetected planet.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring short-term stellar activity in M dwarfs: A volume-limited perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares are short-lived but energetic manifestations of stellar activity. Studying them is crucial, as they emit intense high-energy radiation that can impact the circumstellar environment, especially the atmospheres of orbiting planets. This is particularly relevant for M dwarfs, which frequently flare and often host planets within their habitable zones. Flare-driven photoevaporation and photochemical processes may significantly affect planetary evolution. In this work, we analyzed the flaring properties of a volume-limited, unbiased sample of nearby M dwarfs using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We selected stars within 10 pc from Gaia DR3 and used an iterative Gaussian process to remove long-term stellar variability from the light curves, isolating impulsive flare events. For each flare, we measured amplitude, duration, and total emitted energy. Our sample includes 173 stars and 17,229 detected flares, ranging from 0 to 76 flares per TESS sector. We focused on three representative stars to highlight the diversity in flare activity. Detected flares had energies above 10^29 erg and durations from 2 to 8000 seconds. We modeled cumulative energy distributions with one- and two-slope power-law fits, finding average slopes of -0.79 +/- 0.64 and -1.23 +/- 1.32, respectively. We introduced the Flare Energy Index (GF.01) to describe flare frequency, identifying two populations: fainter stars tend to produce fewer high-energy flares, while brighter stars exhibit more frequent low-energy flares. Finally, we investigated two highly active stars, G 227-22 and G 258-33, observed across many sectors, to study long-term flare behavior and energy trends.</description>

      <title>An efficient integrator for stellar dynamics in effective gravity fields based on the isochrone potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Integrating the motion of stars in a smoothed potential is necessary in many stellar and galactic studies. Previous works have often used numerical integrators that alternate between linear drifts and velocity kicks (such as the Leapfrog scheme). This approach contrasts with the sophisticated methods developed in planetary dynamics, for which integrators alternate between Keplerian drifts and velocity kicks.
  Aims. Inspired by the splitting methods used in planetary dynamics, we aim to build an integration scheme dedicated to stellar and galactic dynamics.
  Methods. We took advantage of the properties of H\'enon's isochrone potential to design a symplectic splitting scheme that can be used to integrate the motion of stars in any gravitational potential. This scheme alternates between isochrone drifts and velocity kicks. As a first application, we consider the motion of a star in a Plummer potential -- an essential constituent of galactic potentials -- and determine integration parameters that provide the best efficiency (i.e. best conservation of energy for lowest computational cost).
  Results. We derive the analytical solution for all kinds of orbits in H\'enon's isochrone potential (bound and unbound trajectories) as needed in our integration scheme. Our experiments for stars in a Plummer potential show excellent performances in the inner and outer parts of the gravity field, that is, where the motion of stars is well approximated by isochrone trajectories (with perturbations of order $10^{-3}$ or less). For highly elongated orbits that cross the characteristic length of the Plummer potential, the performance is equivalent to that of previous methods.
  Conclusions. The splitting scheme presented here is a good alternative to previous methods: it performs at least as well, and up to orders of magnitude better, depending on the dynamical regime of the star.</description>

      <title>Validating the Orbital Periods of the Coolest TESS Exoplanet Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the resulting eclipse causes an observable decrease in stellar flux, and when multiple such transits are detected, the orbital period of the exoplanet can be determined. Over the past six years, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered thousands of potential planets by this method, mostly with short orbital periods, although some have longer reported values over one hundred days. These long orbital periods, however, are note easy to confirm due to frequent lengthy data gaps. Here we show that while the majority of these long period candidates likely have periods much shorter than reported, there are a sizable number of TESS candidates with true long periods. These candidates generally only have two reported transits, but the periods of duo-transits like this, and even candidates with three or more transits, can be confirmed if the data rules out all possible shorter period aliases. Using TESS data, we confirm long orbital periods for nine candidate planets, and present five others that are likely long period. Due to their long periods, these planets will have relatively cool equilibrium temperatures, and may be more likely to host exomoons or rings. We present these TOIs, along with a variety of small corrections to other TESS orbital periods and three planet candidates with possible transit timing variations, with the goal of refining the TESS data set and enabling future research with respect to cool transiting planets.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical investigation on N2 pressure-induced coefficients of the lowest rotational transitions of HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental determination of room-temperature N2 pressure broadening, speed dependent broadening, and pressure shift coefficients of the three lowest rotational lines of HCN. The experimental results served to assess the accuracy of a low-cost yet accurate computational strategy, which relies on a simplified characterization of the HCN-N2 interaction potential, and employs a novel approximate method of solving the quantum scattering problem. Building on the validation of this computational approach, the dataset was extended to higher rotational transitions, up to J(HCN)=5-4. For these transitions, we provide the temperature dependence of the pressure broadening coefficient, its speed dependence parameter, and the Dicke narrowing parameter. This new dataset can support and refine the modeling of HCN in both the terrestrial and Titan's atmospheres. This work constitutes an important step towards populating spectroscopic databases with accurate HCN line-shape parameters.</description>
