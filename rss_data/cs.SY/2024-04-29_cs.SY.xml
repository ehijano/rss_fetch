      <title>Shared learning of powertrain control policies for vehicle fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging data-driven approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aim at on-the-field learning of powertrain control policies that optimize fuel economy and other performance metrics. Indeed, they have shown great potential in this regard for individual vehicles on specific routes or drive cycles. However, for fleets of vehicles that must service a distribution of routes, DRL approaches struggle with learning stability issues that result in high variances and challenge their practical deployment. In this paper, we present a novel framework for shared learning among a fleet of vehicles through the use of a distilled group policy as the knowledge sharing mechanism for the policy learning computations at each vehicle. We detail the mathematical formulation that makes this possible. Several scenarios are considered to analyze the functionality, performance, and computational scalability of the framework with fleet size. Comparisons of the cumulative performance of fleets using our proposed shared learning approach with a baseline of individual learning agents and another state-of-the-art approach with a centralized learner show clear advantages to our approach. For example, we find a fleet average asymptotic improvement of 8.5 percent in fuel economy compared to the baseline while also improving on the metrics of acceleration error and shifting frequency for fleets serving a distribution of suburban routes. Furthermore, we include demonstrative results that show how the framework reduces variance within a fleet and also how it helps individual agents adapt better to new routes.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamic Operating Envelopes on Distribution Network Hosting Capacity for Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The examination of the maximum number of electric vehicles (EVs) that can be integrated into the distribution network (DN) without causing any operational incidents has become increasingly crucial as EV penetration rises. This issue can be addressed by utilizing dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs), which are generated based on the grid status. While DOEs improve the hosting capacity of the DN for EVs (EV-HC) by restricting the operational parameters of the network, they also alter the amount of energy needed for charging each EV, resulting in a decrease in the quality of service (QoS). This study proposes a network-aware hosting capacity framework for EVs (EV-NAHC) that i) aims to assess the effects of DOEs on active distribution networks, ii) introduces a novel definition for HC and calculates the EV-NAHC based on the aggregated QoS of all customers. A small-scale Belgian feeder is utilized to examine the proposed framework. The results show a substantial increase in the EV-NAHC with low, medium, and high-daily charging energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Safety and Reach-avoid Verification of Stochastic Discrete-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies finite-time safety and reach-avoid verification for stochastic discrete-time dynamical systems. The aim is to ascertain lower and upper bounds of the probability that, within a predefined finite-time horizon, a system starting from an initial state in a safe set will either exit the safe set (safety verification) or reach a target set while remaining within the safe set until the first encounter with the target (reach-avoid verification). We introduce novel barrier-like sufficient conditions for characterizing these bounds, which either complement existing ones or fill gaps. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of these conditions on two examples.</description>

      <title>Auto-Optimized Maximum Torque Per Ampere Control of IPMSM Using Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control strategy for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) using dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE). In the proposed method, the permanent magnet flux and the difference between the $d$- and $q$-axis inductance are identified by multiple estimators using the recursive least square method. The initial values of the estimated parameters in different estimators are different. By using multiple estimators, exploration of the operational environment to reduce knowledge uncertainty can be realized. Compared to those MTPA control strategies based on the extremum-seeking method, the proposed method has better dynamic performance when speed or load varies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Synthesis of Passivity-Based Distributed Controllers for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution for exploiting renewable energy resources (RESs). Most of the existing papers on DC MGs focused on controller design. However, in this paper, we proposed a co-design passivity-based control (PBC) that designs the controller and communication topology simultaneously. In addition, the plug-and-play feature is maintained without compromising the stability and re-designing of the remaining controllers. To this end, the local controller for distributed generators (DGs) and lines are obtained using smaller decentralized LMI problems, and then the global controller is formulated using the passivity indices of the local controller to restore voltages to the reference value.</description>

      <title>LINOCS: Lookahead Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Dynamic State Estimation of Photovoltaic Systems via Sparse Regression Unscented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic state estimation (DSE) is vital in modern power systems with numerous inverter-based distributed energy resources including solar and wind, ensuring real-time accuracy for tracking system variables and optimizing grid stability. This paper proposes a data-driven DSE approach designed for photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion systems (single stage and two stage) that are subjected to both process and measurement noise. The proposed framework follows a two-phase methodology encompassing ``data-driven model identification" and ``state-estimation." In the initial model identification phase, state feedback is gathered to elucidate the dynamics of the photovoltaic systems using nonlinear sparse regression technique. Following the identification of the PV dynamics, the nonlinear data-driven model will be utilized to estimate the dynamics of the PV system for monitoring and protection purposes. To account for incomplete measurements, inherent uncertainties, and noise, we employ an ``unscented Kalman filter," which facilitates state estimation by processing the noisy output data. Ultimately, the paper substantiates the efficacy of the proposed sparse regression-based unscented Kalman filter through simulation results, providing a comparative analysis with a physics-based DSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim in this paper is to apply the iLQR, iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator, to control the movement of a mobile robot following an already defined trajectory. This control strategy has proven its utility for nonlinear systems. As follows up, this work intends to concertize this statement and to evaluate the extent to which the performance is comparatively improved against the ordinary, non-iterative LQR. The method is applied to a differential robot with non-holonomic constraints. The mathematical equations, resulting description and the implementation of this method are explicitly explained, and the simulation studies are conducted in the Matlab and Simulink environment.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Convolutional Neural Network for Microgrid Economic Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of renewable energy generation and the unpredictability of electricity demand create a need for real-time economic dispatch (ED) of assets in microgrids. However, solving numerical optimization problems in real-time can be incredibly challenging. This study proposes using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning to address these challenges. Compared to traditional methods, CNN is more efficient, delivers more dependable results, and has a shorter response time when dealing with uncertainties. While CNN has shown promising results, it does not extract explainable knowledge from the data. To address this limitation, a physics-inspired CNN model is developed by incorporating constraints of the ED problem into the CNN training to ensure that the model follows physical laws while fitting the data. The proposed method can significantly accelerate real-time economic dispatch of microgrids without compromising the accuracy of numerical optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach for optimal allocation of microgrid resources in real-time is verified through a comprehensive comparison with conventional numerical optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimension Collision-Free Trajectory Planning of UAVs Based on ADS-B Information in Low-Altitude Urban Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environment of low-altitude urban airspace is complex and variable due to numerous obstacles, non-cooperative aircrafts, and birds. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</description>

      <title>A hybrid prognosis approach for robust lifetime control of commercial wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic fluctuations in the wind field to which a wind turbine (WT) is exposed to are responsible for fatigue loads on its components. To reduce structural loads in WTs, advanced control schemes have been proposed. In recent years, prognosis-based lifetime control of WTs has become increasingly important. In this approach, the prognostic controller gains are adapted based on the stateof-health (SOH) of the WT component to achieve the desired lifetime. However, stochastic wind dynamics complicates estimation of the SOH of a WT. More recently, robust controllers have been combined with real-time damage evaluation models to meet prognosis objectives. Most rely on model-based online load cycle counting algorithms to determine fatigue damage, with analytical models providing the degradation estimate. However, most use load measurements that are either unreliable or unavailable in commercial WTs, limiting their practicality. In this contribution, a hybrid prognosis scheme combining data-driven load prediction and model-based damage estimation models for robust lifetime control of commercial WTs is proposed. A data-driven support vector machine (SVM) regression model is trained using loading data obtained from dynamic simulations using a {\mu}-synthesis robust disturbance accommodating controller (RDAC). The regression model uses available WT measurements to predict tower load. Based on this prediction, an online rain-flow counting (RFC) damage evaluation model estimates the damage level and lifetime of the tower. The RDAC controller gains are dynamically adapted to achieve a predefined damage limit and lifetime. The proposed approach is evaluated on a 5 MW reference WT and its performance is compared with a model-based prognosis scheme using ideal WT tower measurement. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to control the fatigue lifetime in WT components.</description>

      <title>Whale Optimization Algorithm-based Fractional Order Fuzzy Type-II PI Control for Modular Multilevel Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a robust controller for Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) is crucial to ensure stability and optimal dynamic performance under various operating conditions, including faulty and disturbed scenarios. The primary objective of controlling grid-connected MMCs (GC-MMCs) is to accurately track real and reactive power references while maintaining excellent harmonic performance in the output response. This paper proposes a novel model-free control strategy for GC-MMCs, employing a Fractional Order Proportional-Integral (FOPI) controller and a Fractional Order Fuzzy type-II Proportional-Integral (FOFPI) controller. The FOFPI controller utilizes a type-II Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to adaptively adjust the proportional and derivative gains during the control process, enabling effective control of the MMC under diverse operating conditions. The type-II FIS, which leverages type-II fuzzy sets, can mitigate uncertainty and nonlinearity in the system. Furthermore, the incorporation of fractional-order mathematics enhances the flexibility of the proposed controllers. To optimize the initial parameters of the proposed controllers, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a meta-heuristic algorithm, is employed. The results demonstrate that the proposed controllers exhibit superior performance under voltage disturbance conditions, varying input voltage, and can ensure the stability of the MMC.</description>

      <title>Safe Reach Set Computation via Neural Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for online safety verification of autonomous systems, which performs reachability analysis efficiently for both bounded and unbounded horizons by employing neural barrier certificates. Our approach uses barrier certificates given by parameterized neural networks that depend on a given initial set, unsafe sets, and time horizon. Such networks are trained efficiently offline using system simulations sampled from regions of the state space. We then employ a meta-neural network to generalize the barrier certificates to state space regions that are outside the training set. These certificates are generated and validated online as sound over-approximations of the reachable states, thus either ensuring system safety or activating appropriate alternative actions in unsafe scenarios. We demonstrate our technique on case studies from linear models to nonlinear control-dependent models for online autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Control Policy Correction Framework for Reinforcement Learning-based Energy Arbitrage Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous rise in the penetration of renewable energy sources, along with the use of the single imbalance pricing, provides a new opportunity for balance responsible parties to reduce their cost through energy arbitrage in the imbalance settlement mechanism. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods are an appropriate choice for solving the energy arbitrage problem due to their outstanding performance in solving complex stochastic sequential problems. However, RL is rarely deployed in real-world applications since its learned policy does not necessarily guarantee safety during the execution phase. In this paper, we propose a new RL-based control framework for batteries to obtain a safe energy arbitrage strategy in the imbalance settlement mechanism. In our proposed control framework, the agent initially aims to optimize the arbitrage revenue. Subsequently, in the post-processing step, we correct (constrain) the learned policy following a knowledge distillation process based on properties that follow human intuition. Our post-processing step is a generic method and is not restricted to the energy arbitrage domain. We use the Belgian imbalance price of 2023 to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we deploy our proposed control framework on a real battery to show its capability in the real world.</description>

      <title>ROMA-iQSS: An Objective Alignment Approach via State-Based Value Learning and ROund-Robin Multi-Agent Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration is imperative for solving complex, distributed problems. In this context, two key challenges must be addressed: first, autonomously identifying optimal objectives for collective outcomes; second, aligning these objectives among agents. Traditional frameworks, often reliant on centralized learning, struggle with scalability and efficiency in large multi-agent systems. To overcome these issues, we introduce a decentralized state-based value learning algorithm that enables agents to independently discover optimal states. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism for multi-agent interaction, wherein less proficient agents follow and adopt policies from more experienced ones, thereby indirectly guiding their learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that our approach leads decentralized agents to an optimal collective policy. Empirical experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing decentralized state-based and action-based value learning strategies by effectively identifying and aligning optimal objectives.</description>

The CPG network consists of six weakly coupled limit-cycle oscillators, whose synchronization dynamics can be described by six phase equations through phase reduction. Focusing on the transitions between the hexapod gaits with specific symmetries, the six phase equations of the CPG network can further be reduced to two independent equations for the phase differences. By choosing appropriate coupling functions for the network, we can achieve desired synchronization dynamics regardless of the detailed properties of the limit-cycle oscillators used for the CPG. The effectiveness of our CPG network is demonstrated by numerical simulations of gait transitions between the wave, tetrapod, and tripod gaits, using the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator as the CPG unit.</description>

      <title>Impact of Traffic-Following on Order of Autonomous Airspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamic emergence of traffic order in a distributed multi-agent system, aiming to minimize inefficiencies that stem from unnecessary structural impositions. We introduce a methodology for developing a dynamically-updating traffic pattern map of the airspace by leveraging information about the consistency and frequency of flow directions used by current as well as preceding traffic. Informed by this map, an agent can discern the degree to which it is advantageous to follow traffic by trading off utilities such as time and order. We show that for the traffic levels studied, for low degrees of traffic-following behavior, there is minimal penalty in terms of aircraft travel times while improving the overall orderliness of the airspace. On the other hand, heightened traffic-following behavior may result in increased aircraft travel times, while marginally reducing the overall entropy of the airspace. Ultimately, the methods and metrics presented in this paper can be used to optimally and dynamically adjust an agent's traffic-following behavior based on these trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Energy Storage Arbitrage in Two-settlement Markets: A Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated model for bidding energy storage in day-ahead and real-time markets to maximize profits. We show that in integrated two-stage bidding, the real-time bids are independent of day-ahead settlements, while the day-ahead bids should be based on predicted real-time prices. We utilize a transformer-based model for real-time price prediction, which captures complex dynamical patterns of real-time prices, and use the result for day-ahead bidding design. For real-time bidding, we utilize a long short-term memory-dynamic programming hybrid real-time bidding model. We train and test our model with historical data from New York State, and our results showed that the integrated system achieved promising results of almost a 20\% increase in profit compared to only bidding in real-time markets, and at the same time reducing the risk in terms of the number of days with negative profits.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Model Assisted Energy-Saving Design in Radio Access Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous emergence of novel services and massive connections involve huge energy consumption towards ultra-dense radio access networks. Moreover, there exist much more number of controllable parameters that can be adjusted to reduce the energy consumption from a network-wide perspective. However, a network-level energy-saving intent usually contains multiple network objectives and constraints. Therefore, it is critical to decompose a network-level energy-saving intent into multiple levels of configurated operations from a top-down refinement perspective. In this work, we utilize a softgoal interdependency graph decomposition model to assist energy-saving scheme design. Meanwhile, we propose an energy-saving approach based on deep Q-network, which achieve a better trade-off among the energy consumption, the throughput, and the first packet delay. In addition, we illustrate how the decomposition model can assist in making energy-saving decisions. Evaluation results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed scheme in accelerating the model training process.</description>

      <title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid. Despite the importance of having updated firmware / software versions within a reasonable time frame, existing methods for establishing trust through firmware updates lack effective historical tracking and verification. This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Dynamics Modeling of Miniature Robotic Blimps Using Neural ODEs With Parameter Auto-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniature robotic blimps, as one type of lighter-than-air aerial vehicles, have attracted increasing attention in the science and engineering community for their enhanced safety, extended endurance, and quieter operation compared to quadrotors. Accurately modeling the dynamics of these robotic blimps poses a significant challenge due to the complex aerodynamics stemming from their large lifting bodies. Traditional first-principle models have difficulty obtaining accurate aerodynamic parameters and often overlook high-order nonlinearities, thus coming to its limit in modeling the motion dynamics of miniature robotic blimps. To tackle this challenge, this letter proposes the Auto-tuning Blimp-oriented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation method (ABNODE), a data-driven approach that integrates first-principle and neural network modeling. Spiraling motion experiments of robotic blimps are conducted, comparing the ABNODE with first-principle and other data-driven benchmark models, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Socially Adaptive Path Planning Based on Generative Adversarial Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural interaction between robots and pedestrians in the process of autonomous navigation is crucial for the intelligent development of mobile robots, which requires robots to fully consider social rules and guarantee the psychological comfort of pedestrians. Among the research results in the field of robotic path planning, the learning-based socially adaptive algorithms have performed well in some specific human-robot interaction environments. However, human-robot interaction scenarios are diverse and constantly changing in daily life, and the generalization of robot socially adaptive path planning remains to be further investigated. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a new socially adaptive path planning algorithm by combining the generative adversarial network (GAN) with the Optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) navigation algorithm. Firstly, a GAN model with strong generalization performance is proposed to adapt the navigation algorithm to more scenarios. Secondly, a GAN model based Optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree navigation algorithm (GAN-RRT*) is proposed to generate paths in human-robot interaction environments. Finally, we propose a socially adaptive path planning framework named GAN-RTIRL, which combines the GAN model with Rapidly-exploring random Trees Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RTIRL) to improve the homotopy rate between planned and demonstration paths. In the GAN-RTIRL framework, the GAN-RRT* path planner can update the GAN model from the demonstration path. In this way, the robot can generate more anthropomorphic paths in human-robot interaction environments and has stronger generalization in more complex environments. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method can effectively improve the anthropomorphic degree of robot motion planning and the homotopy rate between planned and demonstration paths.</description>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in simulation domains, yet its application in designing robot controllers remains limited, due to its single-task orientation and insufficient adaptability to environmental changes. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel adaptive agent that leverages transfer learning techniques to dynamically adapt policy in response to different tasks and environmental conditions. The approach is validated through the blimp control challenge, where multitasking capabilities and environmental adaptability are essential. The agent is trained using a custom, highly parallelized simulator built on IsaacGym. We perform zero-shot transfer to fly the blimp in the real world to solve various tasks. We share our code at \url{https://github.com/robot-perception-group/adaptive\_agent/}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate positioning and fast traversal times determine the productivity in machining applications. This paper demonstrates a hierarchical contour control implementation for the increase of productivity in positioning systems. The high-level controller pre-optimizes the input to a low-level cascade controller, using a contouring predictive control approach. This control structure requires tuning of multiple parameters. We propose a sample-efficient tuning algorithm, where the performance metrics associated with the full geometry traversal are modelled as Gaussian processes and used to form the global cost and the constraints in a constrained Bayesian optimization algorithm. This approach enables the trade-off between fast traversal, high tracking accuracy, and suppression of vibrations in the system. The performance improvement is evaluated numerically when tuning different combinations of parameters. We demonstrate that tuning the parameters of the MPC contour-controller achieves the best performance in terms of time, tracking accuracy, and minimization of the vibrations in the system.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general notion of dissipativity with dynamic supply rates for nonlinear systems. This extends classical dissipativity with static supply rates and dynamic supply rates of miscellaneous quadratic forms. The main results of this paper concern Lyapunov and asymptotic stability analysis for nonlinear feedback dissipative systems that are characterised by dissipation inequalities with respect to compatible dynamic supply rates but involving possibly different and independent auxiliary systems. Importantly, dissipativity conditions guaranteeing stability of the state of the feedback systems, without concerns on the stability of the state of the auxiliary systems, are provided. The key results also specialise to a simple coupling test for the interconnection of two nonlinear systems described by dynamic (Psi, Pi, Upsilon, Omega)-dissipativity, and are shown to recover several existing results in the literature, including small-gain, passivity indices, static (Q, S, R)-dissipativity, dissipativity with terminal costs, etc. Comparison with the input-output approach to feedback stability analysis based on integral quadratic constraints is also made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present IntervalMDP.jl, a Julia package for probabilistic analysis of interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs). IntervalMDP.jl facilitates the synthesis of optimal strategies and verification of IMDPs against reachability specifications and discounted reward properties. The library supports sparse matrices and is compatible with data formats from common tools for the analysis of probabilistic models, such as PRISM. A key feature of IntervalMDP.jl is that it presents both a multi-threaded CPU and a GPU-accelerated implementation of value iteration algorithms for IMDPs. In particular, IntervalMDP.jl takes advantage of the Julia type system and the inherently parallelizable nature of value iteration to improve the efficiency of performing analysis of IMDPs. On a set of examples, we show that IntervalMDP.jl substantially outperforms existing tools for verification and strategy synthesis for IMDPs in both computation time and memory consumption.</description>

      <title>The Role of Identification in Data-driven Policy Iteration: A System Theoretic Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to study fundamental mechanisms behind so-called indirect and direct data-driven control for unknown systems. Specifically, we consider policy iteration applied to the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two iterative procedures, where data collected from the system are repeatedly used to compute new estimates of the desired optimal controller, are considered. In indirect policy iteration, data are used to obtain an updated model estimate through a recursive identification scheme, which is used in a certainty-equivalent fashion to perform the classic policy iteration update. By casting the concurrent model identification and control design as a feedback interconnection between two algorithmic systems, we provide a closed-loop analysis that shows convergence and robustness properties for arbitrary levels of excitation in the data. In direct policy iteration, data are used to approximate the value function and design the associated controller without requiring the intermediate identification step. After proposing an extension to a recently proposed scheme that overcomes potential identifiability issues, we establish under which conditions this procedure is guaranteed to deliver the optimal controller. Based on these analyses we are able to compare the strengths and limitations of the two approaches, highlighting aspects such as the required samples, convergence properties, and excitation requirement. Simulations are also provided to illustrate the results.</description>

Abstract: Predictive safety filters provide a way of projecting potentially unsafe inputs, proposed, e.g. by a human or learning-based controller, onto the set of inputs that guarantee recursive state and input constraint satisfaction by leveraging model predictive control techniques. In this paper, we extend this framework such that in addition, robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed by enforcing a decrease of an implicit Lyapunov function which is constructed using a predicted system trajectory. Differently from previous results, we show robust asymptotic stability with respect to a predefined disturbance set on an extended state consisting of the system state and a warmstart input sequence. The proposed strategy is applied to an automotive lane keeping example in simulation.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes an interval observer design for nonlinear discrete-time systems based on the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) paradigm. Our design extends to generic nonlinear systems without any assumption on the structure of its dynamics and output maps. Relying on a transformation putting the system into a target form where an interval observer can be directly designed, we then propose a method to reconstruct the bounds in the original coordinates using the bounds in the target coordinates, thanks to the Lipschitz injectivity of this transformation achieved under Lipschitz distinguishability when the target dynamics have a high enough dimension and are pushed sufficiently fast. An academic example serves to illustrate our methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dynamic Ancillary Services Provision Based on Local Power Grid Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a systematic closed-loop approach to provide optimal dynamic ancillary services with converter-interfaced generation systems based on local power grid perception. In particular, we structurally encode dynamic ancillary services such as fast frequency and voltage regulation in the form of a parametric transfer function matrix, which includes several parameters to define a set of different feasible response behaviors, among which we aim to find the optimal one to be realized by the converter system. Our approach is based on a so-called "perceive-and-optimize" (P&amp;O) strategy: First, we identify a grid dynamic equivalent at the interconnection terminals of the converter system. Second, we consider the closed-loop interconnection of the identified grid equivalent and the parametric transfer function matrix, which we optimize for the set of transfer function parameters, resulting in a stable and optimal closed-loop performance for ancillary services provision. In the process, we ensure that grid-code and device-level requirements are satisfied. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different numerical case studies based on a modified Kundur two-area test system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, a biophysically realistic model of a soft octopus arm with internal musculature is presented. The modeling is motivated by experimental observations of sensorimotor control where an arm localizes and reaches a target. Major contributions of this article are: (i) development of models to capture the mechanical properties of arm musculature, the electrical properties of the arm peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the coupling of PNS with muscular contractions; (ii) modeling the arm sensory system, including chemosensing and proprioception; and (iii) algorithms for sensorimotor control, which include a novel feedback neural motor control law for mimicking target-oriented arm reaching motions, and a novel consensus algorithm for solving sensing problems such as locating a food source from local chemical sensory information (exogenous) and arm deformation information (endogenous). Several analytical results, including rest-state characterization and stability properties of the proposed sensing and motor control algorithms, are provided. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Qualitative comparisons against observed arm rest shapes and target-oriented reaching motions are also reported.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Smooth Control via Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode for Distributed Space Telescope Demonstration Mission by CubeSat Formation Flying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04718</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode and adaptive smooth control method for the distributed space telescope demonstration mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that corresponds to the relative position of the formation flying concept. The precise formation flying technology by CubeSats enhances the utility of distributed space systems with low costs. The propulsion systems for CubeSats usually have restricted degrees of freedom. Since the scientific mission requires continuous orbit control, the attitude and orbit control system mutually affect the control performance. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode has the advantage of a fast convergence rate and is able to improve the control performance. The adaptive smooth controller designed for the SISO system is expanded and applied to the attitude and orbit control system. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the adaptive smooth controller based on the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode.</description>

      <title>A Tunable Universal Formula for Safety-Critical Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sontag's universal formula is a widely-used technique for stabilizing control through control Lyapunov functions, and it has been extended to address safety-critical control in recent years by incorporating control barrier functions (CBFs). However, how to derive a universal formula that satisfies requirements on essential properties, including safety, robustness, and smoothness, is still an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel solution - a tunable universal formula - by incorporating a (state-dependent) tunable scaling term into Sontag's universal formula. This tunable scaling term enables the regulation of safety control performances, allowing the attainment of desired properties through a proper selection. Furthermore, we extend this tunable universal formula to address safety-critical control problems with norm-bounded input constraints, showcasing its applicability across diverse control scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a collision avoidance example, investigating the essential properties including safety, robustness, and smoothness under various tunable scaling terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Iterated Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IIEKF), which is an invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) where the updated state in the light of the latest measurement is defined as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. Under some compatibility requirements on the output map, we prove strong mathematical guarantees which echo those of the Kalman filter in the linear case. We apply the technique to two problems: solving a system of equations on a Lie group, and a problem of engineering interest, namely ego-localization of the hook of a crane. The latter serves as a benchmarking example, where the IIEKF favorably compares to other filters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive tracking control for non-periodic reference signals under quantized observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an adaptive tracking control problem for stochastic regression systems with multi-threshold quantized observations. Different from the existing studies for periodic reference signals, the reference signal in this paper is non-periodic. Its main difficulty is how to ensure that the designed controller satisfies the uniformly bounded and excitation conditions that guarantee the convergence of the estimation in the controller under non-periodic signal conditions. This paper designs two backward-shifted polynomials with time-varying parameters and a special projection structure, which break through periodic limitations and establish the convergence and tracking properties. To be specific, the adaptive tracking control law can achieve asymptotically optimal tracking for the non-periodic reference signal; Besides, the proposed estimation algorithm is proved to converge to the true values in almost sure and mean square sense, and the convergence speed can reach $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ under suitable conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive tracking control scheme is verified through a simulation.</description>

      <title>The Continuous-Time Weighted-Median Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models are important in understanding and predicting opinion formation processes within social groups. Although the weighted-averaging opinion-update mechanism is widely adopted as the micro-foundation of opinion dynamics, it bears a non-negligibly unrealistic implication: opinion attractiveness increases with opinion distance. Recently, the weighted-median mechanism has been proposed as a new microscopic mechanism of opinion exchange. Numerous advancements have been achieved regarding this new micro-foundation, from theoretical analysis to empirical validation, in a discrete-time asynchronous setup. However, the original discrete-time weighted-median model does not allow for "compromise behavior" in opinion exchanges, i.e., no intermediate opinions are created between disagreeing agents. To resolve this problem, this paper propose a novel continuous-time weighted-median opinion dynamics model, in which agents' opinions move towards the weighted-medians of their out-neighbors' opinions. It turns out that the proof methods for the original discrete-time asynchronous model are no longer applicable to the analysis of the continuous-time model. In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the continuous-time weighted-median opinion dynamics by showing that the weighted-median mapping is contractive on any graph. We also characterize the set of all the equilibria. Then, by leveraging a new LaSalle invariance principle argument, we prove the convergence of the continuous-time weighted-median model for any initial condition and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence to consensus.</description>

      <title>Uninterrupted Maximum Flow on Signalized Traffic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a traffic signal control strategy that allows motorists who travel at a recommended speed on suburban arterial two-way roads with a common cycle time to make every traffic signal. A road-to-traveler-feedback-device (RTFD) advises motorists how fast they should travel to do this. Signalized arterial roads where vehicles that travel at the recommended speed make every traffic signal are termed Ride-the-Green-Wave (RGW) roads. Left-turn-arounds enable vehicles to turn left from two-way RGW-roads to intersecting/orthogonal two-way RGW-road while allowing maximum flow at the intersection. The traffic signal control technique that enables vehicles that travel at the recommended speed to make every traffic signal has been verified using a simulation program (RGW-SIM). In addition to introducing novel traffic signal control strategies, the methods presented in this paper have implications for road network design, public transport control, connected and automated vehicles and environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Relay Mining: Incentivizing Full Non-Validating Nodes Servicing All RPC Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relay Mining presents a scalable solution employing probabilistic mechanisms, crypto-economic incentives, and new cryptographic primitives to estimate and prove the volume of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) made from a client to a server. Distributed ledgers are designed to secure permissionless state transitions (writes), highlighting a gap for incentivizing full non-validating nodes to service non-transactional (read) RPCs. This leads applications to have a dependency on altruistic or centralized off-chain Node RPC Providers. We present a solution that enables multiple RPC providers to service requests from independent applications on a permissionless network. We leverage digital signatures, commit-and-reveal schemes, and Sparse Merkle Sum Tries (SMSTs) to prove the amount of work done. This is enabled through the introduction of a novel ClosestMerkleProof proof-of-inclusion scheme. A native cryptocurrency on a distributed ledger is used to rate limit applications and disincentivize over-usage. Building upon established research in token bucket algorithms and distributed rate-limiting penalty models, our approach harnesses a feedback loop control mechanism to adjust the difficulty of mining relay rewards, dynamically scaling with network usage growth. By leveraging crypto-economic incentives, we reduce coordination overhead costs and introduce a mechanism for providing RPC services that are both geopolitically and geographically distributed. We use common formulations from rate limiting research to demonstrate how this solution in the Web3 ecosystem translates to distributed verifiable multi-tenant rate limiting in Web2.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Learning for Dynamic Load Planning in Trucking Service Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The load planning problem is a critical challenge in service network design for parcel carriers: it decides how many trailers to assign for dispatch over time between pairs of terminals. Another key challenge is to determine a flow plan, which specifies how parcel volumes are assigned to planned loads. This paper considers the Outbound Load Planning Problem (OLPP) that considers flow and load planning challenges jointly in order to adjust loads and flows as the demand forecast changes over time before the day of operations in a terminal. The paper aims at developing a decision-support tool to inform planners making these decisions at terminals across the network. The paper formulates the OLPP as a mixed-integer programming model and shows that it admits a large number of symmetries in a network where each commodity can be routed through primary and alternate terminals. As a result, an optimization solver may return fundamentally different solutions to closely related problems, confusing planners and reducing trust in optimization. To remedy this limitation, this paper proposes a lexicographical optimization approach that eliminates those symmetries by generating optimal solutions staying close to a reference plan. Moreover, this paper designs an optimization proxy that addresses the computational challenges of the optimization model. The optimization proxy combines a machine-learning model and a repair procedure to find near-optimal solutions that satisfy real-time constraints imposed by planners in the loop. An extensive computational study on industrial instances shows that the optimization proxy is orders of magnitude faster for generating solutions that are consistent with each other. The proposed approach also demonstrates the benefits of the OLPP for load consolidation and the significant savings obtained from combining machine learning and optimization.</description>

      <title>VIO-DualProNet: Visual-Inertial Odometry with Learning Based Process Noise Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is a vital technique used in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. It combines visual and inertial measurements to accurately estimate position and orientation. Existing VIO methods assume a fixed noise covariance for the inertial uncertainty. However, accurately determining in real-time the noise variance of the inertial sensors presents a significant challenge as the uncertainty changes throughout the operation leading to suboptimal performance and reduced accuracy. To circumvent this, we propose VIO-DualProNet, a novel approach that utilizes deep learning methods to dynamically estimate the inertial noise uncertainty in real-time. By designing and training a deep neural network to predict inertial noise uncertainty using only inertial sensor measurements, and integrating it into the VINS-Mono algorithm, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in accuracy and robustness, enhancing VIO performance and potentially benefiting other VIO-based systems for precise localization and mapping across diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>OptiState: State Estimation of Legged Robots using Gated Networks with Transformer-based Vision and Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation for legged robots is challenging due to their highly dynamic motion and limitations imposed by sensor accuracy. By integrating Kalman filtering, optimization, and learning-based modalities, we propose a hybrid solution that combines proprioception and exteroceptive information for estimating the state of the robot's trunk. Leveraging joint encoder and IMU measurements, our Kalman filter is enhanced through a single-rigid body model that incorporates ground reaction force control outputs from convex Model Predictive Control optimization. The estimation is further refined through Gated Recurrent Units, which also considers semantic insights and robot height from a Vision Transformer autoencoder applied on depth images. This framework not only furnishes accurate robot state estimates, including uncertainty evaluations, but can minimize the nonlinear errors that arise from sensor measurements and model simplifications through learning. The proposed methodology is evaluated in hardware using a quadruped robot on various terrains, yielding a 65% improvement on the Root Mean Squared Error compared to our VIO SLAM baseline.

      <title>Who Plays First? Optimizing the Order of Play in Stackelberg Games with Many Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multi-agent spatial navigation problem of computing the socially optimal order of play, i.e., the sequence in which the agents commit to their decisions, and its associated equilibrium in an N-player Stackelberg trajectory game. We model this problem as a mixed-integer optimization problem over the space of all possible Stackelberg games associated with the order of play's permutations. To solve the problem, we introduce Branch and Play (B&amp;P), an efficient and exact algorithm that provably converges to a socially optimal order of play and its Stackelberg equilibrium. As a subroutine for B&amp;P, we employ and extend sequential trajectory planning, i.e., a popular multi-agent control approach, to scalably compute valid local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play. We demonstrate the practical utility of B&amp;P to coordinate air traffic control, swarm formation, and delivery vehicle fleets. We find that B&amp;P consistently outperforms various baselines, and computes the socially optimal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

Abstract: This article discusses the implementation of a software joint velocity limitation dedicated to a Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) with coaxial input shafts (CoSPM) using a speed control loop. Such an algorithm takes as input the current joint positions as well as the joint reference velocities computed by the speed controller and limit the latter in order to avoid any known singular configuration. This limitation takes into account the workspace properties of the mechanism and the physical characteristics of its actuators. In particular, one takes advantage of the coaxiality of the input shafts of the CoSPM and the resulting unlimited bearing.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Infinite Programs for Robust Control and Optimization: Efficient Solutions and Extensions to Existence Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time robust optimal control problems generally take a min-max structure over continuous variable spaces, which can be difficult to solve in practice. In this paper, we extend the class of such problems that can be solved through a previously proposed local reduction method to consider those with existence constraints on the uncountable variables. We also consider the possibility of non-unique trajectories that satisfy equality and inequality constraints. Crucially, we show that the problems of interest can be cast into a standard semi-infinite program and demonstrate how to generate optimal uncertainty scenario sets in order to obtain numerical solutions. We also include examples on model predictive control for obstacle avoidance with logical conditions, control with input saturation affected by uncertainty, and optimal parameter estimation to highlight the need for the proposed extension. Our method solves each of the examples considered, producing violation-free and locally optimal solutions.</description>
