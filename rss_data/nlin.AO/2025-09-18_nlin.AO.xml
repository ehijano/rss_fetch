      <title>A molecular rotor driven by an electric field on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for driving a dipolar molecular rotor to rotate continuously by applying an external electric field: the dipolar rotor is fixed on a graphene sheet via a metal atom to facilitate the free rotation; it is in the meantime subjected to an electric field oriented parallel to the graphene sheet. We use computational modeling with density functional theory and Newtonian mechanics, similar to molecular dynamics simulations, to obtain the torque, angular velocity, and rotation period of the rotor. Our results show that the dipolar rotor designed here can rotate with a period of 2.96 ps by an alternating rectangular electric field with a strength of 0.5 V/{\AA}. However, a cosine wave alternating electric field depending on time cannot drive the dipolar rotor to rotate regularly. Therefore, a cosine wave electric field depending on the rotation angle is suggested, as it can not only drive the rotor but also produce additional power. Machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations further confirm that the rotor remains thermodynamically stable under an electric field. This work reveals the rotation mechanism of a dipolar molecular rotor in a transverse electric field, and we hope this work can open a new path for designing more diverse molecular machines in experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiple Timescale Dynamics of Network Adaptation with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06359</link>

Abstract: Adaptive network dynamical systems describe the co-evolution of dynamical quantities on the nodes as well as dynamics of the network connections themselves. For dense networks of many nodes, the resulting dynamics are typically high-dimensional. Here we consider adaptive dynamical systems subject to constraints on network adaptation: Asymptotically, the adaptive dynamics of network connections evolve on a low-dimensional subset of possible connectivity. Such dimension reduction may be intrinsic to the adaptation rule or arise from an additional dynamical mechanism acting on a timescale distinct from that of network adaptation. We illustrate how network adaptation with various constraints influences the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillator networks and elucidate the role of multiple timescales in shaping the dynamics. Our results shed light on why one may expect effective low-dimensional adaptation dynamics in generally high-dimensional adaptive network dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Chemomechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemomechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</description>
