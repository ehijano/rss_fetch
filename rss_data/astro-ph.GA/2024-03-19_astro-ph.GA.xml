      <title>Circumnuclear Multi-phase Gas in the Circinus Galaxy. VI. Detectability of Molecular Inflow and Atomic Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent submillimeter observations have revealed signs of pc-scale molecular inflow and atomic outflow in the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxy, the Circinus galaxy. To verify the gas kinematics suggested by these observations, we performed molecular and atomic line transfer calculations based on a physics-based 3D radiation-hydrodynamic model, which has been compared with multi-wavelength observations in this paper series. The major axis position-velocity diagram (PVD) of CO(3-2) reproduces the observed faint emission at the systemic velocity, and our calculations confirm that this component originates from failed winds falling back to the disk plane. The minor-axis PVD of [CI]($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$), when created using only the gas with positive radial velocities, presents a sign of blue- and redshifted offset peaks similar to those in the observation, suggesting that the observed peaks indeed originate from the outflow, but that the model may lack outflows as strong as those in the Circinus galaxy. Similar to the observed HCN(3-2), the similar dense gas tracer HCO$^+$(3-2) can exhibit nuclear spectra with inverse P-Cygni profiles with $\sim$0.5 pc beams, but the line shape is azimuthally dependent. The corresponding continuum absorbers are inflowing clumps at 5-10 pc from the center. To detect significant absorption with a high probability, the inclination must be fairly edge-on ($\gtrsim$85$^\circ$), and the beam size must be small ($\lesssim$1 pc). These results suggest that HCN or HCO$^+$ and [CI] lines are effective for observing pc-scale inflows and outflows, respectively.</description>

      <title>Detailed chemical composition of the globular cluster Sextans A GC-1 on the outskirts of the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of globular clusters (GCs) across the Local Group provides information on chemical abundance trends. The host galaxy, Sextans A, is a low-surface-brightness dwarf irregular galaxy located on the edge of the Local Group.We derive the dynamical mass of the GC together with the mass-to-light ratio and the abundances of the ${\alpha}$ (Mg, Ca, Ti, Si), Fe-peak (Fe, Cr, Mn, Sc, Ni), and heavy elements (Ba, Cu, Zn, Eu). Abundance ratios were determined from the analysis of an optical integrated-light spectrum of Sextans A GC-1, obtained with UVES on the VLT. We apply non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni. The GC appears to be younger and more metal-poor than the majority of the GCs of the Milky Way, with an age of 8.6$\pm$2.7 Gyr and $\text{[Fe/H]}=-2.14\pm0.04$ dex. The calculated dynamical mass is $(5.18 \pm1.62) \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$, which results in an atypically high value of the mass-to-light ratio, 4.35$\pm$1.40 M$_{\odot}$/L$_{V \odot}$. Sextans A GC-1 has varying $\alpha$ elements - the Mg abundance is extremely low ($\text{[Mg/Fe]}=-0.79\pm0.29$), Ca and Ti are solar-scaled or mildly enhanced, and Si is enhanced. This makes the mean $\alpha$ abundance (excluding Mg) to be enhanced. The Fe-peak elements are consistent with scaled-solar or slightly enhanced abundances. Ba and Cu have sub-solar abundance ratios, while Zn and Eu are consistent with their upper limits being solar-scaled and enhanced. The composition of Sextans A GC-1 resembles the overall pattern and behaviour of GCs in the Local Group. The anomalous values are the mass-to-light ratio and the depleted abundance of Mg. There is no definite explanation for such an extreme abundance value. Variations in the initial mass function or the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole might explain the high mass-to-light ratio value.</description>

      <title>FROST-CLUSTERS -- I. Hierarchical star cluster assembly boosts intermediate-mass black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters assemble hierarchically from sub-clusters with a universal power-law cluster mass function. We study the consequences of such assembly for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low metallicities ($Z=0.01\;Z_\mathrm{\odot}$) with our updated N-body code BIFROST based on the hierarchical fourth-order forward integrator. BIFROST integrates few-body systems using secular and regularized techniques including post-Newtonian equations of motion up to order PN3.5 and gravitational-wave recoil kicks for BHs. Single stellar evolution is treated using the fast population synthesis code SEVN. We evolve three cluster assembly regions with $N_\mathrm{tot} = 1.70$--$2.35 \times 10^6$ stars following a realistic IMF in $\sim$1000 sub-clusters for $t=50$ Myr. IMBHs with masses up to $m_\bullet \sim 2200\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ form rapidly mainly via the collapse of very massive stars (VMSs) assembled through repeated collisions of massive stars followed by growth through tidal disruption events and BH mergers. No IMBHs originate from the stars in the initially most massive clusters. We explain this by suppression of hard massive star binary formation at high velocity dispersions and the competition between core collapse and massive star life-times. Later the IMBHs form subsystems resulting in gravitational-wave BH-BH, IMBH-BH and IMBH-IMBH mergers with a $m_\bullet\sim1000\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ gravitational-wave detection being the observable prediction. Our simulations indicate that the hierarchical formation of massive star clusters in metal poor environments naturally results in formation of potential seeds for supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Zooming by in the CARPoolGP lane: new CAMELS-TNG simulations of zoomed-in massive halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation models within cosmological hydrodynamical simulations contain numerous parameters with non-trivial influences over the resulting properties of simulated cosmic structures and galaxy populations. It is computationally challenging to sample these high dimensional parameter spaces with simulations, particularly for halos in the high-mass end of the mass function. In this work, we develop a novel sampling and reduced variance regression method, CARPoolGP, which leverages built-in correlations between samples in different locations of high dimensional parameter spaces to provide an efficient way to explore parameter space and generate low variance emulations of summary statistics. We use this method to extend the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) to include a set of 768 zoom-in simulations of halos in the mass range of $10^{13} - 10^{14.5} M_\odot\,h^{-1}$ that span a 28-dimensional parameter space in the IllustrisTNG model. With these simulations and the CARPoolGP emulation method, we explore parameter trends in the Compton $Y-M$, black hole mass-halo mass, and metallicity-mass relations, as well as thermodynamic profiles and quenched fractions of satellite galaxies. We use these emulations to provide a physical picture of the complex interplay between supernova and active galactic nuclei feedback. We then use emulations of the $Y-M$ relation of massive halos to perform Fisher forecasts on astrophysical parameters for future Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations and find a significant improvement in forecasted constraints. We publicly release both the simulation suite and CARPoolGP software package.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): A first 12-band glimpse of the Fornax galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fornax galaxy cluster is the richest nearby (D ~ 20 Mpc) galaxy association in the southern sky. As such, it provides a wealth of oportunities to elucidate on the processes where environment holds a key role in transforming galaxies. Although it has been the focus of many studies, Fornax has never been explored with contiguous homogeneous wide-field imaging in 12 photometric narrow- and broad-bands like those provided by the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In this paper we present the S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP) that aims to comprehensively analyse the galaxy content of the Fornax cluster using S-PLUS. Our data set consists of 106 S-PLUS wide-field frames (FoV ~ 1.4 x 1.4 deg$^2$) observed in five SDSS-like ugriz broad-bands and seven narrow-bands covering specific spectroscopic features like [OII], CaII H+K, H$\delta$, G-band, Mg b triplet, H$\alpha$, and the CaII triplet. Based on S-PLUS specific automated photometry, aimed at correctly detecting Fornax galaxies and globular clusters in S-PLUS images, our dataset provides the community with catalogues containing homogeneous 12-band photometry for ~ 3 x 10$^6$ resolved and unresolved objects within a region extending over ~ 208 deg$^2$ (~ 5 Rvir in RA) around Fornax' central galaxy, NGC 1399. We further explore the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations to identify 45 Fornax-like clusters and generate mock images on all 12 S-PLUS bands of these structures down to galaxies with M$\star \geq 10^8$ M$\odot$. The S+FP dataset we put forward in this first paper of a series will enable a variety of studies some of which are briefly presented.</description>

      <title>CSST large-scale structure analysis pipeline: I. constructing reference mock galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we set out to construct a set of reference mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs) for the future Chinese Space-station Survey Telescope (CSST) observation, where subsequent survey selection effects can be added and evaluated. This set of MGRSs is generated using the dark matter subhalos extracted from a high-resolution Jiutian $N$-body simulation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony with $\Omega_m=0.3111$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6889$, and $\sigma_8=0.8102$. The simulation has a boxsize of $1~h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$, and consists of $6144^3$ particles with mass resolution $3.723 \times 10^{8} h^{-1} M_\odot $. In order to take into account the effect of redshift evolution, we first use all 128 snapshots in the Jiutian simulation to generate a light-cone halo/subhalo catalog. Next, galaxy luminosities are assigned to the main and subhalo populations using the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) method with the DESI $z$-band luminosity functions at different redshifts. Multi-band photometries, as well as images, are then assigned to each mock galaxy using a 3-dimensional parameter space nearest neighbor sampling of the DESI LS observational galaxies and groups. Finally, the CSST and DESI LS survey geometry and magnitude limit cuts are applied to generate the required MGRSs. As we have checked, this set of MGRSs can generally reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity/mass functions within 0.1 dex for galaxies with $L &gt; 10^8 L_\odot$ (or $M_* &gt; 10^{8.5} M_\odot$) and within 1-$\sigma$ level for galaxies with $L &lt; 10^8L_\odot$ (or $M_* &lt; 10^{8.5} M_\odot$). Together with the CSST slitless spectra and redshifts for our DESI LS seed galaxies that are under construction, we will set out to test various slitless observational selection effects in subsequent probes.</description>

      <title>$Herschel$ investigation of cores and filamentary structures in L1251 located in the Cepheus flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Molecular clouds are the prime locations of star formation. These clouds contain filamentary structures and cores which are crucial in the formation of young stars. Aims: In this work, we aim to quantify the physical properties of structural characteristics within the molecular cloud L1251 to better understand the initial conditions for star formation. Methods: We applied the getsf algorithm to identify cores and filaments within the molecular cloud L1251 using the Herschel multiband dust continuum image, enabling us to measure their respective physical properties. Additionally, we utilized an enhanced differential term algorithm to produce high-resolution temperature maps and column density maps with a resolution of ${13.5}''$. Results: We identified 122 cores in the region. Out of them, 23 are protostellar cores, 13 are robust prestellar cores, 32 are candidate prestellar cores (including 13 robust prestellar cores and 19 strictly candidate prestellar cores), and 67 are unbound starless cores. getsf also found 147 filament structures in the region. Statistical analysis of the physical properties (mass (M), temperature (T), size, and core brightness (hereafter, we are using the word luminosity (L)) for the core brightness) of obtained cores shows a negative correlation between core mass and temperature and a positive correlation between (M/L) and (M/T). Analysis of the filaments gives a median width of 0.14 pc and no correlation between width and length. Out of those 122 cores, 92 are present in filaments (75.4%) and the remaining were outside them. Out of the cores present in filaments, 57 (62%) cores are present in supercritical filaments ($M_{\rm line}&gt;16M_{\odot }/{\rm pc}$).</description>

      <title>A sample of 25 radio galaxies with highly unusual radio morphologies, selected from the LoTSS-DR2 survey at 144 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a careful visual scrutiny of the radio structures of a well-defined sample of 2428 sources in the LoTSS DR2 survey made at 144 MHz with a 6" beam, we have selected a subset of 25 (i.e., 1%) sources showing highly unusual radio structures, not conforming to the prevalent radio morphological classification. Here we present and briefly discuss the basic properties of these rare morphological outliers and attempt to dissect their morphological peculiarities, based on multi-wavelength radio images and radio-optical overlays. Also, we underscore the need to accord due importance to such anomalous radio sources, considering the challenge they pose to the standard theoretical models and simulations of extragalactic double radio sources.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Mechanical and Radiative Feedback in J1044+0353 with KCWI Spectral Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integral field spectroscopy toward and around J1044+0353, a rapidly growing, low-metallicity galaxy which produces extreme [O III] line emission. A new map of the O32 flux ratio reveals a density-bounded ionization cone emerging from the starburst. The interaction of the hydrogen ionizing radiation, produced by the very young starburst, with a cavity previously carved out by a galactic outflow, whose apex lies well outside the starburst region, determines the pathway for global Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. In the region within a few hundred parsecs of the young starburst, we demonstrate that superbubble breakthrough and blowout contribute distinct components to the [O III] line profile, broad and very-broad emission line wings, respectively. We draw attention to the large [O III] luminosity of the broad component and argue that this emission comes from photoionized, superbubble shells rather than a galactic wind as is often assumed. The spatially resolved H eII 4686 nebula appears to be photoionized by young star clusters. Stellar wind emission from these stars is likely the source of line wings detected on the He II line profile. This broader He II component indicates slow stellar winds, consistent with an increase in stellar rotation (and a decrease in effective escape speed) at the metallicity of J1044+0353. At least in J1044+0353, the recent star formation history plays a critical role in generating a global pathway for LyC escape, and the anisotropic escape would likely be missed by direct observations of the LyC.</description>

      <title>The rate and contribution of mergers to mass assembly from NIRCam observations of galaxy candidates up to 13.3 billion years ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the galaxy merger rate in the redshift range $4.0&lt;z&lt;9.0$ (i.e. about 1.5 to 0.5 Gyr after the Big Bang) based on visually identified galaxy mergers from morphological parameter analysis. Our dataset is based on high-resolution NIRCam JWST data (F150W and F2000W broad-band filters) in the low-to-moderate magnification ($\mu&lt;2$) regions of the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a parent set of 675 galaxies $(M_{UV}\in[-26.6,-17.9])$, we identify 64 merger candidates from the Gini, $M_{20}$ and Asymmetry morphological parameters, leading to a merger fraction $f_m=0.11\pm0.04$. There is no evidence of redshift evolution of $f_m$ even at the highest redshift considered, thus extending well into the epoch of reionization the constant trend seen previously at $z\lesssim 6$. Furthermore, we investigate any potential redshift dependent differences in the specific star formation rates between mergers and non-mergers. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation in this regard, with deviations in the studied redshift range typically falling within $0.25$ dex (logarithmic scale) that can be attributed to sample variance and measurement errors. Finally, we also demonstrate that the classification of a merging system is robust with respect to the observed (and equivalently rest-frame) wavelength of the high-quality JWST broad-band images used. This preliminary study highlights the potential for progress in quantifying galaxy assembly through mergers during the epoch of reionization, with significant sample size growth expected from upcoming large JWST infrared imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>Probing cold gas with Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg II resonance doublet at 2796 {\AA} and 2803 {\AA} is an increasingly important tool to study cold, $T \sim 10^{4}\,$K, gas -- an observational driven development requiring theoretical support. We develop a new Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to systematically study the joined Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ escape through homogeneous and `clumpy' multiphase gas with dust in arbitrary 3D geometries. Our main findings are: (i) The Mg II spectrum differs from Ly$\alpha$ due to the large difference in column densities, even though the atomic physics of the two lines are similar. (ii) the Mg II escape fraction is generally higher than that of Ly$\alpha$ because of lower dust optical depths and path lengths -- but large variations due to differences in dust models and the clumpiness of the cold medium exist. (iii) Clumpy media possess a `critical covering factor' above which Mg II radiative transfer matches a homogeneous medium. The critical covering factors for Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ differ, allowing constraints on the cold gas structure. (iv) The Mg II doublet ratio $R_{\rm MgII}$ varies for strong outflows/inflows ($\gtrsim 700 \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), in particular, $R_{\rm MgII}&lt;1$ being an unambiguous tracer for powerful galactic winds. (v) Scattering of stellar continuum photons can decrease $R_{\rm MgII}$ from two to one, allowing constraints on the scattering medium. Notably, we introduce a novel probe of the cold gas column density -- the halo doublet ratio -- which we show to be a powerful indicator of ionizing photon escape. We discuss our results in the context of interpreting and modeling observations as well as their implications for other resonant doublets.</description>

      <title>Effects of galaxy environment on merger fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11615</link>

Abstract: Aims. In this work, we intend to examine how environment influences the merger fraction, from the low density field environment to higher density groups and clusters. We also aim to study how the properties of a group or cluster, as well as the position of a galaxy in the group or cluster, influences the merger fraction.
  Methods. We identified galaxy groups and clusters in the North Ecliptic Pole using a friends-of-friends algorithm and the local density. Once identified, we determined the central galaxies, group radii, velocity dispersions, and group masses of these groups and clusters. Merging systems were identified with a neural network as well as visually. With these, we examined how the merger fraction changes as the local density changes for all galaxies as well as how the merger fraction changes as the properties of the groups or clusters change.
  Results. We find that the merger fraction increases as local density increases and decreases as the velocity dispersion increases, as is often found in literature. A decrease in merger fraction as the group mass increases is also found. We also find groups with larger radii have higher merger fractions. The number of galaxies in a group does not influence the merger fraction.
  Conclusions. The decrease in merger fraction as group mass increases is a result of the link between group mass and velocity dispersion. Hence, this decrease of merger fraction with increasing mass is a result of the decrease of merger fraction with velocity dispersion. The increasing relation between group radii and merger fraction may be a result of larger groups having smaller velocity dispersion at a larger distance from the centre or larger groups hosting smaller, infalling groups with more mergers. However, we do not find evidence of smaller groups having higher merger fractions.</description>

      <title>GLACE survey: OSIRIS/GTC tuneable imaging of the galaxy cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 II. The mass--metallicity relationship and the effect of the environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the data for the galaxy cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 provided by the GLACE survey and study the mass--metallicity function and its relationship with the environment. Here we describe an alternative way to reduce the data from OSIRIS tunable filters. This method gives us better uncertainties in the fluxes of the emission lines and the derived quantities. We present an updated catalogue of cluster galaxies with emission in H$\alpha$ and [N\,{\sc{ii}}] $\lambda\lambda$6548,6583. We also discuss the biases of these new fluxes and describe the way in which we calculated the mass--metallicity relationship and its uncertainties. We generated a new catalogue of 84 emission-line galaxies with reliable fluxes in [N\,{\sc{ii}}] and H$\alpha$ lines from a list of 174 galaxies. We find a relationship between the clustercentric radius and the density of galaxies. We derived the mass--metallicity relationship for ZwCl 0024.0+1652 and compared it with clusters and field galaxies from the literature. We find a difference in the mass--metallicity relationship when compared to more massive clusters, with the latter showing on average higher values of abundance. This could be an effect of the quenching of the star formation, which seems to be more prevalent in low-mass galaxies in more massive clusters. We find little to no difference between ZwCl 0024.0+1652 galaxies and field galaxies located at the same redshift.</description>

      <title>The temperature of the neutral Interstellar Medium in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic Hydrogen-21 cm transition (HI) is an excellent tracer to study and understand the properties of the atomic gas in the Galaxy. Using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), we observed 12 quasar sightlines to detect galactic HI in absorption. We achieve an optical depth RMS of $\sim 1-2 \times 10^{-3}$, essential to detect the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM). We detect HI absorption in all our sightlines except along 1006+349, for which we set a strict upper limit on the spin temperature as $\langle T_s \rangle &gt; 570$ K. We find around 50\% of our sightlines have $\langle T_s \rangle &gt; 500$ K, indicating a WNM dominance. Further, we calculate an upper limit of the CNM fraction along our sightlines and find a median CNM fraction of $\sim 0.12$. With our observations, we reconfirm the existence of a threshold column density of $\sim 2 \times 10^{20} \ cm^{-2}$ to form CNM in the ISM. Using a two-temperature model of the HI disk, we explore the distribution of spin temperature in the Galactic ISM. We find that a simple fixed axisymmetric two-temperature model could not produce either the observed column density or the integral optical depth. This indicates the existence of a more complex distribution of spin temperatures in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>ARTEMIS emulator: exploring the effect of cosmology and galaxy formation physics on Milky Way-mass haloes and their satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the new ARTEMIS emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes' stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spot properties on 32 periodic young stellar objects in IC 5070. Long term, $\sim$5 yr, light curves in the $V$, $R$, and $I$-bands are obtained through the HOYS (Hunting Outbursting Young Stars) citizen science project. These are dissected into six months long slices, with 3 months oversampling, to measure 234 sets of amplitudes in all filters. We fit 180 of these with reliable spot solutions. Two thirds of spot solutions are cold spots, the lowest is 2150 K below the stellar temperature. One third are warm spots that are above the stellar temperature by less than $\sim$2000 K. Cold and warm spots have maximum surface coverage values of 40 percent, although only 16 percent of warm spots are above 20 percent surface coverage as opposed to 60 percent of the cold spots. Warm spots are most likely caused by a combination of plages and low density accretion columns, most common on objects without inner disc excess emission in $K-W2$. Five small hot spot solutions have $&lt;3$ percent coverage and are 3000 - 5000 K above the stellar temperature. These are attributed to accretion, and four of them occur on the same object. The majority of our objects are likely to be accreting. However, we observe very few accretion hot spots as either the accretion is not stable on our timescale or the photometry is dominated by other features. We do not identify cyclical spot behaviour on the targets. We additionally identify and discuss a number of objects that have interesting amplitudes, phase changes, or spot properties.</description>

      <title>Debiasing with Diffusion: Probabilistic reconstruction of Dark Matter fields from galaxies with CAMELS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying cosmic web, which is dominated by dark matter components that cannot be directly observed. Galaxy formation simulations can be used to study the relationship between dark matter density fields and galaxy distributions. However, this relationship can be sensitive to assumptions in cosmology and astrophysical processes embedded in the galaxy formation models, that remain uncertain in many aspects. In this work, we develop a diffusion generative model to reconstruct dark matter fields from galaxies. The diffusion model is trained on the CAMELS simulation suite that contains thousands of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations with varying cosmological parameters and sub-grid astrophysics. We demonstrate that the diffusion model can predict the unbiased posterior distribution of the underlying dark matter fields from the given stellar mass fields, while being able to marginalize over uncertainties in cosmological and astrophysical models. Interestingly, the model generalizes to simulation volumes approximately 500 times larger than those it was trained on, and across different galaxy formation models. Code for reproducing these results can be found at https://github.com/victoriaono/variational-diffusion-cdm</description>

      <title>Multiple Outflows around a Single Protostar IRAS 15398$-$3359</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our mosaic observations of a single Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398$-$3359 with Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in the CO $J=2\mbox{-}1$ line. The new observations covering a $\sim\!2'$ square region revealed elongated redshifted and blueshifted components, which are located at distances of $\sim\!30''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northern and southern sides of the protostar, respectively, in addition to the previously observed primary and secondary outflows. These elongated components exhibit Hubble-law like velocity structures, i.e., an increase of velocity with increasing distance from the protostar, suggesting that it is the third outflow associated with the protostar. Besides, a new redshifted component is detected at radii of $\sim\!40''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northwestern side of the protostar. This redshifted component also exhibits a Hubble-law like velocity profile, which could be the counterpart of the secondary outflow mostly detected at blueshifted velocities in a previous study. The three outflows are all misaligned by $\sim\!20\mbox{-}90^\circ$, and the dynamical timescale of the primary outflow is shorter than those of the other outflows approximately by an order of magnitude. These facts hint that the outflow launch direction has significantly changed with time. The outflow direction may change if the rotational axis and the magnetic field are misaligned, or if the dense core is turbulent. We favor the second scenario as the origin of the multiple outflows in IRAS 15398$-$3359 based on a comparison between the observational results and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>SDSS~J075217.84+193542.2: X-ray weighing of a secondary BH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of black hole (BHs) masses are necessary to understand the coevolution of these sources and their host galaxies. Sometimes in the center of a galaxy there is not one, but two BHs. The BH duality of the quasar nucleus SDSS~J075217.84+193542.2 (herein SDSS~J0752) was recently proposed based on the observed strict periodicity of optical emission from the source. We tested this assumption using X-ray observations with Swift/XRT (2008--2010). We fitted the SDSS~J075217 spectrum using a Comptonization model and discovered soft X-ray variability in the 0.3--10~keV energy range. We pursued a scenario in which two supermassive BHs at the center of SDSS~J0752 form a pair; and the less massive (secondary) BH periodically crosses/punctures the disk around the more massive (primary) BH. We associate these periodic crossings with tidal disruptions of the disk and, as a consequence, with an increase in X-rays seen as a flare in SDSS~J0752. During such an X-ray flare event (2008--2010), we discovered a change in the source spectral states and the photon index saturation at the $\Gamma\sim3$ level with mass accretion rate $\dot M$. For BH mass scaling we used sources: OJ~287, M101 ULX--1 and HLX--1 ESO~243--49, as a reference ones, and found that M$_{SDSS}=9\times 10^7$ solar masses, assuming $d_{SDSS}= 500$ Mpc. Thus, we obtained a lower limit to a BH mass due the unknown inclination. In addition, we used the virial mass of the secondary BH based on $H_\alpha$-line measurements and we estimated the binary's inclination at SDSS~J0752, $i=80^{\circ}$, using a scaling technique.</description>

      <title>s-process Enriched Evolved Binaries in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds</title>

Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch stars (post-AGB) in binary systems, with typical orbital periods between ~100 to ~1000 days, result from a poorly understood interaction that terminates their precursory AGB phase. The majority of these binaries display a photospheric anomaly called 'chemical depletion', thought to arise from an interaction between the circumbinary disc and the post-AGB star, leading to the reaccretion of pure gas onto the star, devoid of refractory elements due to dust formation. In this paper, we focus on a subset of chemically peculiar binary post-AGBs in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) whose high-resolution optical spectroscopic study revealed a carbon and s-process enrichment, contrary to the commonly observed photospheric chemical depletion. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and period-luminosity-colour (PLC) relation methods, we determine the luminosity of the targets ($2700-8300L_{\odot}$), which enables confirmation of their evolutionary phase and estimation of initial masses (as a function of metallicity) ($1-2.5M_{\odot}$). In conjunction with predictions from dedicated ATON stellar evolutionary models, our results indicate a predominant intrinsic enrichment of carbon and s-process elements in our binary post-AGB targets. We qualitatively rule out extrinsic enrichment and inherited s-process enrichment from the host galaxy as plausible explanations for the observed overabundances. Our chemically peculiar subset of intrinsic carbon and s-process enriched binary post-AGBs also hints at potential variation in the efficiency of chemical depletion between stars with C-rich and O-rich circumbinary disc chemistries. However, critical observational studies of circumbinary disc chemistry are necessary to address gaps in our current understanding of disc-binary interactions inducing chemical depletion in binary post-AGB systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical lens mass model parameters, even though the simplest singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models yield a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom $\simeq 2$. To date, this problem has been alleviated by introducing additional empirical parameters in the extended power law (EPL) models and constraints from high resolution imagery. The EPL parameters are taken to vary from lens to lens, rather than defining universal lens profiles. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW Timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) to simulate large mock catalogues for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the Timescape model. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to any cosmological model. In agreement with previous results we find that in combination with SIS parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\rm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the Timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73$ matches, close to values found to best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for Timescape fits to both Timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with non-FLRW spatial curvature evolution.</description>

Abstract: Stars move away from their birthplaces over time via a process known as radial migration, which blurs chemo-kinematic relations used for reconstructing the Milky Way (MW) formation history. To understand the true time evolution of the MW, one needs to take into account the effects of this process. We show that stellar birth radii can be derived directly from the data with minimum prior assumptions on the Galactic enrichment history. This is done by first recovering the time evolution of the stellar birth metallicity gradient, $d\mathrm{[Fe/H]}(R, \tau)/dR$, through its inverse relation to the metallicity range as a function of age today, allowing us to place any star with age and metallicity measurements back to its birthplace, $R_b$. Applying our method to a large, high-precision data set of MW disk subgiant stars, we find a steepening of the birth metallicity gradient from 11 to 8 Gyr ago, which coincides with the time of the last massive merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). This transition appears to play a major role in shaping both the age-metallicity relation and the bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. By dissecting the disk into mono-$R_b$ populations, clumps in the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence appear, which are not seen in the total sample and coincide in time with known star-formation bursts, possibly associated with the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. We estimated that the Sun was born at $4.5\pm 0.4$~kpc from the Galactic center. Our $R_b$ estimates provide the missing piece needed to recover the Milky Way formation history.</description>

      <title>Stellar cluster formation in a Milky Way-sized galaxy at z&gt;4 -- II. A hybrid formation scenario for the nuclear star cluster and its connection to the nuclear stellar ring</title>

Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in the innermost region of most galaxies. While recent studies suggest that low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and NSCs in massive galaxies accumulate mass primarily through central star formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way's NSC is still uncertain. In this work, we use GigaEris, a high resolution N-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation, to investigate a possible formation path of the NSC in the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly and evolution of the galactic nuclear region. We study the possibility that bound, young, gas-rich, stellar clusters within a radius of 1.5 kpc of the main galaxy's centre at z&gt;4 are the predecessors of the old, metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way's NSC. We identify 47 systems which satisfy our criteria, with a total stellar mass of $10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that both stellar cluster accretion and in-situ star formation will contribute to the formation of the NSC, providing evidence for a hybrid formation scenario for the first time in an N-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation. Additionally, we find that the gas required for in-situ star formation can originate from two pathways: gas-rich stellar clusters and gas influx driven by large-scale non-axisymmetric structures within the galaxy. This is partly supported by the presence of a stellar ring, resulting from gas dynamics, with properties similar to those of the Milky Way's nuclear stellar disc.</description>

      <title>Quaia, the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog: An All-Sky Spectroscopic Quasar Sample</title>

Abstract: We present a new, all-sky quasar catalog, Quaia, that samples the largest comoving volume of any existing spectroscopic quasar sample. The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory's low-resolution BP/RP spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18% of even the bright ($G&lt;20.0$) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates ($|\Delta z/(1+z)|&gt;0.2$) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and Gaia and unWISE colors, reducing the number of contaminants by $\sim$4$\times$. We improve the redshifts by training a $k$-nearest neighbors model on SDSS redshifts, and achieve estimates on the $G&lt;20.0$ sample with only 6% (10%) catastrophic errors with $|\Delta z/(1+z)|&gt;0.2$ ($0.1$), a reduction of $\sim$3$\times$ ($\sim$2$\times$) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with $G&lt;20.5$, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner $G&lt;20.0$ sample, with accompanying rigorous selection function models. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses. The catalog is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/10403370.</description>

      <title>Looking for a needle in a haystack: Measuring the length of a stellar bar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the challenges related to stellar bars is to accurately determine the length of the bar in a disc galaxy. In the literature, a wide variety of methods have been employed to measure the extent of a bar. However, a systematic study on determining the robustness and accuracy of different bar length estimators is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the accuracy and the correlation (if any) between different bar length measurement methods while using an N-body model of a barred galaxy, where the bar evolves self-consistently in the presence of a live dark matter halo. We investigate the temporal evolution of the bar length, using different estimators (involving isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution and Fourier decomposition of surface density), and we study their robustness and accuracy. We made further attempts to determine correlations among any two of these bar length estimators used here. In the presence of spirals, the bar length estimators that only consider the amplitudes of different Fourier moments (and do not take into account the phase-angle of m=2 Fourier moment) systematically overestimate the length of the bar. The strength of dark-gaps (produced by bars) is strongly correlated with the bar length in early rapid growth phase and is only weakly anti-correlated during subsequent quiescent phase of bar evolution. However, the location of dark-gaps is only weakly correlated to the bar length, hence, this information cannot be used as a robust proxy for determining the bar length. In addition, the bar length estimators, obtained using isophotal analysis of de-projected surface brightness distribution, systematically overestimate the bar length. The implications of bar length over(under)estimation in the context of determining fast and slow bars are further discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>EDGE -- Dark matter or astrophysics? Breaking dark matter heating degeneracies with HI rotation in faint dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-mass dwarf galaxies are expected to reside within dark matter haloes that have a pristine, `cuspy' density profile within their stellar half-light radii. This is because they form too few stars to significantly drive dark matter heating through supernova-driven outflows. Here, we study such simulated faint systems ($10^4 \leq M_{\star} \leq 2\times 10^6 \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$) drawn from high-resolution (3 pc) cosmological simulations from the `Engineering Dwarf Galaxies at the Edge of galaxy formation' (EDGE) project. We confirm that these objects have steep and rising inner dark matter density profiles at $z=0$, little affected by galaxy formation effects. But five dwarf galaxies from the suite also showcase a detectable HI reservoir ($M_{\mathrm{HI}}\approx 10^{5}-10^{6} \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$), analogous to the observed population of faint, HI-bearing dwarf galaxies. These reservoirs exhibit episodes of ordered rotation, opening windows for rotation curve analysis. Within actively star-forming dwarfs, stellar feedback easily disrupts the tenuous HI discs ($v_{\phi} \approx 10\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), making rotation short-lived ($\ll 150 \, \mathrm{Myr}$) and more challenging to interpret for dark matter inferences. In contrast, we highlight a long-lived ($\geq 500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$) and easy-to-interpret HI rotation curve extending to $\approx 2\, r_{1/2, \text{3D}}$ in a quiescent dwarf, that has not formed new stars since $z=4$. This stable gas disc is supported by an oblate dark matter halo shape that drives high-angular momentum gas flows. Our results strongly motivate further searches for HI in rotation curves in the observed population of HI-bearing low-mass dwarfs, that provide a key regime to disentangle the respective roles of dark matter microphysics and galaxy formation effects in driving dark matter heating.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.07\pm0.20$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.49^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+2}_{-1}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.52^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$14\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.59 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with non-H$\alpha$ emitter galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Dragonfly Galaxy II. Young, radiatively efficient radio-loud AGN drives massive molecular outflow in a starburst merger at z=1.92</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) are a unique AGN population and were thought to be preferentially associated with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at low accretion rates. They could impact the host galaxy evolution by expelling cold gas through the jet-mode feedback. In this work, we studied CO(6-5) line emission in a high-redshift radio galaxy, MRC 0152-209, at z=1.92 using ALMA up to a $0.024''$-resolution (corresponding to ~200 pc). This system is a starburst major merger constituted of two galaxies: the northwest (NW) one hosting the RLAGN with jet kinetic power $L_{\rm jet}\gtrsim2\times10^{46}$ erg/s and the southeast (SE) one. Based on the SED fitting for the entire system (NW+SE galaxies), we found AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm AGN,bol}\sim(0.9-3)\times10^{46}$ erg/s for the RLAGN. We estimated BH mass through $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations and found an Eddington ratio of $\sim0.7-4$ conservatively. These results suggest that the RLAGN is radiatively efficient and the powerful jets could be launched from a super-Eddington accretion disc. ALMA reveals a massive ($M_{\rm H_2}\sim2\times10^9$ Msun), compact ($\sim500$ pc), and lopsided molecular outflow perpendicular to the jet axis. The mass outflow rate (~1200-2600 Msun/yr) is comparable with the star formation rate of ~2000-3000 Msun/yr. The outflow kinetic power/$L_{\rm AGN,bol}$ ratio of ~0.008-0.02 and momentum boost factor ~3-24 agree with the radiative-mode AGN feedback. On the other hand, the jets can also drive the molecular outflow within its lifetime of $\sim2\times10^5$ yr without additional energy supply from AGN radiation. The jets then could remove all cold gas from the host galaxy through long-term, episodic launching. Our study reveals a unique object where starburst, powerful jets, and rapid BH growth co-exist, which may represent a fundamental stage of AGN-host galaxy co-evolution.</description>

      <title>Hungry or Not: How Stellar-Mass Black Holes Grow (or Don't) in Dark Matter Mini-Haloes at High-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the performance of the popular Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme with a simple mass-flux scheme applied to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) across six levels of increasing spatial resolution. Simulating the formation of black holes within cosmological mini-haloes at $z \sim 20$, we investigate scenarios both with and without supernova events, which result in BHs of initial mass $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ respectively. Our explicit focus on the stellar-mass range pushes the maximum resolution down to sub-$10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$ regimes, where more complicated gas dynamics are resolved. We observe efficient growth and rotationally supported, $\sim$$10^{-1} \, \text{pc}$-scale discs around all $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs independent of resolution and accretion scheme, though clumps, bars, and spiral arm structures impact stability at high resolution. We analyse the effect of these instabilities on the accretion cycle. In contrast, all bar one of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs fail to attract a disc and experience modest growth, even when characteristic scales of accretion and dynamical friction are reasonably resolved. While the two accretion schemes somewhat converge in mass growth for the $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ case over $1 \, \text{Myr}$, the greater degree of gas fragmentation induces more randomness in the evolution of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs. We conclude that early universe black holes of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^1 \, \text{M}_\odot$ struggle to grow even in gas-rich environments without feedback in comparison to seeds of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^2 \, \text{M}_\odot$, and the latter exhibit convergent growth histories across accretion schemes below a spatial resolution of $1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$.</description>

      <title>Gas Dynamical Friction on Accreting Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker (1999) derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front-back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with the Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way reducing the dynamical friction compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>The MASSIVE survey -- XIX. Molecular gas measurements of the supermassive black hole masses in the elliptical galaxies NGC 1684 and NGC 0997</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses can be measured by observing their dynamical effects on tracers, such as molecular gas. We present high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) line emission of the early-type galaxies (ETGs) NGC 1684 and NGC 0997, obtained as part of the MASSIVE survey, a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic study of the most massive local ETGs. NGC 1684 has a regularly-rotating central molecular gas disc, with a spatial extent of $\approx 6 "$ ($\approx1.8$ kpc) in radius and a central hole slightly larger than the expected SMBH sphere of influence. We forward model the data cube in a Bayesian framework with the Kinematic Molecular Simulation (KinMS) code and infer a SMBH mass of $1.40^{+0.44}_{-0.39}\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ ($3\sigma$ confidence interval) and a F110W-filter stellar mass-to-light ratio of $(2.50\pm0.05)$ M$_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F110W}}$. NGC 0997 has a regularly-rotating central molecular gas disc, with a spatial extent of $\approx5 "$ ($\approx2.2$ kpc) in radius and a partially-filled central hole much larger than the expected SMBH sphere of influence, thus preventing a robust SMBH mass determination. With the same modelling method, we nevertheless constrain the SMBH mass to be in the range $4.0\times10^7$ to $1.8\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ and the F160W-filter stellar mass-to-light ratio to be $(1.52\pm0.11)$ M$_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}$. Both SMBH masses are consistent with the SMBH mass -- stellar velocity dispersion ($M_{\text{BH}}$ -- $\sigma_\text{e}$) relation, suggesting that the over-massive SMBHs present in other very massive ETGs are fairly uncommon.</description>

Abstract: A detailed measurement is made of the metallicity distributions, kinematics and dynamics of the thin and thick disks, across a large disk volume (5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars. The metallicity distributions results show that the radial metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R of the thin disk weakens with $|Z|$ from $-$0.06 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&lt;$ 0.25 kpc to $-$0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around $|Z|$ $&gt;$ 2.75 kpc, while the thick disk displays a global weak positive $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R, generally weaker than 0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$. The vertical metallicity gradient $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ weakened steadily from $-$0.36 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $R$ $\sim$ 5.5 kpc to $-$0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ at around R $&gt;$ 11.5 kpc for the thin disk, while the thick disk presents an almost constant value (nearly $-$0.06 $\sim$ $-$0.08 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for all the $R$ bins. These results indicate the contribution of the radial migration to the disk evolution, and the obvious north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may be linked to the disk warp and/or the disk perturbation events. The oscillations of the corrected $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ with $R$ are likely because of the resonances with the Galactic Bar. Our detailed measurements of $\Delta$V$_{\phi}$/$\Delta$[Fe/H] indicate an "inside-out" and "upside-down" star formation scenario for the thick disk. The results of eccentricity distributions and [$\alpha$/Fe]--velocity dispersion relations are likely to suggest that the thick disk stars require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Dark Dragon Breaks Magnetic Chain: Dynamical Substructures of IRDC G28.34 Form in Supported Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have comprehensively studied the multi-scale physical properties of the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14m, JCMT, and ALMA. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), and modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis, we find that: G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic environment ($\mathcal{M}_{A}=0.74$ within $r=15$ pc); the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions; and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with increasing density and decreasing radius. Considering the thermal, turbulent, and magnetic supports, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a super-virial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a sub-virial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work, we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealized DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time-scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density, and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.</description>

Abstract: Large-amplitude accretion outbursts in young stars are expected to play a central role in proto-stellar assembly. Outburst identification historically has taken place using optical techniques, but over the past decade especially, systematic infrared searches have also become possible with increasing discovery of outburst events located in heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galactic plane. Here, we present the discovery of WTP10aaauow, a large-amplitude mid-infrared (MIR) outburst identified in a systematic search of NEOWISE data using image subtraction techniques designed to recover transients in dense Galactic stellar fields. The new outburst is located towards the RCW 49 star-forming region, and estimated to be at a distance of $\approx4$ kpc via Gaia parallax measurement. Concurrent with the MIR brightening by which it was discovered, we show that the source underwent a $\sim5$ mag outburst in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands as well. WTP10aaauow reached a peak luminosity of $\approx260$ L$_\odot$ in 2014-2015, followed by a slow decline over the next 7 years. Analysis of the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions reveal a pre-outburst stellar photosphere at a temperature of $3600-4000$ K, surrounded by a likely two-component dust structure similar to that of a flat spectrum or Class I type YSO. We present optical and NIR follow-up spectroscopy of the source, that show a GK-type spectrum in the optical bands exhibiting complex line profiles in strong absorption features, and evidence for a wind reaching a terminal velocity of $\approx 400$ km s$^{-1}$. The NIR bands are characterized by a cooler M-type spectrum exhibiting a forest of atomic and molecular features. All together, the spectra demonstrate that WTP10aaauow is an FU Ori type outburst. Ongoing systematic infrared searches will continue to reveal the extent of this population in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Strong Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation in Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1</title>

Abstract: Very recent work has identified a new satellite galaxy, Ursa Major III/UNIONS I, which is the faintest such system ever observed. Dynamical considerations indicate that if the system is in equilibrium, it is likely to be highly dark matter dominated. This, in combination with its proximity, predicts that it may be the preeminent dwarf spheroidal galaxy target for dark matter indirect detection searches. We utilize 15 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for $\gamma$-ray emission from Ursa Major III. Finding no excess, we set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation. Intriguingly, if the high J-factor of Ursa Major III is confirmed, standard thermal dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states would be ruled out for dark matter masses up to 4 TeV. The discovery of Ursa Major III, combined with recent tentative measurements of other high J-factor systems, suggests the exciting possibility that near-future data could produce transformative constraints on thermal dark matter.</description>
