      <title>Robotic Fire Risk Detection based on Dynamic Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Approach with Graph Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph (IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.</description>

      <title>U2UData-2: A Scalable Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight Dataset for Long-horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData-2 can be found at https://fengtt42.github.io/U2UData-2/.</description>

      <title>Correspondence-Free, Function-Based Sim-to-Real Learning for Deformable Surface Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network -- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators.</description>

      <title>OpenTie: Open-vocabulary Sequential Rebar Tying System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap, we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that the effectiveness of the system in practice.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Perception and Equivariant Diffusion for Robust Multi-Node Rebar Tying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk. Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and labor efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</description>

      <title>Poke and Strike: Learning Task-Informed Exploration Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution, ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time. Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.</description>

      <title>First Order Model-Based RL through Decoupled Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>Learn from What We HAVE: History-Aware VErifier that Reasons about Past Interactions Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality. Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over baselines.

      <title>TReF-6: Inferring Task-Relevant Frames from a Single Demonstration for One-Shot Skill Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work, we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure, extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs, referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph, which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence, TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii) bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of challenges in the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aided Navigation of Flexible Robotic Endoscope Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic interpretability for steering vision-language-action models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.</description>

      <title>Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Aggregate Sorting in Construction and Mining via Computer Vision-Aided Robotic Arm Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often suffer from low precision, limited flexibility, and poor adaptability to diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework. Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment. Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy. Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.</description>

      <title>Generative Visual Foresight Meets Task-Agnostic Pose Estimation in Robotic Table-Top Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames, translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop, GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for intelligent robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Embodied Spatial Intelligence: from Implicit Scene Modeling to Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts: scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust, scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex, language-based commands.</description>

      <title>Extended Diffeomorphism for Real-Time Motion Replication in Workspaces with Different Spatial Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces. Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace. Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth replicated movement.</description>

      <title>FLUID: A Fine-Grained Lightweight Urban Signalized-Intersection Dataset of Dense Conflict Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</description>

      <title>NeuralSVCD for Efficient Swept Volume Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning. Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points, whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory. Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off. Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SVCD methods in terms of both collision detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios.

      <title>Needle Biopsy And Fiber-Optic Compatible Robotic Insertion Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning of Dolly-In Filming Using a Ground-Based Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-roaming dollies enhance filmmaking with dynamic movement, but challenges in automated camera control remain unresolved. Our study advances this field by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automate dolly-in shots using free-roaming ground-based filming robots, overcoming traditional control hurdles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combined control for precise film tasks by comparing it to independent control strategies. Our robust RL pipeline surpasses traditional Proportional-Derivative controller performance in simulation and proves its efficacy in real-world tests on a modified ROSBot 2.0 platform equipped with a camera turret. This validates our approach's practicality and sets the stage for further research in complex filming scenarios, contributing significantly to the fusion of technology with cinematic creativity. This work presents a leap forward in the field and opens new avenues for research and development, effectively bridging the gap between technological advancement and creative filmmaking.</description>

      <title>ConceptBot: Enhancing Robot's Autonomy through Task Decomposition with Large Language Models and Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ConceptBot is a modular robotic planning framework that combines Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs to generate feasible and risk-aware plans despite ambiguities in natural language instructions and correctly analyzing the objects present in the environment - challenges that typically arise from a lack of commonsense reasoning. To do that, ConceptBot integrates (i) an Object Property Extraction (OPE) module that enriches scene understanding with semantic concepts from ConceptNet, (ii) a User Request Processing (URP) module that disambiguates and structures instructions, and (iii) a Planner that generates context-aware, feasible pick-and-place policies. In comparative evaluations against Google SayCan, ConceptBot achieved 100% success on explicit tasks, maintained 87% accuracy on implicit tasks (versus 31% for SayCan), reached 76% on risk-aware tasks (versus 15%), and outperformed SayCan in application-specific scenarios, including material classification (70% vs. 20%) and toxicity detection (86% vs. 36%). On SafeAgentBench, ConceptBot achieved an overall score of 80% (versus 46% for the next-best baseline). These results, validated in both simulation and laboratory experiments, demonstrate ConceptBot's ability to generalize without domain-specific training and to significantly improve the reliability of robotic policies in unstructured environments.

      <title>Gray-Box Computed Torque Control for Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.</description>

      <title>Learning Dolly-In Filming From Demonstration Using a Ground-Based Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry - qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust, reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive, stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments. All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Lane-Changing for Autonomous Vehicles: An Improved Double Quintic Polynomial Approach with Time-to-Collision Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) Method for Developing and Evaluating VRU Safety of Connected and Autonomous Driving with Focus on Bicyclist Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous year results while also considering bicyclist safety.</description>

      <title>A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</description>

      <title>CARIS: A Context-Adaptable Robot Interface System for Personalized and Scalable Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics, human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one context, making them less adaptable across different settings, users, and robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly available, context-adaptable tool for the HRI community, enabling researchers to streamline data-driven approaches to intelligent robot behavior.</description>

      <title>DyPho-SLAM : Real-time Photorealistic SLAM in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual SLAM algorithms have been enhanced through the exploration of Gaussian Splatting representations, particularly in generating high-fidelity dense maps. While existing methods perform reliably in static environments, they often encounter camera tracking drift and fuzzy mapping when dealing with the disturbances caused by moving objects. This paper presents DyPho-SLAM, a real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image information to generate refined masks, effectively minimizing noise from mask misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and dense map reconstruction, while operating in real-time in dynamic scenes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Kinematics for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator Using Comprehensive Gr\"obner Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments.</description>

      <title>An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</description>

      <title>One-Step Model Predictive Path Integral for Manipulator Motion Planning Using Configuration Space Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints. However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for high-dimensional motion planning.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Mean Field Game for Interactive Decision-Making with Varied Stylish Multi-Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model. To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins, time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two 15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>A Robust Numerical Method for Solving Trigonometric Equations in Robotic Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust numerical method for solving systems of trigonometric equations commonly encountered in robotic kinematics. Our approach employs polynomial substitution techniques combined with eigenvalue decomposition to handle singular matrices and edge cases effectively. The method demonstrates superior numerical stability compared to traditional approaches and has been implemented as an open-source Python package. For non-singular matrices, we employ Weierstrass substitution to transform the system into a quartic polynomial, ensuring all analytical solutions are found. For singular matrices, we develop specialized geometric constraint methods using SVD analysis. The solver demonstrates machine precision accuracy ($&lt; 10^{-15}$ error) with 100\% success rate on extensive test cases, making it particularly valuable for robotics applications such as inverse kinematics problems.</description>

Abstract: The high cost of robotic platforms limits students' ability to gain practical skills directly applicable in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper presents TARA, a low-cost, 3D-printed robotic arm designed for accessible robotics education. TARA includes an open-source repository with design files, assembly instructions, and baseline code, enabling users to build and customize the platform. The system balances affordability and functionality, offering a highly capable robotic arm for approximately 200 USD, significantly lower than industrial systems that often cost thousands of dollars. Experimental validation confirmed accurate performance in basic manipulation tasks. Rather than focusing on performance benchmarking, this work prioritizes educational reproducibility, providing a platform that students and educators can reliably replicate and extend.</description>

      <title>A Reactive Grasping Framework for Multi-DoF Grippers via Task Space Velocity Fields and Joint Space QP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP) in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions, and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to dynamic environments and external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for a Soft Robotic Finger with Stochastic Behavior based on Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>SR-SLAM: Scene-reliability Based RGB-D SLAM in Diverse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2) insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies. To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii) depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient. Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.</description>

      <title>A novel parameter estimation method for pneumatic soft hand control applying logarithmic decrement for pseudo rigid body modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70, brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators, enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.</description>

      <title>Novel bio-inspired soft actuators for upper-limb exoskeletons: design, fabrication and feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed implicit mapping framework. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Agent Instance Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene. Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition, OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is publicly available at https://openmulti666.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-Driven Metrics for Social Robot Navigation Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a joint effort towards the development of a data-driven Social Robot Navigation metric to facilitate benchmarking and policy optimization. We provide our motivations for our approach and describe our proposal for storing rated social navigation trajectory datasets. Following these guidelines, we compiled a dataset with 4427 trajectories -- 182 real and 4245 simulated -- and presented it to human raters, yielding a total of 4402 rated trajectories after data quality assurance. We also trained an RNN-based baseline metric on the dataset and present quantitative and qualitative results. All data, software, and model weights are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Toward a Holistic Multi-Criteria Trajectory Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Driving in Mixed Traffic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Multi-Context Meta-Learning: Unlocking robust and Generalized Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.</description>

      <title>TopoNav: Topological Graphs as a Key Enabler for Advanced Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language models (LLMs), but still faces challenges in memory management, especially in long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections, adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Reluctance to Ask for Help When Cooperating With Robots: Insights to Integrate Artificial Agents in HRC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for aid. This study identifies key aspects for the design of future user-assisting agents. We analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a user study examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans engaged in HRC tasks.</description>

      <title>FGO-SLAM: Enhancing Gaussian SLAM with Globally Consistent Opacity Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</description>

      <title>Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the object-relative state estimation task.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Input based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Change Decision-Making of Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow. Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of vehicle lane change decisions.</description>

      <title>Speculative Design of Equitable Robotics: Queer Fictions and Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+ populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group'' users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises. Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.</description>

      <title>Data Retrieval with Importance Weights for Few-Shot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications.</description>

      <title>MoTo: A Zero-shot Plug-in Interaction-aware Navigation for General Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments. Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training. However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68% and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods, respectively, without requiring additional training data.</description>

      <title>Articulated Object Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings, assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments. In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi- modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

      <title>Fail2Progress: Learning from Real-World Robot Failures with Stein Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures. After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization. Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.</description>

      <title>Non-conflicting Energy Minimization in Reinforcement Learning based Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.</description>

      <title>ManiFlow: A General Robot Manipulation Policy via Consistency Flow Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ManiFlow, a visuomotor imitation learning policy for general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action generation in just 1-2 inference steps. To handle diverse input modalities efficiently, we propose DiT-X, a diffusion transformer architecture with adaptive cross-attention and AdaLN-Zero conditioning that enables fine-grained feature interactions between action tokens and multi-modal observations. ManiFlow demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse simulation benchmarks and nearly doubles success rates on real-world tasks across single-arm, bimanual, and humanoid robot setups with increasing dexterity. The extensive evaluation further demonstrates the strong robustness and generalizability of ManiFlow to novel objects and background changes, and highlights its strong scaling capability with larger-scale datasets.

      <title>Multi-vessel Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Collision Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Marine Robotics: Emerging Trends in Underwater Perception and Ecosystem Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets, scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>AutoDrive-R$^2$: Incentivizing Reasoning and Self-Reflection Capacity for VLA Model in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Autonomy Framework for a Future Mars Science Helicopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems with Symmetries Based on Sliding Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels), which is also simulated for illustration.</description>

      <title>MIRAGE: Multimodal Intention Recognition and Admittance-Guided Enhancement in VR-based Multi-object Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality (VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition. This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across various applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Unsupervised Lidar Odometry Model from Normal to Snowy Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use. In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across a wider range of environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through Unified Latent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Method for Base Parameter Analysis in Robot Inertia Identification Based on Projective Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations. Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG), achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a 2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and efficient.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Heuristics for Human-Aware Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value (HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of generalizing to further human activities.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Trade-Offs in Motion Planning Algorithms for Optimal Industrial Robotic Work Cell Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions. However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible, introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two palletization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reliability in LLM-Integrated Robotic Systems: A Unified Approach to Security and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments, remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling, state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at https://llmeyesim.vercel.app/</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer-based navigation strategy for spacecraft in Circular Relative Orbit (CRO) scenarios, addressing challenges in proximity operations like formation flight and uncooperative target inspection. The proposed method adjusts observer gains based on the estimated state to achieve fast convergence and low noise sensitivity in state estimation. A Lyapunov-based analysis ensures stability and accuracy, while simulations using vision-based sensor data validate the approach under realistic conditions. Compared to classical observers with time-invariant gains, the proposed method enhances trajectory tracking precision and reduces control input switching, making it a promising solution for autonomous spacecraft localization and control.</description>

Abstract: The human somatosensory system integrates multimodal sensory feedback, including tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal signals, to enable comprehensive perception and effective interaction with the environment. Inspired by the biological mechanism, we present a sensorized soft anthropomorphic hand equipped with diverse sensors designed to emulate the sensory modalities of the human hand. This system incorporates biologically inspired encoding schemes that convert multimodal sensory data into spike trains, enabling highly-efficient processing through Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By utilizing these neuromorphic signals, the proposed framework achieves 97.14% accuracy in object recognition across varying poses, significantly outperforming previous studies on soft hands. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiator neuron model to enhance material classification by capturing dynamic thermal responses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of multimodal sensory fusion and highlight the potential of neuromorphic approaches for achieving efficient, robust, and human-like perception in robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Sem-RaDiff: Diffusion-Based 3D Radar Semantic Perception in Cluttered Agricultural Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02283v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Long Horizon Manipulation with LLM-based Planning and Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3 on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating strong generalization in practical scenarios.

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning with Adaptive Grids for Optical Microrobot Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly. These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination (R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset, highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions.

      <title>OpenGuide: Assistive Object Retrieval in Indoor Spaces for Individuals with Visual Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world, partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships, and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living environments.</description>

      <title>U-ARM : Ultra low-cost general teleoperation interface for robot manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose U-Arm, a low-cost and rapidly adaptable leader-follower teleoperation framework designed to interface with most of commercially available robotic arms. Our system supports teleoperation through three structurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control logic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot configurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces, we further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving a bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \$50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and \$56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common challenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods mechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Arm achieves 39\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task success rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon, another low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models of three configs and also provided simulation support for validating teleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data collected with U-Arm. The project website is https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/LeRobot-Anything-U-Arm.</description>

      <title>Coral: A Unifying Abstraction Layer for Composable Robotics Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software, Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system integration challenges, improving component reusability, system reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We release Coral open source.</description>

      <title>Classification of Vision-Based Tactile Sensors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution, low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle. Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values. Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by VBTS technology and directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: Given the cost and critical functions of satellite constellations, ensuring mission longevity and safe decommissioning is essential for space sustainability. This article presents a Model Predictive Control for spacecraft trajectory and setpoint stabilization under multiple actuation failures. The proposed solution allows us to efficiently control the faulty spacecraft enabling safe navigation towards servicing or collision-free trajectories. The proposed scheme ensures closed-loop asymptotic stability and is shown to be recursively feasible. We demonstrate its efficacy through open-source numerical results and realistic experiments using the ATMOS platform.</description>

      <title>Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.</description>

      <title>Curve-based slicer for multi-axis DLP 3D printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Harnessing ADAS for Pedestrian Safety: A Data-Driven Exploration of Fatality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian fatalities continue to rise in the United States, driven by factors such as human distraction, increased vehicle size, and complex traffic environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) offer a promising avenue for improving pedestrian safety by enhancing driver awareness and vehicle responsiveness. This study conducts a comprehensive data-driven analysis utilizing the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to quantify the effectiveness of specific ADAS features like Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking (PAEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW), in lowering pedestrian fatalities. By linking vehicle specifications with crash data, we assess how ADAS performance varies under different environmental and behavioral conditions, such as lighting, weather, and driver/pedestrian distraction. Results indicate that while ADAS can reduce crash severity and prevent some fatalities, its effectiveness is diminished in low-light and adverse weather. The findings highlight the need for enhanced sensor technologies and improved driver education. This research informs policymakers, transportation planners, and automotive manufacturers on optimizing ADAS deployment to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic-related deaths.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thrust vector control (TVC) is a key mechanism for stabilizing rockets during flight, yet conventional implementations remain costly and technically inaccessible to students and hobbyists. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a low-cost, 3D-printed, servo-driven two-dimensional gimbal developed for model rocket applications. The gimbal underwent more than 60 CAD iterations, with servo selection guided by torque, response time, and stability requirements. A high-speed camera and Fusion 360 parameter simulations were used to emulate dynamic instability, enabling evaluation of angular deflection, servo responsiveness, and structural durability. The results demonstrated stable actuation within plus or minus 5 degrees, with response times on the average order of 44.5 ms, while limitations included servo fatigue and pin-joint stress under extended loading. The project highlights the feasibility of student-accessible thrust vector control systems and their potential as a reproducible platform for STEM education and experimental aerospace research.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00117v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</description>

      <title>A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.</description>

      <title>AGS: Accelerating 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via CODEC-Assisted Frame Covisibility Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical task that enables autonomous vehicles to construct maps and localize themselves in unknown environments. Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple training iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.
  In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to boost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems process frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high similarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We propose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the robot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing their contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose a frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the video CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with workload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm. Our evaluation shows that AGS achieves up to $17.12\times$, $6.71\times$, and $5.41\times$ speedups against the mobile and high-end GPUs, and a state-of-the-art 3DGS accelerator, GSCore.</description>

      <title>MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

      <title>ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog, snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data. Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy, which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model</description>

      <title>AI-driven Dispensing of Coral Reseeding Devices for Broad-scale Restoration of the Great Barrier Reef</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%, sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5 frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this area.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability. Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number, our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.</description>

      <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shopping plays a significant role in shaping consumer identity and social integration. However, for individuals with visual impairments, navigating in supermarkets and identifying products can be an overwhelming and challenging experience. This paper presents an AI-based shopping assistant prototype designed to enhance the autonomy and inclusivity of visually impaired individuals in supermarket environments. The system integrates multiple technologies, including computer vision, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and indoor navigation, into a single, user-friendly platform. Using cameras for ArUco marker detection and real-time environmental scanning, the system helps users navigate the store, identify product locations, provide real-time auditory guidance, and gain context about their surroundings. The assistant interacts with the user through voice commands and multimodal feedback, promoting a more dynamic and engaging shopping experience. The system was evaluated through experiments, which demonstrated its ability to guide users effectively and improve their shopping experience. This paper contributes to the development of inclusive AI-driven assistive technologies aimed at enhancing accessibility and user independence for the shopping experience.</description>

      <title>Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Low-Level Neural Control of an Industrial-Grade 6D Magnetic Levitation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However, controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex, unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/neural-maglev.</description>

      <title>Quantum game models for interaction-aware decision-making in automated driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game - Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.</description>

      <title>TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked robust and practical methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Reverse Path-Planning and Path-Tracking Control of a Vehicle with Trailer System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Online Identification using Adaptive Laws and Neural Networks for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness Enhancement for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System via Online Tuning and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Event Camera Place Recognition Under Varying Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and benchmarking framework.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Task Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the automatic task planning problem for multi-agent systems. A formal framework is developed based on the Nondeterministic Finite Automata with $\epsilon$-transitions, where given the capabilities, constraints and failure modes of the agents involved, an initial state of the system and a task specification, an optimal solution is generated that satisfies the system constraints and the task specification. The resulting solution is guaranteed to be complete and optimal; moreover a heuristic solution that offers significant reduction of the computational requirements while relaxing the completeness and optimality requirements is proposed. The constructed system model is independent from the initial condition and the task specification, alleviating the need to repeat the costly pre-processing cycle for solving other scenarios, while allowing the incorporation of failure modes on-the-fly. Two case studies are provided: a simple one to showcase the concepts of the proposed methodology and a more elaborate one to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Multi Object Tracking for Predictive Collision Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in complex environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, necessitates accurate multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance. This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors. This thesis contributes to the ongoing development of safe and efficient autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security in Multi-Robot Systems through Co-Observation Planning, Reachability Analysis, and Network Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses security challenges in multi-robot systems (MRS) where adversaries may compromise robot control, risking unauthorized access to forbidden areas. We propose a novel multi-robot optimal planning algorithm that integrates mutual observations and introduces reachability constraints for enhanced security. This ensures that, even with adversarial movements, compromised robots cannot breach forbidden regions without missing scheduled co-observations. The reachability constraint uses ellipsoidal over-approximation for efficient intersection checking and gradient computation. To enhance system resilience and tackle feasibility challenges, we also introduce sub-teams. These cohesive units replace individual robot assignments along each route, enabling redundant robots to deviate for co-observations across different trajectories, securing multiple sub-teams without requiring modifications. We formulate the cross-trajectory co-observation plan by solving a network flow coverage problem on the checkpoint graph generated from the original unsecured MRS trajectories, providing the same security guarantees against plan-deviation attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm, which significantly strengthens the security of multi-robot systems in the face of adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>Dyna-LfLH: Learning Agile Navigation in Dynamic Environments from Learned Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Dynamic Learning from Learned Hallucination (Dyna-LfLH), a self-supervised method for training motion planners to navigate environments with dense and dynamic obstacles. Classical planners struggle with dense, unpredictable obstacles due to limited computation, while learning-based planners face challenges in acquiring high- quality demonstrations for imitation learning or dealing with exploration inefficiencies in reinforcement learning. Building on Learning from Hallucination (LfH), which synthesizes training data from past successful navigation experiences in simpler environments, Dyna-LfLH incorporates dynamic obstacles by generating them through a learned latent distribution. This enables efficient and safe motion planner training. We evaluate Dyna-LfLH on a ground robot in both simulated and real environments, achieving up to a 25% improvement in success rate compared to baselines.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Yummy Operations Robot Initiative (YORI), a proprioceptive dual-arm robotic system that demonstrates autonomous multi-dish cooking for scalable food service applications. YORI integrates a dual-arm manipulator equipped with proprioceptive actuators, custom-designed tools, appliances, and a structured kitchen environment to address the complexities of cooking tasks. The proprioceptive actuators enable fast, precise, force-controlled movements while mitigating the risks associated with cooking-related impacts. The system's modular kitchen design and flexible tool-changing mechanism support simultaneous multi-dish preparation through torque control and optimization-based motion planning and scheduling. A comprehensive scheduling framework with dynamic rescheduling ensures reliable adaptation to new orders and delays. The system was publicly validated through live demonstrations, reliably preparing steak-frites across multiple convention sessions. This paper details YORI's design and explores future directions in kitchen optimization, task planning, and food quality control, demonstrating its potential as a scalable robotic cooking solution.

      <title>A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</description>

      <title>Tactile SoftHand-A: 3D-Printed, Tactile, Highly-underactuated, Anthropomorphic Robot Hand with an Antagonistic Tendon Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A challenging and important problem for tendon-driven multi-fingered robotic hands is to ensure grasping adaptivity while minimizing the number of actuators needed to provide human-like functionality. Inspired by the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, this paper introduces a 3D-printed, highly-underactuated, tactile-sensorized, five-finger robotic hand named the Tactile SoftHand-A, which features an antagonistic mechanism to actively open and close the hand. Our proposed dual-tendon design gives options that allow active control of specific (distal or proximal interphalangeal) joints; for example, to adjust from an enclosing to fingertip grasp or to manipulate an object with a fingertip. We also develop and integrate a new design of fully 3D-printed vision-based tactile sensor within the fingers that requires minimal hand assembly. A control scheme based on analytically extracting contact location and slip from the tactile images is used to coordinate the antagonistic tendon mechanism (using a marker displacement density map, suitable for TacTip-based sensors). We perform extensive testing of a single finger, the entire hand, and the tactile capabilities to show the improvements in reactivity, load-bearing, and manipulability in comparison to a SoftHand that lacks the antagonistic mechanism. We also demonstrate the hand's reactivity to contact disturbances including slip, and how this enables teleoperated control from human hand gestures. Overall, this study points the way towards a class of low-cost, accessible, 3D-printable, tactile, underactuated human-like robotic hands, and we openly release the designs to facilitate others to build upon this work. The designs are open-sourced at https://github.com/HaoranLi-Data/Tactile_SoftHand_A</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a lightweight systematic solution for multi-robot coordinated navigation with decentralized cooperative perception. An information flow is first created to facilitate real-time observation sharing over unreliable ad-hoc networks. Then, the environmental uncertainties of each robot are reduced by interaction fields that deliver complementary information. Finally, path optimization is achieved, enabling self-organized coordination with effective convergence, divergence, and collision avoidance. Our method is fully interpretable and ready for deployment without gaps. Comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate reduced path redundancy, robust performance across various tasks, and minimal demands on computation and communication.</description>

      <title>Frontier Shepherding: A Bio-inspired Multi-robot Framework for Large-Scale Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of large-scale environments remains a critical challenge in robotics, with applications ranging from environmental monitoring to search and rescue operations. This article proposes Frontier Shepherding (FroShe), a bio-inspired multi-robot framework for large-scale exploration. The framework heuristically models frontier exploration based on the shepherding behavior of herding dogs, where frontiers are treated as a swarm of sheep reacting to robots modeled as shepherding dogs. FroShe is robust across varying environment sizes and obstacle densities, requiring minimal parameter tuning for deployment across multiple agents. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method performs consistently, regardless of environment complexity, and outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies by an average of 20% with three UAVs. The approach was further validated in real-world experiments using single- and dual-drone deployments in a forest-like environment.</description>

      <title>Stretchable Electrohydraulic Artificial Muscle for Full Motion Ranges in Musculoskeletal Antagonistic Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial muscles play a crucial role in musculoskeletal robotics and prosthetics to approximate the force-generating functionality of biological muscle. However, current artificial muscle systems are typically limited to either contraction or extension, not both. This limitation hinders the development of fully functional artificial musculoskeletal systems. We address this challenge by introducing an artificial antagonistic muscle system capable of both contraction and extension. Our design integrates non-stretchable electrohydraulic soft actuators (HASELs) with electrostatic clutches within an antagonistic musculoskeletal framework. This configuration enables an antagonistic joint to achieve a full range of motion without displacement loss due to tendon slack. We implement a synchronization method to coordinate muscle and clutch units, ensuring smooth motion profiles and speeds. This approach facilitates seamless transitions between antagonistic muscles at operational frequencies of up to 3.2 Hz. While our prototype utilizes electrohydraulic actuators, this muscle-clutch concept is adaptable to other non-stretchable artificial muscles, such as McKibben actuators, expanding their capability for extension and full range of motion in antagonistic setups. Our design represents a significant advancement in the development of fundamental components for more functional and efficient artificial musculoskeletal systems, bringing their capabilities closer to those of their biological counterparts.</description>

      <title>Force Myography based Torque Estimation in Human Knee and Ankle Joints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The online adaptation of exoskeleton control based on muscle activity sensing offers a promising approach to personalizing exoskeleton behavior based on the user's biosignals. While electromyography (EMG)-based methods have demonstrated improvements in joint torque estimation, EMG sensors require direct skin contact and extensive post-processing. In contrast, force myography (FMG) measures normal forces resulting from changes in muscle volume due to muscle activity. We propose an FMG-based method to estimate knee and ankle joint torques by integrating joint angles and velocities with muscle activity data. We learn a model for joint torque estimation using Gaussian process regression (GPR). The effectiveness of the proposed FMG-based method is validated on isokinetic motions performed by ten participants. The model is compared to a baseline model that uses only joint angle and velocity, as well as a model augmented by EMG data. The results indicate that incorporating FMG into exoskeleton control can improve the estimation of joint torque for the ankle and knee joints in novel task characteristics within a single participant. Although the findings suggest that this approach may not improve the generalizability of estimates between multiple participants, they highlight the need for further research into its potential applications in exoskeleton control.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning-Based Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Using PPO and B-Splines in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SmartBSP, an advanced self-supervised learning framework for real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in autonomous robotics navigating through complex environments. The proposed system integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Actor-Critic architecture to process limited LIDAR inputs and compute spatial decision-making probabilities. The robot's perceptual field is discretized into a grid format, which the CNN analyzes to produce a spatial probability distribution. During the training process a nuanced cost function is minimized that accounts for path curvature, endpoint proximity, and obstacle avoidance. Simulations results in different scenarios validate the algorithm's resilience and adaptability across diverse operational scenarios. Subsequently, Real-time experiments, employing the Robot Operating System (ROS), were carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Wheeled Lab: Modern Sim2Real for Low-cost, Open-source Wheeled Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been pivotal in recent robotics milestones and is poised to play a prominent role in the future. However, these advances can rely on proprietary simulators, expensive hardware, and a daunting range of tools and skills. As a result, broader communities are disconnecting from the state-of-the-art; education curricula are poorly equipped to teach indispensable modern robotics skills involving hardware, deployment, and iterative development. To address this gap between the broader and scientific communities, we contribute Wheeled Lab, an ecosystem which integrates accessible, open-source wheeled robots with Isaac Lab, an open-source robot learning and simulation framework, that is widely adopted in the state-of-the-art. To kickstart research and education, this work demonstrates three state-of-the-art zero-shot policies for small-scale RC cars developed through Wheeled Lab: controlled drifting, elevation traversal, and visual navigation. The full stack, from hardware to software, is low-cost and open-source. Videos and additional materials can be found at: https://uwrobotlearning.github.io/WheeledLab/</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient for Disturbance Attenuation and Its Application to Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Touch and Bending Perception Using Electrical Impedance Tomography for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) offers a promising solution for distributed tactile sensing with minimal wiring and full-surface coverage in robotic applications. However, EIT-based tactile sensors face significant challenges during surface bending. Deformation alters the baseline impedance distribution and couples with touch-induced conductivity variations, complicating signal interpretation. To address this challenge, we present a novel sensing framework that integrates a deep neural network for interaction state classification with a dynamic adaptive reference strategy to decouple touch and deformation signals, while a data-driven regression model translates EIT voltage changes into continuous bending angles. The framework is validated using a magnetic hydrogel composite sensor that conforms to bendable surfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise and robust bending angle estimation, high accuracy in distinguishing touch, bending, and idle states, and significantly improves touch localization quality under bending deformation compared to conventional fixed-reference methods. Real-time experiments confirm the system's capability to reliably detect multi-touch interactions and track bending angles across varying deformation conditions. This work paves the way for flexible EIT-based robotic skins capable of rich multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Furthermore, an incremental update theorem is established, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving an update speed significantly faster than comparison methods, while safely reaching the target position.

Abstract: This research addresses the question, which characteristics a cognitive architecture must have to leverage the benefits of natural language in Co-Constructive Task Learning (CCTL). To provide context, we first discuss Interactive Task Learning (ITL), the mechanisms of the human memory system, and the significance of natural language and multi-modality. Next, we examine the current state of cognitive architectures, analyzing their capabilities to inform a concept of CCTL grounded in multiple sources. We then integrate insights from various research domains to develop a unified framework. Finally, we conclude by identifying the remaining challenges and requirements necessary to achieve CCTL in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).</description>

      <title>Wavelet Policy: Imitation Policy Learning in the Scale Domain with Wavelet Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction tasks, directly map robotic observations into the action space, such as high-dimensional visual data and proprioception. When deploying at the edge, we found the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction leads to neglecting the inherent rhythm information embedded within action sequences, resulting in errors at critical moments. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of time-scale domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) and new Features Extractor (FE) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features using the Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder (SE2MD) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the scale domain and appropriately increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Scale Domain Filter (LSDF) after each decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy maintaining a comparable parameter count outperforms SOTA end-to-end methods on four challenging simulation robotic arm tasks and real tasks, especially at critical moments and remote settings simultaneously. We release the source code and model checkpoint of simulation task at https://github.com/lurenjia384/Wavelet_Policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role for humans and robots to interact effectively with their environment, particularly for tasks requiring the understanding of contact properties. Solving such dexterous manipulation tasks often relies on imitation learning from demonstration datasets, which are typically collected via teleoperation systems and often demand substantial time and effort. To address these challenges, we present ViTaMIn, an embodiment-free manipulation interface that seamlessly integrates visual and tactile sensing into a hand-held gripper, enabling data collection without the need for teleoperation. Our design employs a compliant Fin Ray gripper with tactile sensing, allowing operators to perceive force feedback during manipulation for more intuitive operation. Additionally, we propose a multimodal representation learning strategy to obtain pre-trained tactile representations, improving data efficiency and policy robustness. Experiments on seven contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate that ViTaMIn significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Domain-Conditioned Scene Graphs for State-Grounded Task Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent robotic task planning frameworks have integrated large multimodal models (LMMs) such as GPT-4o. To address grounding issues of such models, it has been suggested to split the pipeline into perceptional state grounding and subsequent state-based planning. As we show in this work, the state grounding ability of LMM-based approaches is still limited by weaknesses in granular, structured, domain-specific scene understanding. To address this shortcoming, we develop a more structured state grounding framework that features a domain-conditioned scene graph as its scene representation. We show that such representation is actionable in nature as it is directly mappable to a symbolic state in planning languages such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We provide an instantiation of our state grounding framework where the domain-conditioned scene graph generation is implemented with a lightweight vision-language approach that classifies domain-specific predicates on top of domain-relevant object detections. Evaluated across three domains, our approach achieves significantly higher state rounding accuracy and task planning success rates compared to LMM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Making Physical Objects with Generative AI and Robotic Assembly: Considering Fabrication Constraints, Sustainability, Time, Functionality, and Accessibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D generative AI enables rapid and accessible creation of 3D models from text or image inputs. However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</description>

Abstract: In multi-obstacle environments, real-time performance and safety in robot motion control have long been challenging issues, as conventional methods often struggle to balance the two. In this paper, we propose a novel motion control framework composed of a Neural network-based path planner and a Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller based on control Barrier function (NMPCB) . The planner predicts the next target point through a lightweight neural network and generates a reference trajectory for the controller. In the design of the controller, we introduce the dual problem of control barrier function (CBF) as the obstacle avoidance constraint, enabling it to ensure robot motion safety while significantly reducing computation time. The controller directly outputs control commands to the robot by tracking the reference trajectory. This framework achieves a balance between real-time performance and safety. We validate the feasibility of the framework through numerical simulations and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</description>

      <title>Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands. Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>ManipBench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Low-Level Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: https://manipbench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Toward Real-World Cooperative and Competitive Soccer with Quadrupedal Robot Teams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.</description>

      <title>Co-Design of Soft Gripper with Neural Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For robot manipulation, both the controller and end-effector design are crucial. Soft grippers are generalizable by deforming to different geometries, but designing such a gripper and finding its grasp pose remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a co-design framework that generates an optimized soft gripper's block-wise stiffness distribution and its grasping pose, using a neural physics model trained in simulation. We derived a uniform-pressure tendon model for a flexure-based soft finger, then generated a diverse dataset by randomizing both gripper pose and design parameters. A neural network is trained to approximate this forward simulation, yielding a fast, differentiable surrogate. We embed that surrogate in an end-to-end optimization loop to optimize the ideal stiffness configuration and best grasp pose. Finally, we 3D-print the optimized grippers of various stiffness by changing the structural parameters. We demonstrate that our co-designed grippers significantly outperform baseline designs in both simulation and hardware experiments. More info: http://yswhynot.github.io/codesign-soft/</description>

      <title>LocoTouch: Learning Dynamic Quadrupedal Transport with Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated remarkable agility and robustness in traversing complex terrains. However, they struggle with dynamic object interactions, where contact must be precisely sensed and controlled. To bridge this gap, we present LocoTouch, a system that equips quadrupedal robots with tactile sensing to address a particularly challenging task in this category: long-distance transport of unsecured cylindrical objects, which typically requires custom mounting or fastening mechanisms to maintain stability. For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density distributed tactile sensor that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively leverage tactile feedback for robot control, we develop a simulation environment with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to promote robust, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably transporting a wide range of unsecured cylindrical objects with diverse sizes, weights, and surface properties. Moreover, it remains robust over long distances, on uneven terrain, and under severe perturbations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Manipulation-Enhanced Semantic Mapping With Uncertainty-Informed Action Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service robots operating in cluttered human environments such as homes, offices, and schools cannot rely on predefined object arrangements and must continuously update their semantic and spatial estimates while dealing with possible frequent rearrangements. Efficient and accurate mapping under such conditions demands selecting informative viewpoints and targeted manipulations to reduce occlusions and uncertainty. In this work, we present a manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping framework for occlusion-heavy shelf scenes that integrates evidential metric-semantic mapping with reinforcement-learning-based next-best view planning and targeted action selection. Our method thereby exploits uncertainty estimates from Dirichlet and Beta distributions in the map prediction networks to guide both active sensor placement and object manipulation, focusing on areas with high uncertainty and selecting actions with high expected information gain. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-informed push strategy that targets occlusion-critical objects and generates minimally invasive actions to reveal hidden regions by reducing overall uncertainty in the scene. The experimental evaluation shows that our framework enables to accurately map cluttered scenes, while substantially reducing object displacement and achieving a 95% reduction in planning time compared to the state-of-the-art, thereby realizing real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>SAVOR: Skill Affordance Learning from Visuo-Haptic Perception for Robot-Assisted Bite Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot-assisted feeding requires reliable bite acquisition, a challenging task due to the complex interactions between utensils and food with diverse physical properties. These interactions are further complicated by the temporal variability of food properties-for example, steak becomes firm as it cools even during a meal. To address this, we propose SAVOR, a novel approach for learning skill affordances for bite acquisition-how suitable a manipulation skill (e.g., skewering, scooping) is for a given utensil-food interaction. In our formulation, skill affordances arise from the combination of tool affordances (what a utensil can do) and food affordances (what the food allows). Tool affordances are learned offline through calibration, where different utensils interact with a variety of foods to model their functional capabilities. Food affordances are characterized by physical properties such as softness, moisture, and viscosity, initially inferred through commonsense reasoning using a visually-conditioned language model and then dynamically refined through online multi-modal visuo-haptic perception using SAVOR-Net during interaction. Our method integrates these offline and online estimates to predict skill affordances in real time, enabling the robot to select the most appropriate skill for each food item. Evaluated on 20 single-item foods and 10 in-the-wild meals, our approach improves bite acquisition success rate by 13% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) category-based methods (e.g. use skewer for fruits). These results highlight the importance of modeling interaction-driven skill affordances for generalizable and effective robot-assisted bite acquisition.

      <title>CLONE: Closed-Loop Whole-Body Humanoid Teleoperation for Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid teleoperation plays a vital role in demonstrating and collecting data for complex humanoid-scene interactions. However, current teleoperation systems face critical limitations: they decouple upper- and lower-body control to maintain stability, restricting natural coordination, and operate open-loop without real-time position feedback, leading to accumulated drift. The fundamental challenge is achieving precise, coordinated whole-body teleoperation over extended durations while maintaining accurate global positioning. Here we show that an MoE-based teleoperation system, CLONE, with closed-loop error correction enables unprecedented whole-body teleoperation fidelity, maintaining minimal positional drift over long-range trajectories using only head and hand tracking from an MR headset. Unlike previous methods that either sacrifice coordination for stability or suffer from unbounded drift, CLONE learns diverse motion skills while preventing tracking error accumulation through real-time feedback, enabling complex coordinated movements such as ``picking up objects from the ground.'' These results establish a new milestone for whole-body humanoid teleoperation for long-horizon humanoid-scene interaction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in teleoperation systems have enabled high-quality data collection for robotic manipulators, showing impressive results in learning manipulation at scale. This progress suggests that extending these capabilities to robotic hands could unlock an even broader range of manipulation skills, especially if we could achieve the same level of dexterity that human hands exhibit. However, teleoperating robotic hands is far from a solved problem, as it presents a significant challenge due to the high degrees of freedom of robotic hands and the complex dynamics occurring during contact-rich settings. In this work, we present ExoStart, a general and scalable learning framework that leverages human dexterity to improve robotic hand control. In particular, we obtain high-quality data by collecting direct demonstrations without a robot in the loop using a sensorized low-cost wearable exoskeleton, capturing the rich behaviors that humans can demonstrate with their own hands. We also propose a simulation-based dynamics filter that generates dynamically feasible trajectories from the collected demonstrations and use the generated trajectories to bootstrap an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method that relies only on simple sparse rewards. The ExoStart pipeline is generalizable and yields robust policies that transfer zero-shot to the real robot. Our results demonstrate that ExoStart can generate dexterous real-world hand skills, achieving a success rate above 50% on a wide range of complex tasks such as opening an AirPods case or inserting and turning a key in a lock.

      <title>From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

      <title>NetRoller: Interfacing General and Specialized Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating General Models (GMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with Specialized Models (SMs) in autonomous driving tasks presents a promising approach to mitigating challenges in data diversity and model capacity of existing specialized driving models. However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Rex-sys-hk/NetRoller .</description>

      <title>A Physics-Based Continuum Model for Versatile, Scalable, and Fast Terramechanics Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR). Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems. Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Learning and Adaptive Planning for Robotic Information Gathering Based on Streaming Data</title>

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing computational complexity for longer missions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Study on Human-Robot Interaction using Semantics-based Situational Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-level semantics (evaluation of the environment) on Human-Robot Teams (HRT) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the context of mobile robot deployments. Although semantics has been widely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm is underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based framework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how much semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In such missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex situations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have a high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their attention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build Situational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented semantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase the operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in switching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that participants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level semantics to use teleoperation mode more.</description>

      <title>Computational Design and Fabrication of Modular Robots with Untethered Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural organisms utilize distributed actuation through their musculoskeletal systems to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies for varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in robotics is to emulate this capability of natural organisms, which has motivated the development of numerous soft robotic systems. However, such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the ability to change form or function on demand, or remain tethered to bulky control systems. To address these limitations, we present a framework for designing and controlling robots that utilize distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that integrates 3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight actuators, enabling the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby providing localized, untethered control over the distributed skeletal network and producing global deformations of the robot. To fully capitalize on the extensive design space, we introduce two computational tools: one for optimizing the robot's skeletal graph to achieve multiple target deformations, and another for co-optimizing skeletal designs and control gaits to realize desired locomotion. We validate our framework by constructing several robots that demonstrate complex shape morphing, diverse control schemes, and environmental adaptability. Our system integrates advances in modular material building, untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living organisms.</description>

      <title>DexFruit: Dexterous Manipulation and Gaussian Splatting Inspection of Fruit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DexFruit is a robotic manipulation framework that enables gentle, autonomous handling of fragile fruit and precise evaluation of damage. Many fruits are fragile and prone to bruising, thus requiring humans to manually harvest them with care. In this work, we demonstrate by using optical tactile sensing, autonomous manipulation of fruit with minimal damage can be achieved. We show that our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both reduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits: strawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat, a novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring damage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat, we distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into the 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and general, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92% grasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up to an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to our baselines across our three tested fruits. We rigorously evaluate this result with over 630 trials. Please checkout our website at https://dex-fruit.github.io .</description>

      <title>Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

      <title>HERMES: Human-to-Robot Embodied Learning from Multi-Source Motion Data for Mobile Dexterous Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation. Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors. Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2508.20547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis.</description>

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in tasks like visual question answering and document understanding. However, their potential to comprehend embodied environments and navigate within them remains underexplored. In this work, we first study the challenge of open-vocabulary object navigation by introducing DivScene, a large-scale dataset with 4,614 houses across 81 scene types and 5,707 kinds of target objects. Our dataset provides a much greater diversity of target objects and scene types than existing datasets, enabling a comprehensive task evaluation. We evaluated various methods with LVLMs and LLMs on our dataset and found that current models still fall short of open-vocab object navigation ability. Then, we fine-tuned LVLMs to predict the next action with CoT explanations. We observe that LVLM's navigation ability can be improved substantially with only BFS-generated shortest paths without any human supervision, surpassing GPT-4o by over 20% in success rates.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

      <title>Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</description>

      <title>General agents contain world models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <title>RALLY: Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked Navigation for Agentic UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.</description>

      <title>NarraGuide: an LLM-based Narrative Mobile Robot for Remote Place Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic telepresence enables users to navigate and experience remote environments. However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</description>

      <title>SoK: Cybersecurity Assessment of Humanoid Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoids are progressing toward practical deployment across healthcare, industrial, defense, and service sectors. While typically considered cyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked software stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS) middleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security profile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not fully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as LiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus overlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the robot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization of knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating fragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We introduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known attacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to human-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a quantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated through Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three real-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed varying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5% across the platforms. This work introduces a structured, evidence-based assessment method that enables systematic security evaluation, supports cross-platform benchmarking, and guides prioritization of security investments in humanoid robotics.</description>
