      <title>Freeze-Tag is NP-hard in 2D with $L_1$ distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) is a scheduling problem with application in robot swarm activation and was introduced by Arkin et al. in 2002. This problem seeks an efficient way of activating a robot swarm starting with a single active robot. Activations occur through direct contact, and once a robot becomes active, it can move and help activate other robots.
  Although the problem has been shown to be NP-hard in the Euclidean plane $R^2$ under the $L_2$ distance, and in three-dimensional Euclidean space $R^3$ under any $L_p$ distance with $p \ge 1$, its complexity under the $L_1$ (Manhattan) distance in $R^2$ has remained an open question. In this paper, we settle this question by proving that FTP is strongly NP-hard in the Euclidean plane with $L_1$ distance.</description>

      <title>Realizing Metric Spaces with Convex Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of obstacles has a major impact on distance computation, motion planning, and visibility. While these problems are well studied in the plane, our understanding in three and higher dimensions is still limited. We investigate how different obstacle properties affect the induced geodesic metric in three-dimensional space. A finite metric space is said to be approximately realizable by a collection of obstacles if, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it can be embedded into the free space around the obstacles with geodesic distance and worst-case distortion $1+\varepsilon$. We focus on three key properties-convexity, disjointness, and fatness-and analyze how omitting each of them influences realizability.
  Our main result shows that if fatness is dropped, then every finite metric space can be realized with distortion $1+\varepsilon$ using convex, pairwise disjoint obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^3$, even if all obstacles are congruent equilateral triangles. Moreover, if we enforce fatness but drop convexity or disjointness, the same realizability still holds.
  Our results have important implications on the approximability of TSP with Obstacles, a natural variant of TSP introduced recently by Alkema et al. (ESA 2022). Specifically, we use the recent results of Banerjee et al. on TSP in doubling spaces (FOCS 2024) and of Chew et al. on distances among obstacles (Information Processing Letters 2002) to show that TSP with Obstacles admits a PTAS if the obstacles are convex, fat, and pairwise disjoint. If any of these three properties is dropped, then our results, combined with the APX-hardness of Metric TSP, demonstrate that TSP with Obstacles is APX-hard.</description>

      <title>Higher-order, generically complete, continuous, and polynomial-time isometry invariants of periodic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic crystals within hours on a desktop computer.</description>

      <title>Robust Barycenters of Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when $q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter diagram for generic transportation costs ($q &gt; 1$), in particular those robust to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address: https://github.com/Keanu-Sisouk/RobustBarycenter .</description>

      <title>New Complexity and Algorithmic Bounds for Minimum Consistent Subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Minimum Consistent Subset (MCS) problem, we are presented with a connected simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, consisting of a vertex set $V$ of size $n$ and an edge set $E$. Each vertex in $V$ is assigned a color from the set $\{1,2,\ldots, c\}$. The objective is to determine a subset $V' \subseteq V$ with minimum possible cardinality, such that for every vertex $v \in V$, at least one of its nearest neighbors in $V'$ (measured in terms of the hop distance) shares the same color as $v$. A variant of MCS is the minimum strict consistent subset (MSCS) in which instead of requiring at least one nearest neighbor of $v$, all the nearest neighbors of $v$ in $V'$ must have the same color as $v$. The decision version for MCS problem as well as for MSCS problem asks whether there exists a subset $V'$ of cardinality at most $l$ for some positive integer $l$. The MCS problem is known to be NP-complete for planar graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that the MCS problem for trees, when the number of colors $c$ is considered an input parameter, is NP-complete. We propose a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for MCS on trees running in $O(2^{6c}n^6)$ time, significantly improving the currently best-known algorithm whose running time is $O(2^{4c}n^{2c+3})$. In an effort to comprehensively understand the computational complexity of the MCS problem across different graph classes, we extend our investigation to interval graphs. We show that it remains NP-complete for interval graphs, thus enriching graph classes where MCS remains intractable.
  We also show that the MSCS problem is log-APX-hard on general graphs and NP-complete on planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Provable Non-Convex Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion: Geometry, Reconstruction, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering the configuration of points from their partial pairwise distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem, arises in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDMC problem by formulating it as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix implicitly enforces geometric consistency through nonnegativity and the triangle inequality, a structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p\geq O(\nu^2 r^2\log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDMC-specific incoherence parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq O(\nu r^{3/2}\log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$. A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which requires a novel application of the Hanson-Wright inequality to establish an optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we provide a geometric interpretation of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDMC setting and provide robustness guarantees for our method.</description>
