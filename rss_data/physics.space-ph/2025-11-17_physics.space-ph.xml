      <title>In situ Evidence of 5-minute Oscillations from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's surface vibrates in characteristic 5-minute oscillations, known as p-modes, generated by sound waves trapped within the convection zone. Although these oscillations have long been hypothesized to reach into the solar wind, direct in situ evidence has remained elusive, even during previous close encounters by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Here, we present the first promising in situ detection of 5-minute oscillations in the upper solar corona, based on observations from PSP's three closest perihelia. In two events at 9.9 solar radii, we identify statistically significant ($\sim$ 6 $\sigma$) 3.1-3.2 mHz peaks in the magnetic field power spectrum, each appearing as a large-amplitude, spherically polarized Alfv\'enic wave train lasting approximately 35 minutes. These results demonstrate that global solar oscillations can reach and potentially influence the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Solar Sail Momentum Management With Mass Translation and Reflectivity Devices Using Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar sails enable propellant-free space missions by utilizing solar radiation pressure as thrust. However, disturbance torques act on the solar sail and effective attitude control leads to the continuous accumulation of reaction wheel angular momentum, necessitating an efficient momentum management strategy to prevent saturation. This paper presents a novel momentum management controller using model predictive control (MPC) that is tailored for solar sails, accommodating the unique actuation mechanisms of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs). A first-order hold discretization and tailored motion costs are applied to the AMT translation, while the RCD actuation is handled using pulse-width modulation (PWM)-inspired quantization to address their on-off inputs. To enhance prediction accuracy, an iterative backwards-in-time MPC approach is introduced, incorporating the effects of PWM-quantized inputs into the optimization process. The dynamic model accounts for the time-dependent center of mass and moment of inertia changes caused by AMT translation, extending its applicability to other spacecraft with mass-shifting actuators. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reaction wheel desaturation, attitude control, and momentum management actuation efficiency, highlighting the potential of integrating MPC to manage coupled nonlinear dynamics and discrete actuator constraints for solar sails.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>
