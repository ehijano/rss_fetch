      <title>Unusual Properties of Adiabatic Invariance in a Billiard Model Related to the Adiabatic Piston Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of two massive particles along a straight line. A lighter particle bounces back and forth between a heavier particle and a stationary wall, with all collisions being ideally elastic. It is known that if the lighter particle moves much faster than the heavier one, and the kinetic energies of the particles are of the same order, then the product of the speed of the lighter particle and the distance between the heavier particle and the wall is an adiabatic invariant: its value remains approximately constant over a long period. We show that the value of this adiabatic invariant, calculated at the collisions of the lighter particle with the wall, is a constant of motion (i.e., {an exact adiabatic invariant}). On the other hand, the value of this adiabatic invariant at the collisions between the particles slowly and monotonically decays with each collision.
  The model we consider is a highly simplified version of the classical adiabatic piston problem, where the lighter particle represents a gas particle, and the heavier particle represents the piston.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Objectivity (Rotational Invariance) of the Stored Energy Density in Continuum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note is concerned with the rotational invariance of the stored energy density in continuum physics as a scalar function of a few vectors. A simple derivation is presented for the determination of the general form of the energy density in the case of a two-dimensional space. It is also shown that the general form of the energy density so determined may be further reduced. The three-dimensional case is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Edge States with Hidden Topology in Spinner Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries -- whether explicit, latent, or hidden -- are fundamental to understanding topological materials. This work introduces a prototypical spring-mass model that extends beyond established canonical models, revealing topological edge states with distinct profiles at opposite edges. These edge states originate from hidden symmetries that become apparent only in deformation coordinates, as opposed to the conventional displacement coordinates used for bulk-boundary correspondence. Our model realized through the intricate connectivity of a spinner chain, demonstrates experimentally distinct edge states at opposite ends. By extending this framework to two dimensions, we explore the conditions required for such edge waves and their hidden symmetry in deformation coordinates. We also show that these edge states are robust against disorders that respect the hidden symmetry. This research paves the way for advanced material designs with tailored boundary conditions and edge state profiles, offering potential applications in fields such as photonics, acoustics, and mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Notes on rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.10048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed on the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the different concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of constitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper implementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic simple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Characteristic Mode Theory for Structures in Arbitrary Background: Computation, Benchmarks, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency-domain technique.</description>
