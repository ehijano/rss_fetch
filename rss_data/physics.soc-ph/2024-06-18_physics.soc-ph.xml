      <title>Indicators of the human origin of numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have demonstrated that humans are unable to generate a sequence of random numbers that corresponds in a statistical sense to a simple distribution such as the uniform distribution. The purpose of this article is to present the results of research on the generation of random number sequences by humans. The article describes 10 effects found in such studies, mechanisms explaining these effects, and 14 measures (not including modifications) used to detect deviations from randomness in the sequences. The analysis of numerical sequences is not only of academic interest; it can also be used for the purpose of data validation (auditing).</description>

      <title>Shape patterns in popularity series of video games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, digital games have become increasingly present in people's lives both as a leisure activity or in gamified activities of everyday life. Despite this growing presence, large-scale, data-driven analyses of video games remain a small fraction of the related literature. In this sense, the present work constitutes an investigation of patterns in popularity series of video games based on monthly popularity series, spanning eleven years, for close to six thousand games listed on the online platform Steam. Utilizing these series, after a preprocessing stage, we perform a clustering task in order to group the series solely based on their shape. Our results indicate the existence of five clusters of shape patterns named decreasing, hilly, increasing, valley, and bursty, with approximately half of the games showing a decreasing popularity pattern, 20.7% being hilly, 11.8% increasing, 11.0% bursty, and 9.1% valley. Finally, we have probed the prevalence and persistence of shape patterns by comparing the shapes of longer popularity series during their early stages and after completion. We have found the majority of games tend to maintain their pattern over time, except for a constant pattern that appears early in popularity series only to later originate hilly and bursty popularity series.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Task Force Report for the American Astronomical Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS, finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences. We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits -- particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint. They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more inclusive, and more productive.</description>

      <title>Resilience patterns in higher-order meta-population networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-population networks are effective tools for capturing population movement across distinct regions, but the assumption of well-mixed regions fails to capture the reality of population higher-order interactions. As a multidimensional system capturing mobility characteristics, meta-population networks are inherently complex and difficult to interpret when subjected to resilience analysis based on N-dimensional equations. We propose a higher-order meta-population model that captures large-scale global cross-regional mobility and small-scale higher-order interactions within regions. Remarkably, we extend the dimension-reduction approach, simplifying the N-dimensional higher-order meta-population system into a one-dimensional equation by decomposing different network behaviours into a single universal resilience function, thereby allowing for convenient and accurate prediction of the system resilience. The network structure and human mobility parameters can clearly and simply express the epidemic threshold. Numerical experimental results on both real networks and star networks confirm the accuracy of the proposed dimension-reduction framework in predicting the evolution of epidemic dynamics on higher-order meta-population networks. Additionally, higher-order interactions among populations are shown to lead to explosive growth in the epidemic infection size potentially. Population mobility causes changes in the spatial distribution of infectious diseases across different regions.</description>

      <title>Economical representation of spatial networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network visualization is essential for many scientific, societal, technological and artistic domains. The primary goal is to highlight patterns out of nodes interconnected by edges that are easy to understand, facilitate communication and support decision-making. This is typically achieved by rearranging the nodes to minimize the edge crossings responsible of unintelligible and often unaesthetic trends. But when the nodes cannot be moved, as in spatial and physical networks, this procedure is not viable. Here, we overcome this situation by turning the edge crossing problem into a graph filtering optimization. We demonstrate that the presence of longer connections prompt the optimal solution to yield sparser networks, thereby limiting the number of intersections and getting more readable layouts. This theoretical result matches human behavior and provides an ecologically-inspired criterion to visualize and model real-world interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Network growth under opportunistic attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing network models can potentially be a useful tool in the development of economic theory. This work introduces an "opportunistic attachment" mechanism where incoming nodes, in deciding where to join a network, consider features of the entry points available to them. For example, an entrepreneur looking to start a thriving business might consider the expected revenue of many hypothetical businesses. This mechanism is explored, in isolation, via a minimal model where PageRank serves to score the available opportunities. Despite its simplicity, this model gives rise to rich node dynamics, path-dependence, and an unexpected degenerate structure. We go on to argue that this model might be useful to theoretical development as a maximally stylised model of entrepreneurial growth. Central to the argument is an alternative set of microfoundations introduced in Leontief &amp; Brody (1993) whereby the steady state of a random walk is a notion of economic equilibrium. To the extent this argument holds, our findings suggest that entrepreneurs face a shifting "opportunity space" where the number of potential business opportunities is effectively unbounded. Opportunistic attachment is thus a candidate mechanism for relating the structure of an economic system to its future growth.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Language in Social Media Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of digital platforms on user behavior presents foundational challenges, including issues related to polarization, misinformation dynamics, and variation in news consumption. Comparative analyses across platforms and over different years can provide critical insights into these phenomena. This study investigates the linguistic characteristics of user comments over 34 years, focusing on their complexity and temporal shifts. Utilizing a dataset of approximately 300 million English comments from eight diverse platforms and topics, we examine the vocabulary size and linguistic richness of user communications and their evolution over time. Our findings reveal consistent patterns of complexity across social media platforms and topics, characterized by a nearly universal reduction in text length, diminished lexical richness, but decreased repetitiveness. Despite these trends, users consistently introduce new words into their comments at a nearly constant rate. This analysis underscores that platforms only partially influence the complexity of user comments. Instead, it reflects a broader, universal pattern of human behaviour, suggesting intrinsic linguistic tendencies of users when interacting online.</description>

      <title>A Model for Economic Freedom on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum of human spaceflight initiatives continues to build toward Mars, and technological advances may eventually enable the potential for permanent space settlement. Aspirations for sustaining human life in space must be predicated on human factors, rather than technological constraints alone, and advances in models of governance and ethics are necessary as human civilization becomes a spacefaring species. This paper presents an idealistic but feasible model for economic freedom on Mars, which is situated within a framework in which Mars has been designated as a sovereign juridical peer to Earth. Under such conditions, Mars could maintain monetary stability through full reserve banking and a restriction on exchange with any fractional reserve Earth currencies, with a volume of circulating currency that changes based on the total population within fixed capacity infrastructure. Mars could maintain long-term political stability by diffusing the ownership of capital on Mars, which would allow all citizens of Mars to draw sufficient wealth from a combination of capital ownership and labor to live a good life. This model could also support limited tourism on Mars, in which real goods are exchanged for services but currency transactions between planets are prohibited. This model demonstrates the potential for a viable and sustainable economy on Mars that could conceivably be implemented, including on a sovereign Mars but also in other scenarios of space settlement. More broadly, this model illustrates that ideas such as diffuse capital ownership and limited government can enable freedom in space, and numerous models beyond a centralized world space agency should be explored to ensure the optimal governance of the emerging space economy.</description>

      <title>Local wealth condensation for yard-sale models with wealth-dependent biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Chakraborti's yard-sale model of an economy, identical agents engage in pairwise trades, resulting in wealth exchanges that conserve each agent's expected wealth. Doob's martingale convergence theorem immediately implies almost sure wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which a single agent owns the entire economy. If some pairs of agents are not allowed to trade with each other, the martingale convergence theorem still implies local wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which some agents are wealthy, while all their trading partners are impoverished. In this note, we propose a new, more elementary proof of this result. Unlike the proof based on the martingale convergence theorem, our argument applies to models with a wealth-acquired advantage, and even to certain models with a poverty-acquired advantage.</description>

      <title>The Topology of a Family Tree Graph and Its Members' Satisfaction with One Another: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Family members' satisfaction with one another is central to creating healthy and supportive family environments. In this work, we propose and implement a novel computational technique aimed at exploring the possible relationship between the topology of a given family tree graph and its members' satisfaction with one another. Through an extensive empirical evaluation ($N=486$ families), we show that the proposed technique brings about highly accurate results in predicting family members' satisfaction with one another based solely on the family graph's topology. Furthermore, the results indicate that our technique favorably compares to baseline regression models which rely on established features associated with family members' satisfaction with one another in prior literature.</description>

      <title>Fundamental dynamics of popularity-similarity trajectories in real networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real networks are complex dynamical systems, evolving over time with the addition and deletion of nodes and links. Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</description>
