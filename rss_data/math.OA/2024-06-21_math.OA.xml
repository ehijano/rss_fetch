      <title>The Kummer distribution in free probability, and its characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analogue of Kummer distribution in free probability. We prove characterization of free-Kummer and free Poisson distributions by freeness properties together with some assumptions about conditional moments. Our main tools are subordination of free multiplicative convolution and Boolean cumulants.</description>

      <title>Unitary Easy Quantum Groups Arising as Quantum Symmetry of Graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, T. Banica and R. Speicher introduced the orthogonal easy quantum group which can be completely determined using the combinations of set partitions. Later, P. Tarrago and M. Weber extended this formulation to another special class of compact matrix quantum groups, known as unitary easy quantum groups, which are quantum subgroups of the free unitary quantum group ($U_n^+$) containing $S_n$. On the other hand, the quantum symmetry of graph $C^{*}$-algebras has been explored by several mathematicians within different categories in the past few years. In this article, we establish that there are exactly three families of unitary easy quantum groups that can be achieved as the quantum symmetry of graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ associated with a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ in the category introduced by Joardar and Mandal. Moreover, we demonstrate that there does not exist any graph $C^*$-algebra associated with a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ having $A_{U^t}(F^{\Gamma})$ as the quantum automorphism group of $C^*(\Gamma)$ for non-scalar matrix $F^{\Gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Time and band limiting for exceptional polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "time-and-band limiting" commutative property was found and exploited by D. Slepian, H. Landau and H. Pollak at Bell Labs in the 1960's, and independently by M. Mehta and later by C. Tracy and H. Widom in Random matrix theory. The property in question is the existence of local operators with simple spectrum that commute with naturally appearing global ones.
  Here we give a general result that insures the existence of a commuting differential operator for a given family of exceptional orthogonal polynomials satisfying the "bispectral property". As a main tool we go beyond bispectrality and make use of the notion of Fourier Algebras associated to the given sequence of exceptional polynomials.
  We illustrate this result with two examples, of Hermite and Laguerre type, exhibiting also a nice Perline's form for the commuting differential operator.</description>

      <title>Interpolation theorems for conjugations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a separable complex Hilbert space. A conjugate-linear map $C:H\to H$ is a conjugation if it is an involutive isometry. In this paper, we consider the following interpolation problems: Let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{y_i\}_{i\in I}$ be two orthogonal sets of vectors in $H$, and let $N$ and $\{N_k\}_{k\in K}$ be normal operators such that the $N_k$'s mutually commute. Then, under which conditions does there exist a conjugation $C$ on $H$ such that
  (a) $Cx_i=y_i$ and $CN_kC=N_k^*$ for all $i\in I$ and $k\in K$; or
  (b) $Cx_i=y_i$, for every $i\in I$, and $CNC=-N^*$.
  We provide complete answers to problems (a) and (b). As a consequence of our results, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions of some equations in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$.</description>

      <title>Rings of almost everywhere defined functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the following representation theorem: A partially ordered commutative ring $R$ is a subring of a ring of almost everywhere defined continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ if and only if $R$ is archimedean and localizable. Here we assume that the positive cone of $R$ is closed under multiplication and stable under multiplication with squares, but we also show that one of these assumptions implies the other. An almost everywhere defined function on $X$ is one that is defined on a dense open subset of $X$. These functions can be added and multiplied pointwise so that the result is again almost everywhere defined. A partially ordered commutative ring $R$ is archimedean if the underlying additive partially ordered abelian group is archimedean, and $R$ is localizable essentially if its order is compatible with the construction of a localization with sufficiently large, positive denominators. As application we obtain several more specific representation theorems: representations by continuous real-valued functions on some topological space if $R$ is $\sigma$-bounded, and representation of lattice-ordered commutative rings ($f$-rings), of partially ordered fields, and of commutative operator algebras.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Takai and Treumann Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison result between two duality statements - Takai duality, which is implemented by the crossed product functor $- \rtimes G: KK^{G} \to KK^{\hat G}$ on equivariant Kasparov categories; and Treumann duality, which asserts the existence of an exotic equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories $\text{Mod}(KU_p[G])^{ft} \simeq \text{Mod}(KU_p[\hat G])^{ft}$ given by tensoring with a particular $(G,\hat G)$-bimodule $M_E$ and $p$-completing.</description>

      <title>Self-normalized Sums in Free Probability Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the distribution of self-normalized sums of free self-adjoint random variables converges weakly to Wigner's semicircle law under appropriate conditions and estimate the rate of convergence in terms of the Kolmogorov distance. In the case of free identically distributed self-adjoint bounded random variables, we retrieve the standard rate of order $n^{-1/2}$ up to a logarithmic factor, whereas we obtain a rate of order $n^{-1/4}$ in the corresponding unbounded setting. These results provide free versions of certain self-normalized limit theorems in classical probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a comprehensive framework to calculate the envelope of particular deformations of PostLie algebras. We have applied this framework to operator-valued non-commutative probability by introducing new transforms that enable the computation of conditionally free and conditionally monotone multiplicative convolutions of operator-valued non-commutative distributions.</description>

      <title>A route to quantum computing through the theory of quantum graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on our previous works, and in order to relate them with the theory of quantum graphs and the quantum computing principles, we once again try to introduce some newly developed technical structures just by relying on our toy example, the coordinate ring of $n\times n$ quantum matrix algebra $M_q(n)$, and the associated directed locally finite graphs $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$, and the Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-graph algebras. Meaningly, we introduce a $(4i-6)$-qubit quantum system by using the Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$-families associated to the $4i-6$ distinct Hamiltonian paths of $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$, for $i\in\{2,\cdots,n\}$. We also will present a proof of a claim raised in our previous paper concerning the graph $C^*$-algebra structure and the associated Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$-families.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-invertible channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a well-known result [Werner2001], Werner classified all tight quantum teleportation and dense coding schemes, showing that they correspond to unitary error bases. Here tightness is a certain dimensional restriction: the quantum system to be teleported and the entangled resource must be of dimension d, and the measurement must have d^2 outcomes.
  In this work we generalise this classification so as to remove the dimensional restriction altogether, thereby resolving an open problem raised in that work. In fact, we classify not just teleportation and dense coding schemes, but entanglement-reversible channels. These are channels between finite-dimensional C*-algebras which are reversible with the aid of an entangled resource state, generalising ordinary reversibility of a channel.
  In Werner's classification, a bijective correspondence between tight teleportation and dense coding schemes was shown: swapping Alice and Bob's operations turns a teleportation scheme into a dense coding scheme and vice versa. We observe that this property generalises ordinary invertibility of a channel; we call it entanglement-invertibility. We show that entanglement-invertible channels are precisely the quantum bijections previously studied in the setting of quantum combinatorics [Musto2018], which are classified in terms of the representation theory of the quantum permutation group.</description>
