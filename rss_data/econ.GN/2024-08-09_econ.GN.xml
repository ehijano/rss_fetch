      <title>Scarce Workers, High Wages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labor market tightness tremendously increased in Germany between 2012 and 2022. We analyze the effect of tightness on wages by combining social security data with unusually rich information on vacancies and job seekers. Instrumental variable regressions reveal positive elasticities between 0.004 and 0.011, implying that higher tightness explains between 7 and 19 percent of the real wage increase. We report greater elasticities for new hires, high-skilled workers, the Eastern German labor market, and the service sector. In particular, tightness raised wages at the bottom of the wage distribution, contributing to the decline in wage inequality over the last decade.</description>

      <title>Temptation: Immediacy and certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain? I test the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic discounting. In my experiment, workers allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks. I study dynamic consistency by comparing choices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is imminent. My novel design permits estimation of present-bias using a decision with a consequence that is both immediate and certain. I find greater present-bias when the consequence is certain. This finding has implications for any economic decision involving a present-biased decision-maker, including labor contracting and consumer good pricing. Finally I offer a methodological remedy for experimental economists.</description>
