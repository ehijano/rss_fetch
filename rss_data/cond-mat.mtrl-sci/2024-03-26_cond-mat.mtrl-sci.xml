      <title>Observation of polarization density waves in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the "failed" ferroelectric transition in SrTiO3 has been a long-standing puzzle in condensed matter physics. A compelling explanation is the competition between ferroelectricity and an instability with a mesoscopic modulation of the polarization. These polarization density waves, which should become especially strong near the quantum critical point, break local inversion symmetry and are difficult to probe with conventional x-ray scattering methods. Here we combine a femtosecond x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) with THz coherent control methods to probe inversion symmetry breaking at finite momenta and visualize the instability of the polarization on nanometer lengthscales in SrTiO3. We find polar-acoustic collective modes that are soft particularly at the tens of nanometer lengthscale. These precursor collective excitations provide evidence for the conjectured mesoscopic modulated phase in SrTiO3.</description>

      <title>Unified Differentiable Learning of the Electric Enthalpy and Dielectric Properties with Exact Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization and electric enthalpy functionals have paved the way to first-principles studies of polarization in crystalline, disordered and liquid materials. However, calculating the polarization in large-scale ab-initio molecular dynamics remains prohibitive due to the high computational cost involved. In this work, we introduce a machine-learning formulation that simultaneously learns to predict electric enthalpy, atomic forces, polarization, Born charges, and polarizability for a given atomic configuration. These quantities are derived through differentiation of the electric enthalpy with respect to atomic positions and electric field within a local equivariant representation of the atomic environment. Our new method exactly constrains the polarization to be a conservative vector field, obeys the acoustic sum rule for Born charges, and ensures the conservation of electric enthalpy in machine-learning molecular dynamics. Importantly, the formulation is general and does not necessarily require equivariance. The locality of the model enables the efficient calculation of vibrational and dielectric properties of materials over large length-scale and long time-scale molecular dynamics at quantum-mechanical accuracy. We apply our approach to determine the infrared spectrum and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of $\alpha$-SiO$_2$ using molecular dynamics, finding excellent agreement with results obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Additionally, we show that our model accurately captures the electric-field contributions to the electric enthalpy, forces, and polarization in reference to density functional theory calculations. This demonstrates the capability of our formulation to perform large-scale molecular dynamics under electric fields, thus paving the way to efficient and accurate studies of dielectric response of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Utilizing (Al, Ga)2O3/Ga2O3 superlattices to measure cation vacancy diffusion and vacancy-concentration-dependent diffusion of Al, Sn, and Fe in \b{eta} -Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion of native defects such as vacancies and their interactions with impurities are fundamental in semiconductor crystal growth, device processing, and long-term aging of equilibration and transient diffusion of vacancies are rarely investigated. We used aluminum-gallium oxide/gallium oxide superlattices (SLs) to detect and analyze transient diffusion of cation vacancies during annealing in O2 at 1000-1100 C. Using a novel finite difference scheme for the diffusion equation with time- and space-varying diffusion constant, we extract diffusion constants for Al, Fe, and cation vacancies under the given conditions, including the vacancy concentration dependence for Al. indicate that vacancies present in the substrate transiently diffuse through the SLs, interacting with Sn as it also diffuses. In the case of SLs grown on Sn-doped beta-gallium oxide substrates, gradients observed in the extent of Al diffusion indicate that vacancies present in the substrate transiently diffuse through the SLs, interacting with Sn as it also diffuses. In the case of SLs grown on (010) Fe-doped substrates, the Al diffusion is uniform through the SLs, indicating a depth-uniform concentration of vacancies. We find no evidence in either case for the introduction of gallium vacancies from the free surface at rates sufficient to affect Al diffusion down to ppm concentrations, which has important bearing on the validity of typically-made assumptions of vacancy equilibration. Additionally, we show that unintentional impurities in Sn-doped gallium oxide such as Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu, and Li also diffuse towards the surface and accumulate. Many of these likely have fast interstitial diffusion modes capable of destabilizing devices over time, thus highlighting the importance of controlling unintentional impurities in beta-gallium oxide wafers.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Polarization in Wurtzite Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization arising from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite lattice underpins the physics and functionality of gallium nitride (GaN)-the most produced semiconductor materials second only to silicon. However, recent direct experimental measurements unveiled remanent polarization of unexpectedly large magnitudes and opposite orientations to traditionally anticipated. This significant discrepancy not only poses a formidable challenge to our existing theoretical paradigms but also accentuates the need for a critical rethinking and methodological refinement to integrate these novel observations with established knowledge, mitigating potential misunderstandings and misconceptions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of unconventional moire ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity emerges in heterostructures consisting of nonpolar van der Waals (vdW) layers, greatly expanding the scope of two dimensional ferroelectrics. In particular, the unconventional moire ferroelectricity observed in bilayer graphene/boron nitride (BN) heterostructures, exhibits promising functionalities with topological current, superconductivity and synaptic responses. However, the debate about its mechanism - correlation driven charge transfer between two graphene layers - limits device reproducibility and hence large-scale production. Here by designing a single-layer graphene encapsulated by lattice-mismatched WSe2, we identify the ferroelectricity as stemming from - instead of graphene moire bands - the particular BN, where interfacial sliding ferroelectricity must play a role. With similar structures, multilayer twisted MoS2 is found to reproduce the ferroelectricity. The key is a conductive moire ferroelectric, where the screened gate and the pinned domain wall together result in unchanged electronic states, i.e. anomalous screening. The intimate connection to interfacial sliding ferroelectricity thus provides advantages of diverse choices of constituent materials and robust polarization switching while preserving the unique anomalous screening, paving the way to reproducible and reliable memory-based devices in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Large topological Hall effect arising from spin reorientation in kagome magnet Fe3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials systems with spin chirality can provide ultra-high-density, ultra-fast, and ultralow-power information carriers for digital transformation. These material systems include magnetic skyrmions, chiral domain walls, spin reorientation,and so on. The topological Hall effect (THE) has been identified as the most convenient and effective tool for detecting the presence of spin chirality in these systems. The research on the THE that may arise from spin reorientation and specifically in Fe3Ge with spin reorientation remains an unexplored area, so we study the THE in Fe3Ge Conduct systematic research. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results indicate that our Fe3Ge ribbon sample has a D019 structure. First-principles calculations and magnetic and electrical testing confirm spin reorientation in the Fe3Ge ribbon sample at 350 K.The Hall resistivity test results are consistent with our expectations, indicating the presence of the THE in the Fe3Ge ribbon sample. The topological Hall resistivity reaches a maximum value of 0.69 m{\Omega} cm at 400 K. For the first time, a detailed experimental study of the THE in Fe3Ge with spin reorientation has been conducted, introducing a new member to the family of THE.</description>

      <title>Non-coplanar spin structure in a metallic thin film of triangular lattice antiferromagnet CrSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antiferromagnetic metal with two-dimensional triangular network offers a unique playground of intriguing magneto-transport properties and functionalities stemming from interplay between conducting electrons and intricate magnetic phases. A NiAs-type CrSe is one of the candidates owing to alternate stackings of Cr and Se triangular atomic networks in its crystal structure. While fabrication of CrSe thin films is indispensable to develop functional devices, studies on its thin-film properties have been limited to date due to the lack of metallic samples. Here, we report on realization of metallic conductivities of CrSe thin films, which allows to investigate their intrinsic magneto-transport properties. The metallic sample exhibits co-occurrence of a weak ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the antiferromagnetic behavior, indicating the presence of non-coplanar spin structures. In addition, control of polarity and tilting angle of the non-coplanar spin structure is accomplished by a sign of cooling magnetic fields. The observed non-coplanar spin structure, which can be a source of emergent magnetic field acting on the conducting electrons, highlights a high potential of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet and provide unique platform for functional thin-film devices composed of NiAs-type derivative Cr chalcogenides and pnictides.</description>

      <title>Atomic observation on diamond (001) surfaces with non-contact atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve atomic-level characterization of the diamond (001) surface, persistent efforts have been made over the past few decades. The motivation behind the pursuit extends beyond investigating surface defects and adsorbates; it also involves unraveling the mystery of the smooth growth of diamond. However, the inherently low conductivity and the short C-C bonds render atomic resolution imaging exceptionally challenging. Here, we successfully overcame these challenges by employing non-contact atomic force microscopy with reactive Si tips. Atomic resolution imaging was achieved even at room temperature. With density-functional-theory calculations, we clarified that the critical factors for atomic resolution are in the formation of tilted C-Si bonds between scanning probes and surfaces, along with reordering of the surface C-C dimers. Implications of the findings extend beyond the realm of surface characterization. The present atomic-resolution microscopies drive future advancements in diamond technologies by providing avenues for identifying dopants and constructing artificial nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Determination of the dynamic Young's modulus of quantum materials in piezoactuator-driven uniaxial pressure cells using a low-frequency a.c. method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a new technique for measuring the dynamic Young's modulus, $E$, of quantum materials at low temperatures as a function of static tuning strain, $\epsilon$, in piezoactuator-driven pressure cells. In addition to a static tuning of stress and strain, we apply a small-amplitude, finite-frequency a.c. (1 Hz$ \lesssim \omega \lesssim $1000 Hz) uniaxial stress, $\sigma_{ac}$, to the sample and measure the resulting a.c. strain, $\epsilon_{ac}$, using a capacitive sensor to obtain the associated modulus $E$. We demonstrate the performance of the new technique through proof-of-principle experiments on the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is known for its rich temperature-strain phase diagram. In particular, we show that the magnitude of $E$, measured using this a.c. technique at low frequencies, exhibits a pronounced nonlinear elasticity, which is in very good agreement with previous Young's modulus measurements on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under [100] strain using a d.c. method (Noad et al., Science 382, 447-450 (2023)). By combining the new a.c. Young's modulus measurements with a.c. elastocaloric measurements in a single measurement, we demonstrate that these a.c. techniques are powerful in detecting small anomalies in the elastic properties of quantum materials. Finally, using the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as an example, we demonstrate how the imaginary component of the modulus can provide additional information about the nature of ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Points defects produced by irradiation: influence of boundary conditions on their biased elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the sinks able to absorb the point defects created under irradiation exhibit a stronger elastic interaction with the interstitial defect I than with the vacancy defect V. This bias of their elastic interaction (EB) is supposed to automatically determine the concomitant absorption bias (AB) leading to an elimination flux of I always larger than the flux of V. We show in this contribution that the link between the EB and the AB is not as rigid as thought previously. On a model system we can produce situations where this rule is in trouble: a sink which is primarily designed to attract more I than V can however absorb more V than I if it is located in the vicinity of another competing sink with prevalent elastic properties. As a consequence, the imbalance between the I and V fluxes absorbed by a given sink cannot be deduced univocally from its elastic interaction with the two defects because it is heavily influenced by the boundary conditions which are adopted to make the quantitative evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LNO) and lithium tantalate (LTO) see widespread use in fundamental research and commercial technologies reaching from electronics over classical optics to integrated quantum communication. In recent years, the mixed crystal system lithium niobate tantalate (LNT) allows for the dedicate engineering of material properties by combining the advantages of the two parental materials LNO and LTO. Vibrational spectroscopies such as Raman spectroscopy or (Fourier transform) infrared spectroscopy are vital techniques to provide detailed insight into the material properties, which is central to the analysis and optimization of devices. In this work, we present a joint experimental-theoretical approach allowing to unambiguously assign the spectral features in the LNT material family through both Raman and IR spectroscopy, as well as to provide an in-depth explanation for the observed scattering efficiencies based on first-principles calculations. The phononic contribution to the static dielectric tensor is calculated from the experimental and theoretical data using the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation and compared with the results of the first-principles calculations. The joint methodology can be readily expanded to other materials and serves, e.g., as the basis for studying the role of point defects or doping.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric to paraelectric structural transition in LiTaO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition in LiTaO$_3$ and in pure as well as Mg doped LiNbO$_3$ is investigated theoretically by atomistic calculations in the framework of the density functional theory, as well as experimentally by calorimetry and electrical conductivity measurements. First principles models within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) allow to consider anharmonic effects and thus to obtain a realistic estimate of the Curie temperature $T_C$ of both ferroelectrics. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations performed on large supercells confirm the Curie temperatures estimated with the SSCHA approach. Moreover, they also suggest that the structural phase transition is a continuous process beginning at temperatures well below $T_C$. According to AIMD, significant ionic displacements occurr already at temperatures of about 100\,K and 300\,K below $T_C$ in LiTaO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$, respectively. To asses whether and how far the ionic displacements affect the materials properties, the AIMD results are compared with measurements of the electrical conductivity and of the heat capacity across the phase transition. Our first principles calculations moreover show that Mg ions, a frequently employed dopant, raise the Curie temperature in LiNbO$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$ solid solutions are investigated from first principles and by optical spectroscopy. The ground- and excited-state properties of the solid solutions are modelled within density functional theory as a function of the Ta concentration using special quasirandom structures spanning the entire composition range between LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$. Deviations from a Vegard behavior are predicted for the lattice parameters, the heat capacity, the electronic bandgap, and consequently the absorption edge. The latter is measured for crystals of different composition by low temperature optical spectroscopy, qualitatively confirming the theoretical predictions. The LiNb$_{0.11}$Ta$_{0.89}$O$_3$ composition is found to be a highly unusual crystal with a permanent macroscopic electric polarization and nonetheless zero birefringence.</description>

      <title>Simulation of hydrogen adsorption in hierarchical silicalite: Role of electrostatics and surface chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption in nanoporous materials is one strategy that can be used to store hydrogen at conditions of temperature and pressure that are economically viable. Adsorption capacity of nanoporous materials depends on surface area which can be enhanced by incorporating a hierarchical pore structure. We report grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation results on the adsorption of hydrogen in hierarchical models of silicalite that incorporate 4 nm wide mesopores in addition to the 0.5 nm wide micropores at 298 K, using different force fields to model hydrogen. Our results suggest that incorporating mesopores in silicalite can enhance adsorption by at least 20% if electrostatic interactions are not included and up to 100% otherwise. Incorporating electrostatic interactions results in higher adsorption by close to 100% at lower pressures for hierarchical silicalite whereas for unmodified silicalite, it is less significant at all pressures. Hydroxylating the mesopore surface in hierarchical silicalite results in an enhancement in adsorption at pressures below 1 atm and suppression by up to 20 % at higher pressures. Temperature dependence at selected pressures exhibits expected decrease in adsorption amounts at higher temperatures. These findings can be useful in the engineering, selection, and optimization of nanoporous materials for hydrogen storage.</description>

Abstract: LaCuSb$_{2}$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of about $T_\text{c} = 0.9$K and is a potential platform where Dirac fermions can be experimentally observed. In this paper, we report systematic high-resolution studies of its electronic structure using the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) technique supported by the DFT calculation. The Fermi surface consists of four branches, of which the two inner ones are more 3-dimensional and the theoretical calculations reproduce well the experiment. We observe several linear dispersions forming Dirac-like structures. The nodal lines are present in the system along ${\text{M}}$-${\text{A}}$ and ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ and Dirac crossings along ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ are observed by ARPES. Finally, the nesting between external Fermi surface pockets, which corresponds to charge density wave (CDW) modulation vector is enhanced in LaCuSb$_{2}$ as compared to LaAgSb$_{2}$, while CDW appears in the latter system.</description>

      <title>Facet formation in slow three-dimensional fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cracks develop various surface patterns as they propagate in three-dimensional (3D) materials. Facet formation in nominally tensile (mode-I) fracture emerge in the slow, non-inertial regime and oftentimes takes the form of surface steps. We show that the same phase-field framework that recently shed basic light on dynamic (inertial) tensile fracture in 3D, also gives rise to crack surface steps. Step formation is shown to be an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon that involves two essential physical ingredients: finite-strength quenched disorder and a small, mesoscopic anti-plane shear (mode-III) loading component (on top of the dominant tensile, mode-I loading component). We quantify the interplay between disorder (both its strength and spatial correlation length) and mesoscopic mode I+III mixity in controlling step formation. Finally, we show that surface steps grow out of the small-scale, background surface roughness and are composed of two overlapping crack segments connected by a bridging crack, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>One-step architecture of bifunctional petal-like oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDHs nanosheets for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors and urea oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising electrode materials in the fields of energy storage (supercapacitors) and conversion (urea oxidation). The rational construction of atomic and electronic structure is crucial for nickel-based LDHs to realize their satisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a facile, ecofriendly, one-step synthesis process to construct petal-like oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDH nanosheets for hybrid super-capacitors (HSCs) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The asprepared NiAl-LDH nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies possess a large specific surface area of 216.6 m2 g-1 and a desirable electronic conductivity of 3.45 * 10-4 S cm-1 to deliver an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2801 F g-1 (700 C g-1) at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, high specific energy of 50.0 W h kg-1 at 400 W kg-1 and excellent cycle stability with 91% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles are achieved by the NiAl-LDHs/CFP (carbon fiber paper) (+)//YP-80F (a commercial activated carbon) (-) HSC. Besides, NiAl-LDH nanosheets also work as an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR, which only requires 1.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to drive 10 mA cm-2 in 1 mol L-1 KOH with 0.33 mol L-1 urea. This remarkable performance is superior to most reported values of previous candidates owing to the thin structure of NiAl-LDH nanosheets for exposing more active sites and abundant oxygen vacancies. In addition, various reaction parameters are investigated to optimize the electrochemical performance. In general, this work paves a new way for the architecture of multifunctional nanostructured energy materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains a challenge. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range CDW order with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ is observed, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of the long-range CDW order $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ at lower temperature. In conflict with these observations, theoretical calculations overestimate the transition temperature by a few thousand Kelvin and incorrectly predict the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order to be the ground state. Here, we develop a theory of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ based on anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory. We predict a temperature-driven phase transition from the high-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW to the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW order, fully explaining experimental observations. Additionally, we clarify that both multi-phonon effects and semi-core electron states play a crucial role in stabilizing the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ order. Finally, we construct a phase diagram of the competing CDWs in the lattice parameter space and demonstrate that the out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a pivotal role in manipulating the competing CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving ealier discrepancies between theory and experiment. Overall, our work contributes to the wider effort of understanding CDWs in the kagome metal family.</description>

      <title>Magnetic vs. nonmagnetic polymorphs of RuBr$_3$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure evolution of the crystal structure and magnetism of the honeycomb $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ is studied using high-pressure x-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and density-functional band-structure calculations. Hydrostatic compression transforms antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ ($R\bar 3$) into paramagnetic $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ ($P\bar 1$) where short Ru-Ru bonds cause magnetism collapse above 1.3 GPa at 0 K and 2.5 GPa at 295 K. Below this critical pressure, the N\'eel temperature of $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ increases with the slope of 1.8 K/GPa. Pressure tunes $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ away from the Kitaev limit, whereas increased third-neighbor in-plane coupling and interlayer coupling lead to a further stabilization of the collinear zigzag state. Both $\alpha$- and $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ are metastable at ambient pressure, but their transformation into the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-polymorph is kinetically hindered at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin-state ordering and intermediate states in the mixed-valence cobalt oxyborate Co$_3$O$_2$BO$_3$ with spin crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-state ordering - a periodic pattern of ions with different spin-state configurations along a crystal lattice - is a rare phenomenon, and its possible interrelation with other electronic degrees of freedom remains little explored. Here we perform a structural investigation of the mixed-valence Co homometallic ludwigite Co$_2^{2+}$Co$^{3+}$O$_2$BO$_3$. A superstructure consistent with a long-range Co$^{3+}$ spin-state ordering is observed between $T_{4}=580$ K and $T_{3}=510$ K. Intermediate states with mesoscopic correlations are detected below $T_{3}$ down to $T_{1}=480$ K with a change of dimensionality at $T_{2}=495$ K. The spin-state correlations are connected to the charge sector as revealed by the abrupt changes in the electrical resistance at $T_1$ and $T_2$. The evolution of the structural parameters below $T_{1}$ indicate that the spin crossover is ignited by a moderate degree of thermally-induced Co$^{2+}$/Co$^{3+}$ charge disorder. Charge and spin-state degrees of freedom can be interrelated in mixed-valence spin-crossover materials, leading to sharp transitions involving intermediate spin-state/charge correlated states at the mesoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In $\geq$ 75%) are potentially useful for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor. In this report, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility to 545,000 cm^2/V s, which is the highest reported mobility for high In content InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.</description>

Abstract: We report THz-pump / mid-infrared probe near-field studies on Si-doped GaAs-InGaAs core-shell nanowires utilizing THz radiation from the free-electron laser FELBE. Upon THz excitation of free carriers, we observe a red shift of the plasma resonance in both amplitude and phase spectra, which we attribute to the heating up of electrons in the conduction band. The simulation of heated electron distributions anticipates a significant electron population in both L- and X-valleys. The two-temperature model is utilized for a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the electron gas temperature under THz pumping at various power levels.</description>

Abstract: Active nematics are materials composed of mobile, elongated particles that can transform energy from the environment into a mechanical motion. Current experimental realizations of the active nematics are of biological origin and include cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria in liquid crystal, and combinations of bio-filaments with molecular motors. Here, we report the realization of a fully synthetic active nematic system comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves. This artificial active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits stable material properties, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. We demonstrate that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long-range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability, development of active turbulence, and proliferation of topological defects. We reveal the emergence of unconventional free-standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active nematic fluids with stable material properties and tunable topological defects dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Polymer Arrays: High Aspect Ratio Surface Structures and Their Digital Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by adhesive bio-filamentous structure, such as bacterial pili, this work details the methods used to fabricate and characterize a surface-anchored array of thin, flexible and shape-responsive mesoscale polymer ribbons with a length-to-thickness aspect ratio of up to 100,000. The resulting structures exhibit geometrically complex and dynamic morphologies consistent with elastocapillary bending that experience an increase in curvature over hours of aging due to creep. We develop a computational image analysis framework to generate 3D reconstructions of these densely crowded geometries and extract quantitative descriptors to demonstrate morphological changes due to aging. We demonstrate the robustness of this quantitative method by characterizing the creep-induced change in an aging ribbon array's shape and develop a scaling relationship to describe the importance of ribbon thickness for shape and dynamical observations. These methods demonstrate an essential baseline to probe morphology-property relationships of mesoscale polymer ribbon arrays fabricated from a variety of materials in numerous environments. Through the introduction of perfluorodecalin droplets, we illustrate the potential of these ribbon arrays towards applications in adhesive, microrobotic, and biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Raman peak shift and broadening in crystalline nanoparticles with lattice impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of point-like lattice impurities on nanoparticle Raman spectra (RS) is studied using both numerical and analytical methods. Particular cases of replacement atoms of various masses, vacancies, and disorder in interatomic bonds are considered. It is shown that the disorder leads not only to the broadening of optical phonon lines but also to the shift of the corresponding Raman peak. The latter can be either positive (i.e., blueshift) or negative (redshift) depending on the type of impurities. Thus there is an additional contribution to the well-known redshift that occurs due to the size-quantization (confinement) effect. Considering nanometer-sized diamond particles as a representative example, we show that the broadening and the shift are, as a rule, of the same order of magnitude. The results are discussed in the framework of the self-consistent T-matrix approach. It is argued that both effects should be considered for accurate treatment of experimental Raman spectra. Simple recipes to do so are formulated for several important cases including NV centers in nanodiamonds.</description>

Abstract: We report the magnetic structure and properties of a thiocyanate-based honeycomb magnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$ which crystallises in the unusual low-symmetry trigonal space group $P\overline{3}$. Magnetic measurements on powder samples show this material is an antiferromagnet (ordering temperature ($T_\mathrm{N,mag} = 18.1(6)\,$)K) and can be described by nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions $J=-11.07(4)\,$K. A method for growing neutron-diffraction sized single crystals (\textgreater10 mm$^3$) is demonstrated. Low temperature neutron single crystal diffraction shows that the compound adopts the collinear antiferromagnetic structure with $T_\mathrm{N,neut}= 18.94(7)\,$K, magnetic space group $P \bar{3}'$. Low temperature second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements provide no evidence of breaking of the centre of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors. However, the understanding of its underlying mechanism has long been phenomenological without a clear microscopic description. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, resulting a mini gap which effectively lowered the energy of vortex and caused the pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force through the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results align with the bulk critical current measurement. We further show that a general microscopic quantum model with considering defect-vortex interaction can well capture our observation. It indicates the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus revealed a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has revolutionized our everyday lives and research. The concept of inverse design, which involves defining a functionality by a human and then using an algorithm to search for the device's design, opened new perspectives for information processing. A specialized AI-driven processor capable of solving an inverse problem in real-time offers a compelling alternative to the time and energy-intensive CMOS computations. Here, we report on a magnon-based processor that uses a complex reconfigurable medium to process data in the gigahertz range, catering to the demands of 5G and 6G telecommunication. Demonstrating its versatility, the processor solves inverse problems using two algorithms to realize RF notch filters and demultiplexers. The processor also exhibits potential for binary, reservoir, and neuromorphic computing paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective regulation of the morphology of transition metal spinel structures is crucial for creating efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis of water. In this work, micro-flower NiCo2O4 (F-NCO) assembled by nanosheets via a chemical template method for the simultaneous promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electronic microscope analysis revealed that the thickness of the F-NCO catalyst was only 2.7% of that of the NiCo2O4 bulk (B-NCO), and this ultrathin lamellar structure was conducive to further exposure of the active site and improved reaction kinetics. The F-NCO catalyst exhibited superior HER and OER performance (10 = 236 and 310 mV) and robust long-term stability over the B-NCO catalyst in 1.0 M KOH, with a 2.68-fold and 4.16-fold increase in active surface area and a 0.42-fold and 0.61-fold decrease in charge transfer resistance values, respectively. This micro-flower-structured electrode has remarkable electrocatalytic property and long-term durability, providing a novel insight for characterizing cost-effective and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent quasi-particle $GW$ and hybrid functional calculations for Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions: band offset and spin-orbit coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

Abstract: In Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au deposited on silicon substrate the interaction between spin waves and surface acoustic waves is observed by Brillion light scattering spectroscopy. We show that by changing the number of receptions in the multilayer we can tune the dispersion of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) not affecting significantly fundamentals spin wave (SW) mode. As a result, we can control (activate or deactivate) the magnetoelastic interaction between fundamental SW mode and SAWs by the thickness of the magnetostrictive multilayer.</description>

      <title>JARVIS-Leaderboard: A Large Scale Benchmark of Materials Design Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lack of rigorous reproducibility and validation are major hurdles for scientific development across many fields. Materials science in particular encompasses a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches that require careful benchmarking. Leaderboard efforts have been developed previously to mitigate these issues. However, a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking on an integrated platform with multiple data modalities with both perfect and defect materials data is still lacking. This work introduces JARVIS-Leaderboard, an open-source and community-driven platform that facilitates benchmarking and enhances reproducibility. The platform allows users to set up benchmarks with custom tasks and enables contributions in the form of dataset, code, and meta-data submissions. We cover the following materials design categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electronic Structure (ES), Force-fields (FF), Quantum Computation (QC) and Experiments (EXP). For AI, we cover several types of input data, including atomic structures, atomistic images, spectra, and text. For ES, we consider multiple ES approaches, software packages, pseudopotentials, materials, and properties, comparing results to experiment. For FF, we compare multiple approaches for material property predictions. For QC, we benchmark Hamiltonian simulations using various quantum algorithms and circuits. Finally, for experiments, we use the inter-laboratory approach to establish benchmarks. There are 1281 contributions to 274 benchmarks using 152 methods with more than 8 million data-points, and the leaderboard is continuously expanding. The JARVIS-Leaderboard is available at the website: https://pages.nist.gov/jarvis_leaderboard</description>

      <title>On-the-fly training of polynomial machine learning potentials in computing lattice thermal conductivity</title>

Abstract: The application of first-principles calculations for predicting lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) in crystalline materials, in conjunction with the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation, has gained increasing popularity. In this calculation, the determination of force constants through first-principles calculations is critical for accurate LTC predictions. For material exploration, performing first-principles LTC calculations in a high-throughput manner is now expected, although it requires significant computational resources. To reduce computational demands while preserving accuracy moderately, we integrated polynomial machine learning potentials on-the-fly during the first-principles LTC calculations. This paper presents a systematic approach to first-principles LTC calculations. We designed and optimized an efficient workflow that integrates multiple modular software packages. We applied this approach to calculate LTCs for 103 compounds of the wurtzite, zincblende, and rocksalt types to evaluate the performance of the polynomial machine learning potentials in LTC calculations. We demonstrate a significant reduction in the computational resources required for the LTC predictions, while maintaining reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Validation Workflow for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Complex Ceramics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of published Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has increased significantly in recent years. These new data-driven potential energy approximations often lack the physics-based foundations that inform many traditionally-developed interatomic potentials and hence require robust validation methods for their applicability, accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability to the intended applications. This work presents a sequential, three-stage workflow for MLIP validation: (i) preliminary validation, (ii) static property prediction, and (iii) dynamic property prediction. This material-agnostic procedure is demonstrated in a tutorial approach for the development of a robust MLIP for boron carbide (B4C), a widely employed, structurally complex ceramic that undergoes a deleterious deformation mechanism called "amorphization" under high-pressure loading. It is shown that the resulting B4C MLIP offers a more accurate prediction of properties compared to the available empirical potential.</description>

      <title>Phase Transformation in Lithium Niobate-Lithium Tantalate Solid Solutions (LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of the structural phase transition in the vicinity of the Curie temperature $T_c$ of LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$ crystals is motivated by the expected combination of advantageous high-temperature properties of LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, including high piezoelectric modules and remarkable high-temperature stability, respectively. $T_c$ marks the ultimate limit for exploiting the piezoelectric properties, however transition related structural modifications might impact this and other properties even below $T_c$. Remarkably, the phase transition from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase, whose temperature strongly depends on the composition $x$, shows a significant drop in the activation energy of the electrical conductivity. The magnitude, temperature dependence and underlying mechanisms of this drop are discussed from a microscopic perspective. Molecular dynamics calculations in the framework of the density functional theory show that substantial displacements of the cations occur below $T_c$ for both the end compounds LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, and might thus affect the electrical conductivity. Above $T_c$, the migration of lithium ions is presumably facilitated by a shortened diffusion path for the most favorable jump of the lithium ions. Electronic contributions to the conductivity, which become important above 900 K, are explained within the polaronic picture by the formation and migration of free small polarons.</description>

      <title>Shotgun crystal structure prediction using machine-learned formation energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stable or metastable crystal structures of assembled atoms can be predicted by finding the global or local minima of the energy surface defined on the space of the atomic configurations. Generally, this requires repeated first-principles energy calculations that are impractical for large systems, such as those containing more than 30 atoms in the unit cell. Here, we have made significant progress in solving the crystal structure prediction problem with a simple but powerful machine-learning workflow; using a machine-learning surrogate for first-principles energy calculations, we performed non-iterative, single-shot screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures. The present method relies on two key technical components: transfer learning, which enables a highly accurate energy prediction of pre-relaxed crystalline states given only a small set of training samples from first-principles calculations, and generative models to create promising and diverse crystal structures for screening. Here, first-principles calculations were performed only to generate the training samples, and for the optimization of a dozen or fewer finally narrowed-down crystal structures. Our shotgun method proved to be computationally less demanding compared to conventional methods, which heavily rely on iterations of first-principles calculations, and achieved an exceptional prediction accuracy, reaching 92.2\% in a benchmark task involving the prediction of 90 different crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Electronic Phase Propagation Speed in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ Revealed by Dilatometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal expansion offers deep insights into phase transitions in condensed matter physics. Utilizing an advanced AC-temperature dilatometer with picometer resolution, this study clearly resolves the antiferromagnetic and structural transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$. The implementation of temperature oscillation reveals a hysteresis near the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{N}$ with unprecedented resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that the hysteretic width exhibits a universal dependence on the parameters of temperature oscillation and the sample's longidutinal dimension, which in turn reveals a finite transition speed. Our quantitative analysis shows that this phase boundary propagates at a mere 188 $\mu$m/s - a speed seven orders of magnitude slower than acoustic waves. It suggests a hidden thermodynamic constraint imposed by the electronic degrees of freedom. Our research not only sheds light on the dynamics of phase transitions between different correlated phases, but also establishes high precision dilatometry as a powerful tool for material studies. This measurement technique, when properly modified, can be extended to studies of other material properties such as piezoelectric, magneto-restriction, elastic modulus, etc.</description>

      <title>Pressure effects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of infinite-layer nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of superconductivity in NbTi, the workhorse for many applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, NbTi turns out to be a major challenge for computational superconductivity. In fact, anharmonic effects are crucial to obtain dynamically stable phonons for the ordered bcc phase, unstable at the harmonic level, and beyond-Morel Anderson effects in the Coulomb interaction reduce the Tc by more than 20%. Lattice disorder causes an additional large discrepancy in $T_c$ compared to experiment. Our results imply that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant superconductors requires methodological developments beyond the current standards.</description>
