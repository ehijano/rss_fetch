      <title>The Impact of Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) on Website Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web traffic relies on 2048-bit RSA encryption to secure our data in transit. Rapid advances in Quantum Computing pose a grave challenge by allowing hackers to break this encryption in hours. In August of 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) standards, including CRYSTALS-Kyber for general encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. Despite this proactive approach, the slow adoption of encryption protocols remains a concern, leaving a significant portion of data vulnerable to interception. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the impact of NIST's Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms on website response times, particularly focusing on SSL handshake time and total download time under varying network conditions. By assessing the performance of these algorithms, this research seeks to provide empirical evidence and a reusable framework for validating the efficacy of QSC in real-world scenarios. It was found that the QSC algorithms outperformed the classical algorithm under normal and congested network conditions. There was also found to be an improvement in the total download time for larger file sizes, and a better performance by QSC under higher latency and packet loss conditions. Therefore, this study recommends that websites switch to QSC when the standards are ratified. These insights are crucial for accelerating the adoption of QSC and ensuring the security of data in the face of quantum computing threats.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Privacy Risks in LLM Embeddings from Embedding Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embeddings have become a cornerstone in the functionality of large language models (LLMs) due to their ability to transform text data into rich, dense numerical representations that capture semantic and syntactic properties. These embedding vector databases serve as the long-term memory of LLMs, enabling efficient handling of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, the surge in popularity of embedding vector databases in LLMs has been accompanied by significant concerns about privacy leakage. Embedding vector databases are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion attacks, where adversaries can exploit the embeddings to reverse-engineer and extract sensitive information from the original text data. Existing defense mechanisms have shown limitations, often struggling to balance security with the performance of downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Eguard, a novel defense mechanism designed to mitigate embedding inversion attacks. Eguard employs a transformer-based projection network and text mutual information optimization to safeguard embeddings while preserving the utility of LLMs. Our approach significantly reduces privacy risks, protecting over 95% of tokens from inversion while maintaining high performance across downstream tasks consistent with original embeddings.</description>

      <title>Intellectual Property Protection for Deep Learning Model and Dataset Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing applications of Deep Learning (DL), especially recent spectacular achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, the commercial significance of these remarkable models has soared. However, acquiring well-trained models is costly and resource-intensive. It requires a considerable high-quality dataset, substantial investment in dedicated architecture design, expensive computational resources, and efforts to develop technical expertise. Consequently, safeguarding the Intellectual Property (IP) of well-trained models is attracting increasing attention. In contrast to existing surveys overwhelmingly focusing on model IPP mainly, this survey not only encompasses the protection on model level intelligence but also valuable dataset intelligence. Firstly, according to the requirements for effective IPP design, this work systematically summarizes the general and scheme-specific performance evaluation metrics. Secondly, from proactive IP infringement prevention and reactive IP ownership verification perspectives, it comprehensively investigates and analyzes the existing IPP methods for both dataset and model intelligence. Additionally, from the standpoint of training settings, it delves into the unique challenges that distributed settings pose to IPP compared to centralized settings. Furthermore, this work examines various attacks faced by deep IPP techniques. Finally, we outline prospects for promising future directions that may act as a guide for innovative research.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Deceiving: Exploitation of Visual Pathways in Multi-Modal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by combining visual and text data, making applications like image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-modal content creation possible. This ability to understand and work with complex information has made MLLMs useful in areas such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and digital content. However, integrating multiple types of data also creates security risks. Attackers can manipulate either the visual or text inputs, or both, to make the model produce unintended or even harmful responses. This paper reviews how visual inputs in MLLMs can be exploited by various attack strategies. We break down these attacks into categories: simple visual tweaks and cross-modal manipulations, as well as advanced strategies like VLATTACK, HADES, and Collaborative Multimodal Adversarial Attack (Co-Attack). These attacks can mislead even the most robust models while looking nearly identical to the original visuals, making them hard to detect. We also discuss the broader security risks, including threats to privacy and safety in important applications. To counter these risks, we review current defense methods like the SmoothVLM framework, pixel-wise randomization, and MirrorCheck, looking at their strengths and limitations. We also discuss new methods to make MLLMs more secure, including adaptive defenses, better evaluation tools, and security approaches that protect both visual and text data. By bringing together recent developments and identifying key areas for improvement, this review aims to support the creation of more secure and reliable multi-modal AI systems for real-world use.</description>

      <title>The impact of mobility, beam sweeping and smart jammers on security vulnerabilities of 5G cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of 5G networks to jamming attacks has emerged as a significant concern. This paper contributes in two primary aspects. Firstly, it investigates the effect of a multi-jammer on 5G cell metrics, specifically throughput and goodput. The investigation is conducted within the context of a mobility model for user equipment (UE), with a focus on scenarios involving connected vehicles (CVs) engaged in a mission. Secondly, the vulnerability of synchronization signal block (SSB) components is examined concerning jamming power and beam sweeping. Notably, the study reveals that increasing jamming power beyond 40 dBm in our specific scenario configuration no longer decreases network throughput due to the re-transmission of packets through the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) process. Furthermore, it is observed that under the same jamming power, the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) is more vulnerable than the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS). However, a smart jammer can disrupt the cell search process by injecting less power and targeting PSS-SSS or physical broadcast channel (PBCH) data compared to a barrage jammer. On the other hand, beam sweeping proves effective in mitigating the impact of a smart jammer, reducing the error vector magnitude root mean square from 51.59% to 23.36% under the same jamming power.</description>

      <title>PentestAgent: Incorporating LLM Agents to Automated Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penetration testing is a critical technique for identifying security vulnerabilities, traditionally performed manually by skilled security specialists. This complex process involves gathering information about the target system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting findings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is time-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and resources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration testing methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world applications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and implementation.
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and automation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant challenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of comprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose PentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that leverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and automate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion and overall efficiency. This work significantly advances the practical applicability of automated penetration testing systems.</description>

      <title>QuanCrypt-FL: Quantized Homomorphic Encryption with Pruning for Secure Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading approach for decentralized machine learning, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging private data. While FL enhances data privacy, it remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as gradient inversion and membership inference, during both training and inference phases. Homomorphic Encryption provides a promising solution by encrypting model updates to protect against such attacks, but it introduces substantial communication overhead, slowing down training and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose QuanCrypt-FL, a novel algorithm that combines low-bit quantization and pruning techniques to enhance protection against attacks while significantly reducing computational costs during training. Further, we propose and implement mean-based clipping to mitigate quantization overflow or errors. By integrating these methods, QuanCrypt-FL creates a communication-efficient FL framework that ensures privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy, thereby improving both computational efficiency and attack resilience. We validate our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. QuanCrypt-FL consistently outperforms existing method and matches Vanilla-FL in terms of accuracy across varying client. Further, QuanCrypt-FL achieves up to 9x faster encryption, 16x faster decryption, and 1.5x faster inference compared to BatchCrypt, with training time reduced by up to 3x.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Robustness of Watermarking to Paraphrasing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst rising concerns about the internet being proliferated with content generated from language models (LMs), watermarking is seen as a principled way to certify whether text was generated from a model. Many recent watermarking techniques slightly modify the output probabilities of LMs to embed a signal in the generated output that can later be detected. Since early proposals for text watermarking, questions about their robustness to paraphrasing have been prominently discussed. Lately, some techniques are deliberately designed and claimed to be robust to paraphrasing. However, such watermarking schemes do not adequately account for the ease with which they can be reverse-engineered. We show that with access to only a limited number of generations from a black-box watermarked model, we can drastically increase the effectiveness of paraphrasing attacks to evade watermark detection, thereby rendering the watermark ineffective.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rewinding for IOP-Based Succinct Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the post-quantum security of succinct interactive arguments constructed from interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) and vector commitment schemes. We prove that an interactive variant of the BCS transformation is secure in the standard model against quantum adversaries when the vector commitment scheme is collapsing. Our proof builds on and extends prior work on the post-quantum security of Kilians succinct interactive argument, which is instead based on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). We introduce a new quantum rewinding strategy that works across any number of rounds. As a consequence of our results, we obtain standard-model post-quantum secure succinct arguments with the best asymptotic complexity known.</description>

      <title>Palermo: Improving the Performance of Oblivious Memory using Protocol-Hardware Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides the memory access patterns, enhancing data privacy by preventing attackers from discovering sensitive information based on the sequence of memory accesses. The performance of ORAM is often limited by its inherent trade-off between security and efficiency, as concealing memory access patterns imposes significant computational and memory overhead. While prior works focus on improving the ORAM performance by prefetching and eliminating ORAM requests, we find that their performance is very sensitive to workload locality behavior and incurs additional management overhead caused by the ORAM stash pressure.
  This paper presents Palermo: a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM performance. The key observation in Palermo is that classical ORAM protocols enforce restrictive dependencies between memory operations that result in low memory bandwidth utilization. Palermo introduces a new protocol that overlaps large portions of memory operations, within a single and between multiple ORAM requests, without breaking correctness and security guarantees. Subsequently, we propose an ORAM controller architecture that executes the proposed protocol to service ORAM requests. The hardware is responsible for concurrently issuing memory requests as well as imposing the necessary dependencies to ensure a consistent view of the ORAM tree across requests. Using a rich workload mix, we demonstrate that Palermo outperforms the RingORAM baseline by 2.8x, on average, incurring a negligible area overhead of 5.78mm^2 (less than 2% in 12th generation Intel CPU after technology scaling) and 2.14W without sacrificing security. We further show that Palermo also outperforms the state-of-the-art works PageORAM, PrORAM, and IR-ORAM.</description>

      <title>Dave: a decentralized, secure, and lively fraud-proof algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new fraud-proof algorithm that offers an unprecedented combination of decentralization, security, and liveness. The resources that must be mobilized by an honest participant to defeat an adversary grow only logarithmically with what the adversary ultimately loses. As a consequence, there is no need to introduce high bonds that prevent an adversary from creating too many Sybils. This makes the system very inclusive and frees participants from having to pool resources among themselves to engage the protocol. Finally, the maximum delay to finalization also grows only logarithmically with total adversarial expenditure, with the smallest multiplicative factor to date. In summary: the entire dispute completes in 2--5 challenge periods, the only way to break consensus is to censor the honest party for more than one challenge period, and the costs of engaging in the dispute are minimal.</description>

      <title>EUREKHA: Enhancing User Representation for Key Hackers Identification in Underground Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground forums serve as hubs for cybercriminal activities, offering a space for anonymity and evasion of conventional online oversight. In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation as Instruction Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obfuscation of computer programs has historically been approached either as a practical but \textit{ad hoc} craft to make reverse engineering subjectively difficult, or as a sound theoretical investigation unfortunately detached from the numerous existing constraints of engineering practical systems.
  In this paper, we propose \textit{instruction decorrelation} as a new approach that makes the instructions of a set of real-world programs appear independent from one another. We contribute: a formal definition of \textit{instruction independence} with multiple instantiations for various aspects of programs; a combination of program transformations that meet the corresponding instances of instruction independence against an honest-but-curious adversary, specifically random interleaving and memory access obfuscation; and an implementation of an interpreter that uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) only to perform memory address translation and memory shuffling, leaving instructions execution outside the TEE.
  These first steps highlight the practicality of our approach. Combined with additional techniques to protect the content of memory and to hopefully lower the requirements on TEEs, this work could potentially lead to more secure obfuscation techniques that could execute on commonly available hardware.</description>

      <title>Towards a Re-evaluation of Data Forging Attacks in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data forging attacks provide counterfactual proof that a model was trained on a given dataset, when in fact, it was trained on another. These attacks work by forging (replacing) mini-batches with ones containing distinct training examples that produce nearly identical gradients. Data forging appears to break any potential avenues for data governance, as adversarial model owners may forge their training set from a dataset that is not compliant to one that is. Given these serious implications on data auditing and compliance, we critically analyse data forging from both a practical and theoretical point of view, finding that a key practical limitation of current attack methods makes them easily detectable by a verifier; namely that they cannot produce sufficiently identical gradients. Theoretically, we analyse the question of whether two distinct mini-batches can produce the same gradient. Generally, we find that while there may exist an infinite number of distinct mini-batches with real-valued training examples and labels that produce the same gradient, finding those that are within the allowed domain e.g. pixel values between 0-255 and one hot labels is a non trivial task. Our results call for the reevaluation of the strength of existing attacks, and for additional research into successful data forging, given the serious consequences it may have on machine learning and privacy.</description>

      <title>A Survey of AI-Related Cyber Security Risks and Countermeasures in Mobility-as-a-Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) integrates different transport modalities and can support more personalisation of travellers' journey planning based on their individual preferences, behaviours and wishes. To fully achieve the potential of MaaS, a range of AI (including machine learning and data mining) algorithms are needed to learn personal requirements and needs, to optimise journey planning of each traveller and all travellers as a whole, to help transport service operators and relevant governmental bodies to operate and plan their services, and to detect and prevent cyber attacks from various threat actors including dishonest and malicious travellers and transport operators. The increasing use of different AI and data processing algorithms in both centralised and distributed settings opens the MaaS ecosystem up to diverse cyber and privacy attacks at both the AI algorithm level and the connectivity surfaces. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review on the coupling between AI-driven MaaS design and the diverse cyber security challenges related to cyber attacks and countermeasures. In particular, we focus on how current and emerging AI-facilitated privacy risks (profiling, inference, and third-party threats) and adversarial AI attacks (evasion, extraction, and gamification) may impact the MaaS ecosystem. These risks often combine novel attacks (e.g., inverse learning) with traditional attack vectors (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), exacerbating the risks for the wider participation actors and the emergence of new business models.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Language Models through Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for watermarking language models through prompts generated by language models. The proposed approach utilizes a multi-model setup, incorporating a Prompting language model to generate watermarking instructions, a Marking language model to embed watermarks within generated content, and a Detecting language model to verify the presence of these watermarks. Experiments are conducted using ChatGPT and Mistral as the Prompting and Marking language models, with detection accuracy evaluated using a pretrained classifier model. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy across various configurations, with 95% accuracy for ChatGPT, 88.79% for Mistral. These findings validate the and adaptability of the proposed watermarking strategy across different language model architectures. Hence the proposed framework holds promise for applications in content attribution, copyright protection, and model authentication.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in genomics technology lead to a rising volume of viral (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) sequence data, resulting in increased usage of machine learning (ML) in bioinformatics. Traditional ML techniques require centralized data collection and processing, posing challenges in realistic healthcare scenarios. Additionally, privacy, ownership, and stringent regulation issues exist when pooling medical data into centralized storage to train a powerful deep learning (DL) model. The Federated learning (FL) approach overcomes such issues by setting up a central aggregator server and a shared global model. It also facilitates data privacy by extracting knowledge while keeping the actual data private. This work proposes a cutting-edge Privacy enhancement through Iterative Collaboration (EPIC) architecture. The network is divided and distributed between local and centralized servers. We demonstrate the EPIC approach to resolve a supervised classification problem to estimate SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data lineage without explicitly transferring raw sequence data. We aim to create a universal decentralized optimization framework that allows various data holders to work together and converge to a single predictive model. The findings demonstrate that privacy-preserving strategies can be successfully used with aggregation approaches without materially altering the degree of learning convergence. Finally, we highlight a few potential issues and prospects for study in FL-based approaches to healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>How to Delete Without a Trace: Certified Deniability in a Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to comprehensively destroy a piece of quantum information, so that nothing is left behind except the memory of whether one had it at one point? For example, various works, most recently Morimae, Poremba, and Yamakawa (TQC 2024), show how to construct a signature scheme with certified deletion where a user who deletes a signature on m cannot later produce a signature for m. However, in all of the existing schemes, even after deletion the user is still able keep irrefutable evidence that m was signed, and thus they do not fully capture the spirit of deletion.
  In this work, we initiate the study of certified deniability in order to obtain a more comprehensive notion of deletion. Certified deniability uses a simulation-based security definition, ensuring that any information the user has kept after deletion could have been learned without being given the deleteable object to begin with; meaning that deletion leaves no trace behind! We define and construct two non-interactive primitives that satisfy certified deniability in the quantum random oracle model: signatures and non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (NIZKs). As a consequence, for example, it is not possible to delete a signature/NIZK and later provide convincing evidence that it used to exist. Notably, our results utilize uniquely quantum phenomena to bypass the celebrated result of Pass (CRYPTO, 2003) showing that deniable NIZKs are impossible even in the random oracle model.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of In-Context Learning in Transformers for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities across various domains, including statistical learning tasks. While previous work has shown that transformers can implement common learning algorithms, the adversarial robustness of these learned algorithms remains unexplored. This work investigates the vulnerability of in-context learning in transformers to \textit{hijacking attacks} focusing on the setting of linear regression tasks. Hijacking attacks are prompt-manipulation attacks in which the adversary's goal is to manipulate the prompt to force the transformer to generate a specific output. We first prove that single-layer linear transformers, known to implement gradient descent in-context, are non-robust and can be manipulated to output arbitrary predictions by perturbing a single example in the in-context training set. While our experiments show these attacks succeed on linear transformers, we find they do not transfer to more complex transformers with GPT-2 architectures. Nonetheless, we show that these transformers can be hijacked using gradient-based adversarial attacks. We then demonstrate that adversarial training enhances transformers' robustness against hijacking attacks, even when just applied during finetuning. Additionally, we find that in some settings, adversarial training against a weaker attack model can lead to robustness to a stronger attack model. Lastly, we investigate the transferability of hijacking attacks across transformers of varying scales and initialization seeds, as well as between transformers and ordinary least squares (OLS). We find that while attacks transfer effectively between small-scale transformers, they show poor transferability in other scenarios (small-to-large scale, large-to-large scale, and between transformers and OLS).</description>

      <title>Private Algorithms for Stochastic Saddle Points and Variational Inequalities: Beyond Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic study of stochastic saddle point problems (SSP) and stochastic variational inequalities (SVI) under the constraint of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean setups. We first consider Lipschitz convex-concave SSPs in the $\ell_p/\ell_q$ setup, $p,q\in[1,2]$. Here, we obtain a bound of $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon}\big)$ on the strong SP-gap, where $n$ is the number of samples and $d$ is the dimension. This rate is nearly optimal for any $p,q\in[1,2]$. Without additional assumptions, such as smoothness or linearity requirements, prior work under DP has only obtained this rate when $p=q=2$ (i.e., only in the Euclidean setup). Further, existing algorithms have each only been shown to work for specific settings of $p$ and $q$ and under certain assumptions on the loss and the feasible set, whereas we provide a general algorithm for DP SSPs whenever $p,q\in[1,2]$. Our result is obtained via a novel analysis of the recursive regularization algorithm. In particular, we develop new tools for analyzing generalization, which may be of independent interest. Next, we turn our attention towards SVIs with a monotone, bounded and Lipschitz operator and consider $\ell_p$-setups, $p\in[1,2]$. Here, we provide the first analysis which obtains a bound on the strong VI-gap of $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon}\big)$. For $p-1=\Omega(1)$, this rate is near optimal due to existing lower bounds. To obtain this result, we develop a modified version of recursive regularization. Our analysis builds on the techniques we develop for SSPs as well as employing additional novel components which handle difficulties arising from adapting the recursive regularization framework to SVIs.</description>

      <title>Traceable random numbers from a nonlocal quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security and applications that fairly distribute resources. However, existing random number generators have limitations-the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited, and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol is at the heart of a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7434 out of 7454 attempts -- a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error times actual success probability bounded by $2^{-64}$. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents one of the first public services that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches.</description>

      <title>A Quality-Centric Framework for Generic Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the generalization issue in deepfake detection by harnessing forgery quality in training data. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. The framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied in a plug-and-play manner and significantly enhance the generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Under Class Imbalance: Methods and Empirical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced learning occurs in classification settings where the distribution of class-labels is highly skewed in the training data, such as when predicting rare diseases or in fraud detection. This class imbalance presents a significant algorithmic challenge, which can be further exacerbated when privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy are applied to protect sensitive training data. Our work formalizes these challenges and provides a number of algorithmic solutions. We consider DP variants of pre-processing methods that privately augment the original dataset to reduce the class imbalance; these include oversampling, SMOTE, and private synthetic data generation. We also consider DP variants of in-processing techniques, which adjust the learning algorithm to account for the imbalance; these include model bagging, class-weighted empirical risk minimization and class-weighted deep learning. For each method, we either adapt an existing imbalanced learning technique to the private setting or demonstrate its incompatibility with differential privacy. Finally, we empirically evaluate these privacy-preserving imbalanced learning methods under various data and distributional settings. We find that private synthetic data methods perform well as a data pre-processing step, while class-weighted ERMs are an alternative in higher-dimensional settings where private synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Free Record-Level Privacy Risk Evaluation Through Artifact-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to empirically assess the privacy risks of samples used to train a target machine learning model. State-of-the-art methods however require training hundreds of shadow models, with the same size and architecture of the target model, solely to evaluate the privacy risk. While one might be able to afford this for small models, the cost often becomes prohibitive for medium and large models.
  We here instead propose a novel approach to identify the at-risk samples using only artifacts available during training, with little to no additional computational overhead. Our method analyzes individual per-sample loss traces and uses them to identify the vulnerable data samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact-based approach through experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset, showing high precision in identifying vulnerable samples as determined by a SOTA shadow model-based MIA (LiRA). Impressively, our method reaches the same precision as another SOTA MIA when measured against LiRA, despite it being orders of magnitude cheaper. We then show LT-IQR to outperform alternative loss aggregation methods, perform ablation studies on hyperparameters, and validate the robustness of our method to the target metric. Finally, we study the evolution of the vulnerability score distribution throughout training as a metric for model-level risk assessment.</description>

      <title>On Differentially Private String Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a database of bit strings $A_1,\ldots,A_m\in \{0,1\}^n$, a fundamental data structure task is to estimate the distances between a given query $B\in \{0,1\}^n$ with all the strings in the database. In addition, one might further want to ensure the integrity of the database by releasing these distance statistics in a secure manner. In this work, we propose differentially private (DP) data structures for this type of tasks, with a focus on Hamming and edit distance. On top of the strong privacy guarantees, our data structures are also time- and space-efficient. In particular, our data structure is $\epsilon$-DP against any sequence of queries of arbitrary length, and for any query $B$ such that the maximum distance to any string in the database is at most $k$, we output $m$ distance estimates. Moreover,
  - For Hamming distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/\log k})$;
  - For edit distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk^2+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/(\log k \log n)})$.
  For moderate $k$, both data structures support sublinear query operations. We obtain these results via a novel adaptation of the randomized response technique as a bit flipping procedure, applied to the sketched strings.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mobile App Reviews to Guide Misuse Audits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem: We address the challenge in responsible computing where an exploitable mobile app is misused by one app user (an abuser) against another user or bystander (victim). We introduce the idea of a misuse audit of apps as a way of determining if they are exploitable without access to their implementation.
  Method: We leverage app reviews to identify exploitable apps and their functionalities that enable misuse. First, we build a computational model to identify alarming reviews (which report misuse). Second, using the model, we identify exploitable apps and their functionalities. Third, we validate them through manual inspection of reviews.
  Findings: Stories by abusers and victims mostly focus on past misuses, whereas stories by third parties mostly identify stories indicating the potential for misuse. Surprisingly, positive reviews by abusers, which exhibit language with high dominance, also reveal misuses. In total, we confirmed 156 exploitable apps facilitating the misuse. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found exploitable apps exhibiting four types of exploitable functionalities.
  Implications: Our method can help identify exploitable apps and their functionalities, facilitating misuse audits of a large pool of apps.</description>

      <title>You Can't Trust Your Tag Neither: Privacy Leaks and Potential Legal Violations within the Google Tag Manager</title>

Abstract: Tag Management Systems were developed in order to support website publishers in installing multiple third-party JavaScript scripts (Tags) on their websites. Google developed its own TMS called ``Google Tag Manager'' (GTM) that is currently present on 42\% of the top 1 million most popular websites. However, GTM has not yet been thoroughly evaluated by the academic research community. In this work, we study, for the first time, the Tags provided within the GTM system. We propose a new methodology called ``detecting privacy leaks in isolation'' and apply it to multiple Tags to analyse the types of data that Tags collect and contrast them to the legal and technical documentation, in collaboration with a legal expert. Across three studies - in-depth analysis of 6 Tags, automated analysis of 718 Tags, and analysis of Google ``Consent Mode'' - we discover multiple hidden data leaks, incomplete and diverging declarations, undisclosed third-parties and cookies, personal data sharing without consent and we further identify potential legal violations within EU Data Protection law.</description>

      <title>Security Attacks Abusing Pulse-level Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first thorough exploration of the attacks on the interface between gate-level and pulse-level quantum circuits and pulse-level quantum circuits themselves. Typically, quantum circuits and programs that execute on quantum computers, are defined using gate-level primitives. However, to improve the expressivity of quantum circuits and to allow better optimization, pulse-level circuits are now often used. The attacks presented in this work leverage the inconsistency between the gate-level description of the custom gate, and the actual, low-level pulse implementation of this gate. By manipulating the custom gate specification, this work proposes numerous attacks: qubit plunder, qubit block, qubit reorder, timing mismatch, frequency mismatch, phase mismatch, and waveform mismatch. This work demonstrates these attacks on the real quantum computer and simulator, and shows that most current software development kits are vulnerable to these new types of attacks. In the end, this work proposes a defense framework. The exploration of security and privacy issues of the rising pulse-level quantum circuits provides insight into the future development of secure quantum software development kits and quantum computer systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Algorithms for Graph Cuts: A Shifting Mechanism Approach and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the multiway cut and the minimum $k$-cut. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems. Motivated by multiway cut, we propose the shifting mechanism, a general framework for private combinatorial optimization problems. This framework allows us to develop an efficient private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm, improving over previous private algorithms that have provably worse multiplicative loss. We then provide a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that for constant $k$, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the privacy cost. The shifting mechanism also allows us to design private algorithm for the multicut and max-cut problems, with runtimes determined by the best non-private algorithms for these tasks. For the minimum $k$-cut problem we use a different approach, combining the exponential mechanism with bounds on the number of approximate $k$-cuts to get the first private algorithm with optimal additive error of $O(k\log n)$ (for a fixed privacy parameter). We also establish an information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Furthermore, we provide an efficient private algorithm even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\tilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Fuzzy Name Matching for Sharing Financial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial institutions rely on data for many operations, including a need to drive efficiency, enhance services and prevent financial crime. Data sharing across an organisation or between institutions can facilitate rapid, evidence-based decision-making, including identifying money laundering and fraud. However, modern data privacy regulations impose restrictions on data sharing. For this reason, privacy-enhancing technologies are being increasingly employed to allow organisations to derive shared intelligence while ensuring regulatory compliance.
  This paper examines the case in which regulatory restrictions mean a party cannot share data on accounts of interest with another (internal or external) party to determine individuals that hold accounts in both datasets. The names of account holders may be recorded differently in each dataset. We introduce a novel privacy-preserving scheme for fuzzy name matching across institutions, employing fully homomorphic encryption over MinHash signatures. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is enhanced using a clustering mechanism. Our scheme ensures privacy by only revealing the possibility of a potential match to the querying party. The practicality and effectiveness are evaluated using different datasets, and compared against state-of-the-art schemes. It takes around 100 and 1000 seconds to search 1000 names from 10k and 100k names, respectively, meeting the requirements of financial institutions. Furthermore, it exhibits significant performance improvement in reducing communication overhead by 30-300 times.</description>

      <title>Embedding with Large Language Models for Classification of HIPAA Safeguard Compliance Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although software developers of mHealth apps are responsible for protecting patient data and adhering to strict privacy and security requirements, many of them lack awareness of HIPAA regulations and struggle to distinguish between HIPAA rules categories. Therefore, providing guidance of HIPAA rules patterns classification is essential for developing secured applications for Google Play Store. In this work, we identified the limitations of traditional Word2Vec embeddings in processing code patterns. To address this, we adopt multilingual BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which offers contextualized embeddings to the attributes of dataset to overcome the issues. Therefore, we applied this BERT to our dataset for embedding code patterns and then uses these embedded code to various machine learning approaches. Our results demonstrate that the models significantly enhances classification performance, with Logistic Regression achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.95\%. Additionally, we obtained high accuracy from Support Vector Machine (99.79\%), Random Forest (99.73\%), and Naive Bayes (95.93\%), outperforming existing approaches. This work underscores the effectiveness and showcases its potential for secure application development.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security.
  In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</description>

      <title>Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed to craft adversarial clothes for evading person detectors, while they are either only effective at limited viewing angles or very conspicuous to humans. We aim to craft adversarial texture for clothes based on 3D modeling, an idea that has been used to craft rigid adversarial objects such as a 3D-printed turtle. Unlike rigid objects, humans and clothes are non-rigid, leading to difficulties in physical realization. In order to craft natural-looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors at multiple viewing angles, we propose adversarial camouflage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble one kind of the typical textures of daily clothes, camouflage textures. We leverage the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to parameterize the camouflage textures and optimize the parameters via 3D modeling. Moreover, we propose an efficient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) to narrow the gap between digital and real-world objects. We printed the developed 3D texture pieces on fabric materials and tailored them into T-shirts and trousers. Experiments show high attack success rates of these clothes against multiple detectors.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Multi-Tier Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11592v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model parameters. In this work, we propose Multi-Tier Federated Learning with Multi-Tier Differential Privacy (M^2FDP), a DP-enhanced FL methodology for jointly optimizing privacy and performance in hierarchical networks. One of the key concepts of M^2FDP is to extend the concept of HDP towards Multi-Tier Differential Privacy (MDP), while also adapting DP noise injection at different layers of an established FL hierarchy -- edge devices, edge servers, and cloud servers -- according to the trust models within particular subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior of M^2FDP, revealing conditions on parameter tuning under which the training process converges sublinearly to a finite stationarity gap that depends on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target privacy level.
  Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that M^2FDP obtains substantial improvements in these metrics over baselines for different privacy budgets, and validate the impact of different system configurations.</description>

      <title>Secret Collusion among Generative AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.</description>

      <title>Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers often hide the architectural details and parameters of their proprietary models by restricting public access to a limited API. In this work we show that, with only a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1000 USD for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.</description>

      <title>BAN: Detecting Backdoors Activated by Adversarial Neuron Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on deep learning represent a recent threat that has gained significant attention in the research community. Backdoor defenses are mainly based on backdoor inversion, which has been shown to be generic, model-agnostic, and applicable to practical threat scenarios. State-of-the-art backdoor inversion recovers a mask in the feature space to locate prominent backdoor features, where benign and backdoor features can be disentangled. However, it suffers from high computational overhead, and we also find that it overly relies on prominent backdoor features that are highly distinguishable from benign features. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper improves backdoor feature inversion for backdoor detection by incorporating extra neuron activation information. In particular, we adversarially increase the loss of backdoored models with respect to weights to activate the backdoor effect, based on which we can easily differentiate backdoored and clean models. Experimental results demonstrate our defense, BAN, is 1.37$\times$ (on CIFAR-10) and 5.11$\times$ (on ImageNet200) more efficient with an average 9.99\% higher detect success rate than the state-of-the-art defense BTI-DBF. Our code and trained models are publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/xiaoyunxxy/ban}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detoxifying multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their increasing global use. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8% to 3.9% across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO. Finally, we show that bilingual sentence retrieval can predict the cross-lingual transferability of DPO preference tuning.</description>

      <title>Attack-Aware Noise Calibration for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale to satisfy a given privacy budget $\varepsilon$. This privacy budget is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risks, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of inference attacks aimed to recover information about the training data records. We show that first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget $\varepsilon$, and then translating {\epsilon} to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. Instead, we propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the step of choosing $\varepsilon$. For a given notion of attack risk, our approach significantly decreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than $\varepsilon$, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy.

      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on $n$ bits that are induced from Boolean functions on $k$ bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider such functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective, and their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its induced functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its induced functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>Soft-Label Integration for Robust Toxicity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14894</link>

Abstract: Toxicity classification in textual content remains a significant problem. Data with labels from a single annotator fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives. Therefore, there is a growing need to incorporate crowdsourced annotations for training an effective toxicity classifier. Additionally, the standard approach to training a classifier using empirical risk minimization (ERM) may fail to address the potential shifts between the training set and testing set due to exploiting spurious correlations. This work introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework that integrates crowdsourced annotations with the soft-labeling technique and optimizes the soft-label weights by Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) risk. We theoretically prove the convergence of our bi-level optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in leveraging crowdsourced annotations to achieve more effective and robust toxicity classification.</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid PQC-QKD protocols with enhanced security and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>

      <title>Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Towards Secured Smart Grid 2.0: Exploring Security Threats, Protection Models, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Continual Learning using Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the intersection of continual learning (CL) and differential privacy (DP). Crucially, continual learning models must retain knowledge across tasks, but this conflicts with the differential privacy requirement of restricting individual samples to be memorised in the model. We propose using pre-trained models to address the trade-offs between privacy and performance in a continual learning setting. More specifically, we present necessary assumptions to enable privacy-preservation and propose combining pre-trained models with parameter-free classifiers and parameter-efficient adapters that are learned under differential privacy. Our experiments demonstrate their effectiveness and provide insights into balancing the competing demands of continual learning and privacy.</description>
