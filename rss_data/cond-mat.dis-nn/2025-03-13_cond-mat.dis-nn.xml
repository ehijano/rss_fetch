      <title>The benefit of ignorance for traffic through a random congestible network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When traffic is routed through a network that is susceptible to congestion, the self-interested decisions made by individual users do not, in general, produce the optimal flow. This discrepancy is quantified by the so-called "price of anarchy." Here we consider whether the traffic produced by self-interested users is made better or worse when users have uncertain knowledge about the cost functions of the links in the network, and we define a parallel concept that we call the "price of ignorance." We introduce a simple model in which fast, congestible links and slow, incongestible links are mixed randomly in a large network and users plan their routes with finite uncertainty about which of the two cost functions describes each link. One of our key findings is that a small level of user ignorance universally improves traffic, regardless of the network composition. Further, there is an optimal level of ignorance which, in our model, causes the self-interested user behavior to coincide with the optimum. Many features of our model can be understood analytically, including the optimal level of user ignorance and the existence of critical scaling near the percolation threshold for fast links, where the potential benefit of user ignorance is greatest.</description>

      <title>A New Circle Theorem for Two Dimensional Ising Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lee-Yang circle theorem revolutionized our understanding of phase transitions in ferromagnetic systems by showing that the complex zeros of partition functions lie on the unit circle, with criticality arising as these zeros approach the real axis in the thermodynamic limit. However, in frustrated systems such as antiferromagnets and spin glasses, the zeros deviate from this structure, making it challenging to extend the Lee-Yang theory to disordered systems. In this work, we establish a new circle theorem for two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, proving that the square of the partition function exhibits zeros densely packed along the unit circle. Numerical simulations on the square lattice confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the circle law for quenched disorder. Furthermore, our results uncover a finite-temperature crossover in $\pm J$ spin glasses, characterized by the emergence of a spectral gap in the angular distribution of zeros. This result extends the Lee-Yang framework to disordered systems, offering new insights into spin-glass criticality.</description>

      <title>Convolutional transformer wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural quantum states have recently achieved remarkable performance in solving challenging quantum many-body problems. While transformer networks appear particularly promising due to their success in computer science, we show that previously reported transformer wave functions haven't so far been capable to utilize their full power. Here, we introduce the convolutional transformer wave function (CTWF). We show that our CTWFs exhibit superior performance in ground-state search and non-equilibrium dynamics compared to previous results, demonstrating promising capacity in complex quantum problems.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory: a real-space quantum embedding approach to disorder in strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum embedding algorithm in real-space for the simultaneous theoretical treatment of nonlocal electronic correlations and disorder, the coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory (C-CDMFT). This algorithm combines the molecular coherent potential approximation with the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. After a pedagogical introduction to quantum embedding theories for disordered and interacting electron systems, and a detailed discussion of its work flow, we present first results from C-CDMFT for the half-filled two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model on a square lattice: (i) the analysis of its Mott metal-insulator transition as a function of disorder strength, and (ii) the impact of different types of disorder on its magnetic phase diagram. For the latter, by means of a "disorder diagnostics", we are able to precisely identify the contributions of different disorder configurations to the system's magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M): How to Find Flat Minima in Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

      <title>Phenomenological model of crack patterns in thin colloidal films undergoing desiccation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.</description>

      <title>Picosecond transfer from short-term to long-term memory in analog antiferromagnetic memory device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous experiments in compensated magnets have demonstrated a potential for approaching the limit of fastest and least-dissipative operation of digital memory bits. However, the analog route has been virtually unexplored at (sub)ps time scales. In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices made from a metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device's variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s. The potentially appealing features of the heat-based memory for several distinct research fields, including bio-inspired analogue devices and heat-based logic, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>Quantum combinatorial optimization beyond the variational paradigm: simple schedules for hard problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Maximum 2-Satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>
