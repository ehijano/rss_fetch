      <title>Effective Field Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists have been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of dimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the underlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the machine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose a new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks (EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body interactions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical $3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case studies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model. Furthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a small system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional training and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the efficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Design of resilient structures by randomization and bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines various ways of improving the impact resilience of protective structures. Such structures' purpose is to dissipate an impact's energy while avoiding cracking and failure. We have tested the reaction of plane elastic-brittle lattices to an impulse. Four topologies are compared: periodic triangular, square, and hexagonal topologies, and aperiodic Penrose topology. Then, structures with random variations of the links' stiffness, node positions, and random holes are compared. Combinations of these random factors are also considered, as well as the resilience of bistable elastic-brittle lattices with sacrificial links. Several parameters are introduced to measure the structural resilience of the compared designs: (i) the amount of dissipated impact energy, (ii) the size of broken clusters of links, and (iii) the spread of damage. The results suggest new routes for rationally designing protective structures using nonperiodic topology, bistability, and structural randomness. In particular, we find that some quantities of interest can be maximized by tuning the randomized design appropriately -- for example, randomly removing 8\% of links maximizes energy dissipation. We also find that randomization of bistable lattices can offer superior energy dissipation while reducing the connectivity between broken clusters of links.</description>

      <title>Learning atomic forces from uncertainty-calibrated adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial approaches, which intentionally challenge machine learning models by generating difficult examples, are increasingly being adopted to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided hierarchical neural networks for Maxwell's equations in plasmonic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) has found multiple applications in photonics, traditional "black box" ML models typically require prohibitively large training datasets. Generation of such data, as well as the training processes themselves, consume significant resources, often limiting practical applications of ML. Here we demonstrate that embedding Maxwell's equations into ML design and training significantly reduces the required amount of data and improves the physics-consistency and generalizability of ML models, opening the road to practical ML tools that do not need extremely large training sets. The proposed physics-guided machine learning (PGML) is illustrated on the example of predicting complex field distributions within hyperbolic metamaterial-based photonic funnels. The hierarchical network design used in the study points to the emergence of effective medium theories within neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fully Compressible Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Solar Convection Zones with CHORUS++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic solver for fast simulations of the global dynamo of the Sun using unstructured grids and GPUs. Accurate modeling of the Sun's convective layers is vital to predicting the Sun's behavior, including the solar dynamo and sunspot cycles. Currently, there are many efficient codes capable of conducting these large simulations; however, many assume an anealastic density distribution. The anelastic assumption is capable of producing accurate results for low mach numbers; however, it fails in regions with a higher mach number and a fully compressible flow must be considered. To avoid these issues, Wang et al. [1] created a Compressible High-ORder Unstructured Spectral difference (CHORUS) code for simulating fluid dynamics inside stars and planets. CHORUS++ augmented the CHORUS code to adopt a higher degree of polynomials by using cubed-sphere meshing and transfinite mapping to perform simulations on unstructured grids [2]. Recently, CHORUS++ was further developed for parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions on GPUs at Clarkson University. In this study the solar benchmark problems presented by Chen et al. [2] are extended to unsteady solar dynamo problems, with two different density scale heights. The CHORUS-MHD code is further accelerated by multiple GPUs and used to successfully solve these solar dynamo benchmark problems.

      <title>ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms.
  Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level.
  All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

      <title>Controlling dynamics of stochastic systems with deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A properly designed controller can help improve the quality of experimental measurements or force a dynamical system to follow a completely new time-evolution path. Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have made steep advances toward designing effective control schemes for fairly complex systems. However, a general simulation scheme that employs deep reinforcement learning for exerting control in stochastic systems is yet to be established. In this paper, we attempt to further bridge a gap between control theory and deep reinforcement learning by proposing a simulation algorithm that allows achieving control of the dynamics of stochastic systems through the use of trained artificial neural networks. Specifically, we use agent-based simulations where the neural network plays the role of the controller that drives local state-to-state transitions. We demonstrate the workflow and the effectiveness of the proposed control methods by considering the following two stochastic processes: particle coalescence on a lattice and a totally asymmetric exclusion process.</description>

      <title>No-slip, slip and friction at fluid-solid interfaces: Concept of adsorption layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a fluid contacts solid surfaces, it can spread or slide, and the motion of the contact line involves a complex interplay between hydrodynamic and thermodynamic effects. Hydrodynamic theories, like the Huh &amp; Scriven and Cox &amp; Voinov models, assumeno-slip boundary condition, neglecting the macroscopic fluid slip at the fluid-solid interface. However, they cannot explain the contact line motion during droplet spreading whichthermodynamic theories is attribute to the microscopic surface diffusion of fluid molecules. To bridge these perspectives, we heed the physical origin of slip phenomenon by employing energy minimization principles to establish a force balance between solid-fluid friction, thermodynamic force, and viscous stress at the fluid-solid contact region. Our analysis reveals that slip is an intrinsic property, just like molecular surface diffusion, is also governedfluid-solid intermolecular interactions. Based on our model with slip, we extend the classical Huh &amp; Scriven and Cox &amp; Voinov theories by incorporating friction, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of droplet slide and kinetic induced contact angle hysteresis (CAH). Our results demonstrate that solid-fluid friction plays a vital role in momentum transfer between the substrate and the droplet, therefore, modifies the droplet internal fluid flow during wetting drastically. Under strong friction, classical wetting predictions with CAH are recovered, whereas weak friction suppresses internal fluid motion, leadingthe disappearance of CAH. These findings provide new insights into wetting dynamics, highlighting the importance of friction in slip behavior. This work has broad implications for droplet transport, surface engineering, and applications in microfluidics and coatings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation by the tensor neural network. Based on the tensor product structure, we can do the direct numerical integration by using fixed quadrature points for the functions constructed by the tensor neural network within tolerable computational complexity. Especially, we design several types of efficient numerical methods to treat the variable-coupled Coulomb potentials with high accuracy. The corresponding machine learning method is built for solving many-body Schrodinger equation. Some numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>GPU-Native Adaptive Mesh Refinement with Application to Lattice Boltzmann Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) enables efficient computation of flows by providing high resolution in critical regions while allowing for coarsening in areas where fine detail is unnecessary. While early AMR software packages relied solely on CPU parallelization, the widespread adoption of heterogeneous computing systems has led to GPU-accelerated implementations. In these hybrid approaches, simulation data typically resides on the GPU, and mesh management and adaptation occur exclusively on the CPU, necessitating frequent data transfers between them. A more efficient strategy is to adapt and maintain the entire mesh structure exclusively on the GPU, eliminating these transfers. Because of its inherent parallelism, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has been widely implemented in hybrid AMR frameworks. This work presents a GPU-native algorithm for AMR using a block-based forest of octrees approach, implemented in both two and three dimensions as open-source C++/CUDA code. The implementation includes a Lattice Boltzmann solver for weakly compressible flow, though the underlying grid refinement procedure is compatible with any solver operating on cell-centered block-based grids. The lid-driven cavity and flow past a square cylinder benchmarks validate the algorithm's effectiveness across multiple velocity sets in both single- and double-precision. Tests conducted on consumer and datacenter-grade GPUs demonstrate its versatility across different hardware platforms.

      <title>Adaptive Quasicontinuum Methods and Simulations for Crystal Defects with a Theory based Unified a Posteriori Error Estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive quasicontinuum (QC) methods are important methodologies in molecular mechanics for the simulations of materials with defects, intending to achieve the optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency on the fly. In this study, we propose a residual-force based a posteriori error estimate that is simple and is unified for consistent quasicontinuum methods, as opposed to the widely adopted residual-stress based a posteriori error estimates which are complicated and need to be derived for the particular QC method under consideration. The simple and unified formulation of the estimator, together with certain sampling techniques, leads to a highly efficient and adaptable implementation. We also prove in theory that the unified error estimator provides an upper bound of the true error. We develop adaptive algorithms based on this unified estimator and validate the algorithms by several representative quasicontinuum methods for various types of crystalline defects, in terms of convergence and efficiency. In particular, the adaptive simulations of the anti-plane crack, of which we possess little a priori knowledge, demonstrate the necessity and significance of the proposed a posteriori estimates and the adaptive strategies.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. The stability improvements cannot be matched by reducing the simulation timestep; thus, StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASK-Berkeley/StABlE-Training.</description>

Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when a field dresses the remaining ion. Its manifestation is due to entanglement between a free electron and a hybrid state of light and matter. Direct detection of such entanglement is however not possible by coincidence schemes due to the dressing mechanism having an inconspicuous phase correlation effect on the ion. Here, it is shown that odd envelopes fundamentally alter the entanglement, such that channel-resolved photoelectron distributions become identifiable in coincidence with the internal state of the field-free ion. This constitutes a first usage of the parity of time symmetry in strong-field interactions.</description>

      <title>General theory for packing icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>

Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>High-order limiting methods using maximum principle bounds derived from the Boltzmann equation I: Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of limiting methods for high-order numerical approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws generally requires defining an admissible region/bounds for the solution. In this work, we present a novel approach for computing solution bounds and limiting for the Euler equations through the kinetic representation provided by the Boltzmann equation, which allows for extending limiters designed for linear advection directly to the Euler equations. Given an arbitrary set of solution values to compute bounds over (e.g., numerical stencil) and a desired linear advection limiter, the proposed approach yields an analytic expression for the admissible region of particle distribution function values, which may be numerically integrated to yield a set of bounds for the density, momentum, and total energy. These solution bounds are shown to preserve positivity of density/pressure/internal energy and, when paired with a limiting technique, can robustly resolve strong discontinuities while recovering high-order accuracy in smooth regions without any ad hoc corrections (e.g., relaxing the bounds). This approach is demonstrated in the context of an explicit unstructured high-order discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction scheme for a variety of difficult problems in gas dynamics, including cases with extreme shocks and shock-vortex interactions. Furthermore, this work presents a foundation for limiting techniques for more complex macroscopic governing equations that can be derived from an underlying kinetic representation for which admissible solution bounds are not well-understood.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Ground State Preparation via Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a recurrent neural network-based approach for ground state preparation utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback. Unlike previous methods that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>Transferability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates: A pathway towards intrinsic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing molecular vibrational energies and wavefunctions using variational approaches is a computationally demanding task, with the primary bottleneck being the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The achievable accuracy depends on the dimensionality and complexity of the vibrational problem, the number and quality of the utilized basis functions and on the choice of vibrational coordinates. Composing basis sets with normalizing flows is a newly emerged idea to improve their expressivity and subsequently reduce the computational effort of variational methods. This approach generates coordinates tailored to a given vibrational problem for a selected truncated basis. We illustrate that the optimized coordinates results in more accurate predictions and faster convergence when transferred across different basis-set truncations, without the need for re-optimization. In addition, we show that the optimized coordinates are transferable across isotopologues and across molecules with similar structural motifs.</description>
