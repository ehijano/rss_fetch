      <title>Board gender diversity and emissions performance: Insights from panel regressions, machine learning, and explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With European Union initiatives mandating gender quotas on corporate boards, a key question arises: Is greater board gender diversity (BGD) associated with better emissions performance (EP)? To answer this question, we examine the influence of BGD on EP across a sample of European firms from 2016 to 2022. Using panel regressions, advanced machine learning algorithms, and explainable AI, we reveal a non-linear relationship. Specifically, EP improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 %, beyond which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in EP. A minimum BGD threshold of 22 % is necessary for meaningful improvements in EP. To assess the legitimacy of EP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG controversies weaken the BGD-EP relationship. The results show no significant effect, suggesting that BGD's impact is driven by governance mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, path analysis indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to EP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes EP. The results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrency as an Investable Asset Class: Coming of Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We organize existing empirical regularities of cryptocurrencies into seven stylized facts and analyze cryptocurrencies through the lens of empirical asset pricing. We find important similarities with traditional markets--risk-adjusted performance so far is broadly comparable, and the cross-section of returns can be summarized by a small set of factors. However, cryptocurrency also has its own distinct character: jumps are frequent and large, and blockchain information helps drive prices. This common set of stylized facts provides evidence that cryptocurrency is emerging as an investable asset class. Additionally, we discuss potential data quality issues and possible changes in future regulations and the cryptocurrency environment.</description>
