      <title>Josephson effect and critical currents in trivial and topological full-shell hybrid nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\pi$- and $\phi_0$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.</description>

      <title>Fusion Dynamics of Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Nematicity, Multiferroicity, and Nonlinear Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic nematicity-the spontaneous reduction of rotational symmetry-has been widely studied in strongly correlated quantum materials, yet its interplay with other symmetry-breaking phases remains an outstanding experimental challenge to unravel, particularly in van der Waals heterostructures. Here, using angle-resolved transport measurements, we reveal a unique intertwinement of nematicity, orbital multiferroicity, and the nonlinear Hall effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. This coupling enables electric-field-driven switching of the nematic principal axis and the nonlinear Hall polar vector, coinciding with the butterfly-shaped hysteresis of the multiferroic order. We identify two sharply defined nematic phase transitions: the first coincides with the onset of orbital ferromagnetism, while the second, at lower temperatures, aligns with the emergence of ferroelectricity. Our findings point to a nematic-driven instability that intertwines rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetry breaking. This is consistent with spontaneous momentum polarization, proposed to occur under the influence of the Coulomb-driven flocking effect. Together, our observations establish nematicity as a fundamental organizing principle in the landscape of intertwined electronic orders in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses in insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new classes of gapped topological phases characterized by quantized crystalline-electromagnetic responses, termed "multipolar Chern insulators". These systems are characterized by nonsymmorphic momentum-space symmetries and mirror symmetries, leading to quantization of momentum-weighted Berry curvature multipole moments. We construct lattice models for such phases and confirm their quantized responses through numerical calculations. These systems exhibit bound charge and momentum densities at lattice and magnetic defects, and currents induced by electric or time-varying strain fields. Our work extends the classification of topological matter by uncovering novel symmetry-protected topological phases with quantized responses.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for non-Hermitian approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work paves the way for a rigorous understanding of non-Hermitian physics in quantum systems and their experimental verification through complex frequency-domain techniques.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking during Low-Temperature Domain Formation in Micron-sized Magnetite Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of synchrotron Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) experiments to investigate domain formation in a micron-sized magnetite crystal undergoing the Verwey transition at low temperature. A strong splitting of the measured 311 Bragg reflection was observed in the low-temperature phase, indicating the formation of domains. BCDI revealed pronounced strain distributions, characterized by a clear layered stripe domain structure in real-space. Stripes were seen only along the [001] crystallographic direction, normal to the substrate surface direction, breaking the symmetry of the cubic high-temperature phase. It is argued that other domain directions were suppressed by the sample mounting orientation. More surprisingly, only a single domain orientation was observed, suggesting an additional symmetry-breaking influence originating from the shape of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking low-power flopping-mode spin qubit fidelities in Si/SiGe devices with alloy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the "flopping-mode" regime of electron spin resonance, a single electron confined in a double quantum dot is electrically driven in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. The increased dipole moment of the charge in the flopping mode significantly reduces the amount of power required to drive spin rotations. However, the susceptibility of flopping-mode spin qubits to charge noise, and consequently their overall performance, has not been examined in detail. In this work, we simulate single-qubit gate fidelities of electrically driven spin rotations in an ensemble of devices configured to operate in both the single-dot and flopping-mode regimes. Our model accounts for the valley physics of conduction band electrons in silicon and realistic alloy disorder in the SiGe barrier layers, allowing us to investigate device-to-device variability. We include charge and magnetic noise, as well as spin relaxation processes arising from charge noise and electron-phonon coupling. We find that the two operating modes exhibit significantly different susceptibilities to the various noise sources, with valley splitting and spin relaxation times also playing a role in their relative performance. For realistic noise strengths, we find that single-dot gate fidelities are limited by magnetic noise while flopping-mode fidelities are primarily limited by charge noise and spin relaxation. For sufficiently long spin relaxation times, flopping-mode spin operation is feasible with orders-of-magnitude lower drive power and gate fidelities that are on par with conventional single-dot electric dipole spin resonance.</description>

      <title>Current-linear emergent induction of pinned skyrmion textures in an oxide bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent electromagnetic induction (EEMI) induced through current-driven spin dynamics was recently predicted and subsequently observed in helical spin magnets, opening a new direction in spintronics and paving the way towards further miniaturization of electronic circuit elements. In contrast to conventional inductors consisting of coil-like structures whose inductance $L$ shows a linear dependence on the cross-section $A$, emergent inductors exhibit an inverse ($\propto {A}^{-1}$) proportionality, favorable for the miniaturization of electrical devices. However, the expected current-linear response of the EEMI voltage has not been demonstrated. Magnetic skyrmions hold promise as a simple platform to study the conceptual foundations of EEMI from current-driven spin dynamics. We fabricated devices of thin film bilayers of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic SrIrO$_3$, which are known to host interfacial N\'eel skyrmions detected by the appearance of a topological Hall-effect (THE). A large, positive and current-linear inductive response is found to accompany the THE. In our experiment, the current-induced dynamics of pinned magnetic skyrmions creates a voltage both parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric current flow, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse induction, respectively. This is the first report of transverse EEMI, indicating an angle of $80^{\circ}$ between skyrmion motion and the applied current. Our observation of current-linear longitudinal and transverse EEMI is a hallmark of pinned dynamics of magnetic skyrmion textures in oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>"Berry Trashcan" Model of Interacting Electrons in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for interacting electrons in a continuum band structure that resembles a ``trashcan'', with a flat bottom of radius $k_b$ beyond which the dispersion increases rapidly with velocity $v$. The form factors of the Bloch wavefunctions can be well-approximated by the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, which encodes the uniform Berry curvature. We demonstrate how this model captures the salient features of the low-energy Hamiltonian for electron-doped pristine $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene (R$n$G) for appropriate values of the displacement field, and provide corresponding expressions for $k_b$. In the regime where the Fermi wavevector is close to $k_b$, we analytically solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a gapped Wigner crystal in several limits of the model. We introduce a new method, the sliver-patch approximation, which extends the previous few-patch approaches and is crucial in both differentiating even vs odd Chern numbers of the ground state and gapping the Hartree-Fock solution. A key parameter is the Berry flux $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ enclosed by the (flat) bottom of the band. We analytically show that there is a ferromagnetic coupling between the signs of $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ and the Chern number $C$ of the putative Wigner crystal. We also study the competition between the $C=0$ and $1$ solutions as a function of the interaction potential for parameters relevant to R$n$G. By exhaustive comparison to numerical Hartree-Fock calculations, we demonstrate how the analytic results capture qualitative trends of the phase diagram, as well as quantitative details such as the enhancement of the effective velocity. Our analysis paves the way for an analytic and numerical examination of the stability and competition beyond mean-field theory of the Wigner crystals in this model.</description>

      <title>Light Drag in a Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Large symmetry and hierarchical ordering transitions in sliding ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals "sliding" ferroelectric bilayers, whose electric polarization is locked to the interlayer alignment, show promise for future non-volatile memory and other nanoelectronic devices. These applications require a fuller understanding of the polarization stability and switching properties, which present models have described in terms of an Ising-like binary polarization. However, it is a much larger translation symmetry that is broken in the polar state. Here we introduce a discrete statistical-mechanical model that emphasizes the effect of this larger symmetry. Through Monte-Carlo numerics we show this model possesses a richer phase diagram, including an intermediate critical phase of algebraically-correlated polarization. A low energy effective theory allows us to connect the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class, driven by excitations not available in Ising-like models. Our results indicate the need for theoretical models of this ferroelectric system to account for the larger symmetry.</description>

      <title>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</title>

Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Locating the Atoms at the Hard-soft Interface of Gold Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface structure affects the growth, shape and properties of nanoparticles. In wet chemical syntheses, metal additives and surfactants are used to modify surfaces and guide nanocrystal growth. To understand this process, it is critical to understand how the surface structure is modified. However, measuring the type and arrangement of atoms at hard-soft interfaces on nanoscale surfaces, especially in the presence of surfactants, is extremely challenging. Here, we determine the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface in a metallic nanoparticle by developing low-dose imaging conditions in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy that are preferentially sensitive to surface adatoms. By revealing experimentally the copper additives and bromide surfactant counterion at the surface of a gold nanocuboid and quantifying their interatomic distances, our direct, low-dose imaging method provides atomic-level understanding of chemically sophisticated nanomaterial surface structures. These measurements of the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface provide the information necessary to understand and quantify surface chemistries and energies and their pivotal role in nanocrystal growth.</description>

      <title>Capturing an Electron in the Virtual State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a foundational question in quantum mechanics: can a particle be directly found in a classically forbidden virtual state? We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.</description>

      <title>Prediction of two-dimensional ferromagnetic VO$_2$ layers in the hexagonal and tetragonal phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional materials is of great significance and has become an emerging topic. The ferromagnetic VS$_2$ and VSe$_2$ monolayers have been experimentally synthesized, and O element belongs to the same group as S and Se elements. Thus, whether there exists the ferromagnetic VO$_2$ monolayer is a necessary and urgent question. Using first-principles methods within the framework of density functional theory, we predict two kinds of VO$_2$ monolayers with the hexagonal and tetragonal phases and investigate their structural stability, electronic and magnetic properties, and ferromagnetic phase transition. The computational results demonstrate that the two two-dimensional structural phases are stable and possess the ferromagnetic ground states, and they are half-metal with large energy gap. In addition, by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo simulation methods, the ferromagnetic phase transition at 270 K in the hexagonal phase is determined. These findings not only predict a new type of intrinsic half-metallic ferromagnet with a high Curie temperature but also fill in an important gap that are lacking in the series of studies from VO$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, to VTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Emerging orthorhombic two-dimensional van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials has expanded to include a great variety of magnetic phases, over a short decade since its first discovery in 2016-2017. However, most of the investigated vdW magnets so far have highly symmetric crystal fields and isotropic in-plane lattice structures, making their 2D magnetism robust but often classical and expected. In this Perspective, we highlight a family of vdW magnets that have distorted crystal fields with low symmetries and orthorhombic crystal lattices with strong anisotropy, and furthermore, show their prospects for realizing a much richer landscape of magnetic phases and phase transitions. First, we introduce the classification of 2D vdW magnets based on their crystal fields and make a contrast between the orthorhombic vdW magnets of focus here and other popular honeycomb/hexagonal/kagome vdW magnets. We then discuss the material candidates, the emergent properties, and the designed controls for these orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, using the representative CrSBr as an example and extending beyond it. Finally, we discuss a few existing challenges in orthorhombic 2D vdW magnets, overcome which would pave the way towards magneto-optical, opto-magnetic, and spintronic devices based on orthorhombic 2D vdW magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous capsules have been the subject of intense investigation in the field of drug delivery. One of the essential properties of such particles, which requires characterization, is their structure. Many experimental techniques have been used for this purpose, such as wide-angle neutron or X-ray scattering, or light scattering. Herein, we report theoretical data on the relationship between the size, porosity and drag force of porous particles. Data were obtained from a numerical procedure based on the lattice Boltzmann method for the calculation of the creeping flow over porous spherical objects. Previous analytical solutions to the hydrodynamic equations yielded different predictions for the drag force under conditions of high permeability. In the light of our findings, we compared our data to previous divergent analytical solutions and analyzed experimental results for dynamic and static light scattering of porous membrane vesicles Our findings strongly indicate a potential source of error that has led to inconsistencies in DLS measurements when compared to other techniques.</description>

      <title>Magneto-transport signatures in periodically-driven Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.04281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic driving (for example, by shining circularly polarized light) on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, in the planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups. We incorporate the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results, obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Large circular photogalvanic effect in non-centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi with simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries has opened up new avenues for research into the interaction between light and topologically protected bands. In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$-axis of the crystal - a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands in moir\'e systems are exciting new playgrounds for the generation and study of exotic many-body physics phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial localization of the flat-band states. Here we use numerical simulations to examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path can actually increase with increasing disorder strength.This phenomenon is also captured by the disorder-dependent quantum metric, which is directly linked to the ground state localization.This disorder-induced delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other related moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``non-local" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.</description>

      <title>Observation of edge and bulk states in a three-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chain of quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs). These zero-energy states are expected to be localised on the edges of the chain, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunneling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional systems based on black phosphorus (BP) have recently attracted much interest. Since the crystal structure of BP consists of 2D layers with a strong in-plane anisotropy, its electronic properties at a high magnetic field ($B$) are quite interesting. Here, we report a magneto-optical study of bulk BP at high $B$ to 12 T perpendicular to the 2D layers. In the obtained optical conductivity spectra, periodic peaks are clearly observed corresponding to Landau levels of up to $n$=6 quantum number. They exhibit almost linear shifts with $B$, and from their analysis an electron-hole reduced mass of 0.13 $m_0$ is obtained, where $m_0$ is the electron mass. Many of the peaks appear in pairs, which is interpreted in terms of Zeeman splitting and an electron-hole combined $g$-factor of 6.6 is obtained. In addition, magnetoexciton peaks are observed to shift quadratically with $B$, and the exciton binding energy at $B$=0 is estimated to be 9.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Stability of chiral magnon condensates in collinear antiferromagnetic insulators</title>

Abstract: Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of great interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is (meta)stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-component magnon condensation. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.</description>

      <title>Proximity Effects Between the Graphene Quasicrystal and Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.</description>

      <title>Universality in diffusion-controlled nucleation and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral split magnons in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{\'e}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent electronic structure of ultrathin perovskite bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistronics has received much attention as a new method to manipulate the properties of 2D van der Waals structures by introducing moir\'e patterns through a relative rotation between two layers. Here we begin a theoretical exploration of twistronics beyond the realm of van der Waals materials by developing a first-principles description of the electronic structure and interlayer interactions of ultrathin perovskite bilayers. We construct both an ab initio tight-binding model as well as a minimal 3-band effective model for the valence bands of monolayers and bilayers of oxides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of perovskites, which is amenable to thin-layer formation. We illustrate the approach with the specific example of Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ layers but also provide model parameters for Ca$_2$TiO$_4$ and Ba$_2$TiO$_4$ .</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal CW polarization-tomography of photon pairs from the biexciton radiative cascade: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>
