      <title>Effects of Thom disk on alleviating ground effects of a wall-mounted rotating cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of Thom disks on alleviating ground effects by wall-mounted rotating cylinders, also known as Flettner rotors, which utilize wind energy for ship propulsion. Through three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, our findings reveal that introducing a secondary Thom disk near the ground significantly reduces the three-dimensional flow pattern induced by the ground, leading to a more uniform pressure distribution along the rotor's surface. We also explore how the vertical placement of a secondary Thom disk influences wake dynamics and aerodynamic forces. Optimal placement of the secondary disk is found at the ground, which maximizes the lift-to-drag ratio.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling for On-Demand Flow Prescription in Fan-Array Wind Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fan-array wind tunnels are an emerging technology to design bespoke wind fields through grids of individually controllable fans. This design is especially suited for the turbulent, dynamic, non-uniform flow conditions found close to the ground, and has enabled applications from entomology to flight on Mars. However, due to the high dimensionality of fan-array actuation and the complexity of unsteady fluid flow, the physics of fan arrays are not fully characterized, making it difficult to prescribe arbitrary flow fields. Accessing the full capability of fan arrays requires resolving the map from time-varying grids of fan speeds to three-dimensional unsteady flow fields, which remains an open problem. This map is unfeasible to span in a single study, but it can be partitioned and studied in subsets. In this paper, we study the special case of constant fan-speeds and time-averaged streamwise velocities with one homogeneous spanwise axis. We produce a proof-of-concept surrogate model by fitting a regularized linear map to a dataset of fan-array measurements. We use this model as the basis for an open-loop control scheme to design flow profiles subject to constraints on fan speeds. In experimental validation, our model scored a mean prediction error of 1.02 m/s and our control scheme a mean tracking error of 1.05 m/s in a fan array with velocities up to 12 m/s. We empirically conclude that the physics relating constant fan speeds to time-averaged streamwise velocities are dominated by linear dynamics, and present our method as a foundational step to fully resolve fan-array wind tunnel control.</description>

      <title>Effect of local flow geometry on particle pair dispersion angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine experiments in a von K\'arm\'an flow with numerical simulations of Taylor-Green and homogeneous and isotropic turbulence to study the effect of the local flow geometry on particle pair dispersion. To characterize particle dispersion we use the pair dispersion angle, defined as the angle between the relative position and relative velocity of particle pairs. This angle was recently introduced as a means to more effectively identify the different dispersion regimes in finite-Reynolds-number flows. Our results show that, at a global scale, all flows considered show similar dispersion properties in terms of this metric, characterized by ballistic, super-diffusive, and diffusive regimes. Locally, however, these systems exhibit distinct behaviors, with anisotropies and local geometric features significantly influencing dispersion in both the von K\'arm\'an and Taylor-Green flows.</description>

      <title>Discovering Boundary Equations for Wave Breaking using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many supervised machine learning methods have revolutionised the empirical modelling of complex systems. These empirical models, however, are usually "black boxes" and provide only limited physical explanations about the underlying systems. Instead, so-called "knowledge discovery" methods can be used to explore the governing equations that describe observed phenomena. This paper focuses on how we can use such methods to explore underlying physics and also model a commonly observed yet not fully understood phenomenon - the breaking of ocean waves. In our work, we use symbolic regression to explore the equation that describes wave-breaking evolution from a dataset of in silico waves generated using expensive numerical methods. Our work discovers a new boundary equation that provides a reduced-order description of how the surface elevation (i.e., the water-air interface) evolves forward in time, including the instances when the wave breaks - a problem that has defied traditional approaches. Compared to the existing empirical models, the unique equation-based nature of our model allows further mathematical interpretation, which provides an opportunity to explore the fundamentals of breaking waves. Further expert-AI collaborative research reveals the physical meaning of each term of the discovered equation, which suggests a new characteristic of breaking waves in deep water - a decoupling between the water-air interface and the fluid velocities. This novel reduced-order model also hints at computationally efficient ways to simulate breaking waves for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Thin film flow over a spinning disc: Experiments and direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of thin liquid films flowing over a spinning disc is studied through a combination of experiments and direct numerical simulations. We consider a comprehensive range of interfacial flow regimes from waveless through to three-dimensional (3D) waves, and for previously unexplored inertia-dominated conditions that have practical relevance. The transition between these regimes is categorised within a phase map based on two governing parameters that correspond to modified inverse Weber ($\lambda$) and Ekman numbers ($r_{disc}$). Our findings show that stationary two-dimensional (2D) spiral waves, which unfold in the direction of rotation from the Coriolis effect, transition to 3D waves with the emergence of small perturbations on the wavefronts. These non-stationary structures grow asymmetrically in the 2D-3D transitional region, and detach from the parent spiral wave to form wavelets or so-called $\Lambda$ solitons. We show that during and after this wave formation process, flow circulations unique to the spinning disc arrangement are present within the main wave hump. Furthermore, when combined with observations of wall strain rates and topology within the film, these findings elucidate the mechanisms that underpin the apparent wave-induced interfacial turbulence effects observed for spinning disc flows.</description>

      <title>Propulsive performance of a windsurf-inspired pitching foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally a symmetrical rigid foil performing pitching oscillations around a mean incidence angle ($\alpha_{m}$) with respect to an incoming flow in a hydrodynamic channel at a constant velocity where the Reynolds number according to the chord of the foil is, $Re_{c} = \rho U_{\infty} c / \mu = 14400$. The problem is inspired from the pumping maneuver used by athletes on the new hydrofoil-based windsurf boards. The goal of the study is to quantify the forces on this configuration by varying the pitching kinematics characterized by the Strouhal number ($St_{A} = fA/U_{\infty}$), from 0 to 0.27, and the mean incidence angle $\alpha_{m}$, from 0 to 30$^{\circ}$, of the foil. The force measurements show a high lift production and the delay of the stall angle according to $St_A$ which can be linked to previous studies about the generation of vortices at the trailing edge. A general trend of decrease is observed for the drag force coefficient in pitching compare to the static case. For the highest Strouhal numbers tested, drag coefficient can become negative (thrust) in a range of $\alpha_{m}$ up to 15$^{\circ}$ in specific case. We present the various impacts of the amplitude of beating and the frequency of pitching on the aerodynamic forces for small mean incidence angle and high mean incidence angle (above the static stall angle). By using a sport-mimetic approach, we transform the measured lift $\&amp;$ drag forces into a propulsive and drifting force. Doing so allows us to investigate race strategies. We investigate the generation of propulsion in upwind conditions.</description>

      <title>Generation of cosmic ray trajectories by a Diffusion Model trained on test particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on elastic substrates: force scaling crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia -- long thought to follow inertial force scaling -- can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.</description>

      <title>DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiFfRG (Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows), a comprehensive computational C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows in very general truncation schemes. Its central features are threefold: Firstly, the use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and quantitatively reliable computations of field dependences. Secondly, the (simultaneous) setup of large, fully momentum-dependent vertex expansions. Thirdly, efficient time-discretisation methods, incorporating insights from studies of solving theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, going hand in hand with shocks and an exponential increase of the information flow velocity in field space. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFfRG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included: finite temperature O(N) theory, a Quark-Meson model, SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and four-Fermi flows in the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models and time-frequency heat maps for surface gravity waves generated by thin ships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research suggests that studying the time-frequency response of ship wave signals has potential to shed light on a range of applications, such as inferring the dynamical and geometric properties of a moving vessel based on the surface elevation data detected at a single point in space. We continue this line of research here with a study of mathematical models for thin ships using standard Wigley hulls and Wigley transom-stern hulls as examples. Mathematical models of varying sophistication are considered. These include basic minimal models which use applied pressure distributions as proxies for the ship hull. The more complicated models are Michell's thin ship theory and the Hogner model, both of which explicitly take into account the shape of the hull. We outline a methodology for carefully choosing the form and parameter values in the minimal models such that they reproduce the key features of the more complicated models in the time-frequency domain. For example, we find that a two-pressure model is capable of producing wave elevation signals that have a similar time-frequency profile as that for Michell's thin ship theory applied to the Wigley hull, including the crucially important features caused by interference between waves created at the bow and stern of the ship. One of the key tools in our analysis is the spectrogram, which is a heat-map visualisation in the time-frequency domain. Our work here extends the existing knowledge on the topic of spectrograms of ship waves. The theoretical results in this study are supported by experimental data collected in a towing tank at the Australian Maritime College using model versions of the standard Wigley hulls and Wigley transom-stern hulls.</description>

      <title>The role of time integration in energy conservation in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics fluid dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of a time integration scheme is a crucial aspect of any transient fluid simulation, and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is no exception. The influence of the time integration scheme on energy balance is here addressed. To do so, explicit expressions allowing to compute the deviations from the energy balance, induced by the time integration scheme, are provided. These expressions, computed \textit{a posteriori}, are valid for different integration methods. Such formulation is tested with the simulation of a two-dimensional non-viscous impact of two jets, with no artificial dissipation terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stable simulation of a non-dissipative system with a weakly-compressible SPH method. A viscous case, the Taylor-Green vortex, has also been simulated. Results show that an implicit time integration scheme also behaves better in a viscous context.</description>

Abstract: We present a surface analog to a dripping faucet, where a viscous liquid slides down an immiscible meniscus. Periodic pinch-off of the dripping filament is observed, generating a succession of monodisperse floating lenses. We show that this interfacial dripping faucet can be described analogously to its single-phase counterpart, replacing surface tension by the spreading coefficient, and even undergoes a transition to a jetting regime. This liquid/liquid/gas system opens perspectives for the study of the dynamics of emulsions at interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the large body of research on coalescence, firm agreement between experiment, theory, and computation has not been established for the very first moments following the initial contact of two liquid volumes. Combining a range of experimental and computational modeling approaches in two different geometries, namely drop-drop and drop-bath configurations, we have been able to elucidate the influence of the intervening gas and van der Waals forces on coalescence. For simple liquids considered here, the gas influences both pre- and post-contact regimes, with jump-to-contact being the primary mode of merging. Subsequently, wave-like air pockets are observed and ultimately influence the initial opening dynamics of the neck.</description>

      <title>Turbulent flows over porous and rough substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows over porous substrates are studied via a systematic exploration of the dependence of the flow properties on the substrate parameters, including permeability $K$, grain pitch $L$, and depth $h$. The study uses direct numerical simulations mainly for staggered-cube substrates with $L^+\approx10$ - $50$, $\sqrt{K}/L\approx0.01$ - $0.25$, and depths from $h=O(L)$ to $h\gg L$, ranging from typical impermeable rough surfaces to deep porous substrates. The results indicate that the permeability has significantly greater relevance than the grain size and microscale topology for the properties of the overlying flow, including the mean-flow slip and the shear across the interface, the drag increase relative to smooth-wall flow, and the statistics and spectra of the overlying turbulence, whereas the direct effect of grain size is only noticeable near the interface as grain-coherent flow fluctuations. The substrate depth also has a significant effect, with shallower substrates suppressing the effective transpiration at the interface. Based on the direct-simulation results, we propose an empirical `equivalent permeability' $K_{eq}^t$, that incorporates this effect and scales well the overlying turbulence for substrates with different depths, permeabilities, etc. Based on this, we propose a conceptual $h^+$-$\sqrt{K^+}$ regime diagram where, for any given substrate topology, turbulence transitions smoothly from that over impermeable rough surfaces with $h=O(L)$ to that over deep porous substrates with $h^+\gtrsim50$, with the latter limit determined by the typical lengthscale of the overlying pressure fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We study the process of thermal convection in jammed emulsions with a yield-stress rheology. We find that heat transfer occurs via an intermittent mechanism, whereby intense short-lived convective "heat bursts" are spaced out by long-lasting conductive periods. This behaviour is the result of a sequence of fluidization-rigidity transitions, rooted in a non-trivial interplay between emulsion yield-stress rheology and plastic activity, which we characterize via a statistical analysis of the dynamics at the droplet scale. We also show that droplets' coalescence induced during heat bursts leads to a spatially heterogeneous phase-inversion of the emulsion which eventually supports a sustained convective state.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of fluid front dynamics driven by porous media pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14666</link>

Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the material's interior, these porous media have the tendency to replenish the air, effectively acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert a porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel, studying the dynamics of the liquid-air front. In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterize the behavior of this kind of pumps and the dynamics of the liquid-air front. This model allows us to use porous media pumps as very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way, being able to obtain characteristic properties of fluids such as viscosity or the pressure applied to them. We have tested it using experimental data from the literature, and we have been able to observe that the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, being able to affirm that the model is correctly satisfied. This type of pump is of great interest to the scientific community because of its small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

      <title>Motion of a floating sphere pulled by a string and induced flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in this article the motion of a floating ball attached to a soft string set in circular motion through its other end. Although simple, the system exhibits rich dynamics that we investigate experimentally and theoretically. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which challenges common intuition based on centrifugal force. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. Experimental measurements of the generated flow show that a Magnus force must be taken into account to correctly explain all the observations. In particular, our deformable system allows to measure the ratio of the lift force over the inertial force. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, showing that the ball can robustly trap itself at the center of the flow generated by its past motion. The present experiment also revisits the famous 'tea-leaf paradox', which refers to the unexpected migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the latter is mixed with a rigid spoon. The ball attached to the string plays the role of a deformable spoon, and we show that there exists a maximum rotation speed above which the tea-leaves transport brutally stops.</description>

      <title>Calculating Spectra by Sequential High-Pass Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand on the method of sequential filtering for calculating spectra of inhomogeneous fields. Sadek &amp; Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)] showed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a power-law spectrum $k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;p+2$ by low-pass filtering. Here, we show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper spectra with $\alpha&lt;2p+3$ using the same $p$-th order kernel. For example, any spectrum of a field that is shallower than $k^{-5}$ can be extracted by sequential high-pass filtering using any 1st order kernel such as a Gaussian or top-hat. Finally, we demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to capture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>
