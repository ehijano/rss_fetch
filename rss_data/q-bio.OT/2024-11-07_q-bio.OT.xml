      <title>Curiosity-Driven Science: The in Situ Jungle Biomechanics Lab in the Amazon Rainforest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field work is an essential component not just for organismal biology, but also for the expanding umbrella of disciplines which have turned their attention towards living systems. Observing organisms in naturalistic contexts is a critical component of discovery; however, conducting field research can be a massive barrier for scientists who do not have experience working with organisms in a naturalistic context under challenging field conditions. Here we propose 8 critical steps for organizing and executing interdisciplinary curiosity-driven field research, drawing on the insights from The in Situ Jungle Biomechanics Lab (JBL). The JBL program is a field research course that helps early-career scientists gain experience in organizing and conducting interdisciplinary field research. JBL uses a curiosity-driven approach to field science education by encouraging early-career researchers to explore scientific questions in the Peruvian Amazon with a non-prescriptive approach to research output. We achieve an inclusive research space by bringing scientists from across disciplines together, with local communities to collaborate and spark new questions and ideas. To stoke curiosity, the JBL imparts a naturalist tradition set forth by organismal biologists of the 20th century who have extolled the merits of observing the natural world as a form of scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Beyond networks, towards adaptive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their widespread utility across domains, basic network models face fundamental limitations when applied to complex biological systems, particularly in neuroscience. This paper critically examines these limitations and explores potential extensions and alternative frameworks better suited to capture the adaptive nature of biological systems. Key challenges include: the need to account for time-varying connections and adaptive topologies; the difficulty in representing multilevel systems with cross-level interactions; the inadequacy of fixed state spaces for systems that continuously expand their range of possible states; and the challenge of modeling deep history dependence and open-world interactions. While some limitations can be partially addressed through extensions like multilayer networks and time-varying connections, I argue that biological systems exhibit radical context dependence and open-endedness that resist conventional mathematical formalization. Using examples primarily from neuroscience, I demonstrate how even sophisticated approaches incorporating dynamics and context sensitivity fall short in fully capturing biological complexity. Moving forward requires developing frameworks that explicitly account for adaptive reconfiguration, embrace open-ended state spaces, and draw inspiration from concepts like Kauffman's "adjacent possible." The path ahead demands mathematical and computational approaches that are fundamentally more dynamic and flexible than traditional network models.</description>
