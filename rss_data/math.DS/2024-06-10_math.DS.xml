      <title>Entropy bounds for Glass networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that chaotic Glass networks (a class of piecewise-linear Ordinary Differential Equations) are good candidates for the design of true random number generators. A Glass network design has the advantage of involving only standard Boolean logic gates. Furthermore, an already chaotic (deterministic) system combined with random ``jitter'' due to thermal noise can be used to generate random bit sequences in a more robust way than noisy limit-cycle oscillators. Since the goal is to generate bit sequences with as large a positive entropy as possible, it is desirable to have a theoretical method to assess the irregularity of a large class of networks. We develop a procedure here to calculate good upper bounds on the entropy of a Glass network, by means of symbolic representations of the continuous dynamics. Our method improves on a result by Farcot (2006), and allows in principle for an arbitrary level of precision by refinements of the estimate, and we show that in the limiting case, these estimates converge to the true entropy of the symbolic system corresponding to the continuous dynamics. As a check on the method, we demonstrate for an example network that our upper bound after only a few refinement steps is very close to the entropy estimated from a long numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth folds are tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonsmooth fold is where an equilibrium or limit cycle of a nonsmooth dynamical system hits a switching manifold and collides and annihilates with another solution of the same type. We show that beyond the bifurcation the leading-order truncation to the system in general has no bounded invariant set. This is proved for boundary equilibrium bifurcations of Filippov systems, hybrid systems, and continuous piecewise-smooth ODEs, and grazing-type events for which the truncated form is a continuous piecewise-linear map. The omitted higher-order terms are expected to be incapable of altering the local dynamics qualitatively, implying the system has no local invariant set on one side of a nonsmooth fold, and we demonstrate this with an example. Thus if the equilibrium or limit cycle is attracting the bifurcation causes the local attractor of the system to tip to a new state. The results also help explain global aspects of the bifurcation structures of the truncated systems.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the Apollonian gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Apollonian gasket is a well-studied circle packing. Important properties of the packing, including the distribution of the circle radii, are governed by its Hausdorff dimension. No closed form is currently known for the Hausdorff dimension, and its computation is a special case of a more general and hard problem: effective, rigorous estimates of dimension of a parabolic limit set. In this paper we develop an efficient method for solving this problem which allows us to compute the dimension of the gasket to 128 decimal places and rigorously justify the error bounds. We expect our approach to generalise easily to other parabolic fractals.</description>

      <title>Planar chemical reaction systems with algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilbert number $H(n)$ is defined as the maximum number of limit cycles of a planar autonomous system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with right-hand sides containing polynomials of degree at most $n \in {\mathbb N}$. The dynamics of chemical reaction systems with two chemical species can be (under mass-action kinetics) described by such planar autonomous ODEs, where $n$ is equal to the maximum order of the chemical reactions in the system. Generalizations of the Hilbert number $H(n)$ to three different classes of chemical reaction networks are investigated: (i) chemical systems with reactions up to the $n$-th order; (ii) systems with up to $n$-molecular chemical reactions; and (iii) weakly reversible chemical reaction networks. In each case (i), (ii) and (iii), the question on the number of limit cycles is considered. Lower bounds on the generalized Hilbert numbers are provided for both algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles. Furthermore, given a general algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ of degree $n_h \in {\mathbb N}$ and containing one or more ovals in the positive quadrant, a chemical system is constructed which has the oval(s) as its stable algebraic limit cycle(s). The ODEs describing the dynamics of the constructed chemical system contain polynomials of degree at most $n=2\,n_h+1.$ Considering $n_h \ge 4,$ the algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ can contain multiple closed components with the maximum number of ovals given by Harnack's curve theorem as $1+(n_h-1)(n_h-2)/2$, which is equal to 4 for $n_h=4.$ Algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ with $n_h=4$ and the maximum number of four ovals is used to construct a chemical system which has four stable algebraic limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of phase-amplitude dynamics from electrophysiological signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signals from interacting brain regions display transient synchronization of phases and amplitudes in different frequencies. Commonly, the interaction between regions of the brain is quantitatively described by either analyzing the correlations of amplitudes of the measured signals or by calculating phase-synchronization measures. However, for a complete picture of the interactions it is important to analyze the dynamics of both the amplitude and the phase. In this work, we present a new method for finding the coupling between brain regions by reconstructing the phase-amplitude dynamics directly from the measured electrophysiological signals. For this purpose, we use the recent advances in the field of phase-amplitude reduction of oscillatory systems, which allow the representation of an uncoupled oscillatory system as a phase-amplitude oscillator in a unique form using transformations (parametrizations) related to the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. By combining the parametrization method and the Fourier-Laplace averaging method of finding the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, we developed a novel method of assessing the transformation functions from the signals of the interacting oscillatory systems. The resulting reconstructed dynamical system is a network of phase-amplitude oscillators with the interactions between them represented as coupling functions in phase and amplitude coordinates. Using synthetic signals generated from several models with known and unknown theoretical phase-amplitude reduced forms, we demonstrate that our method is capable of finding the proper unique dynamic form of these oscillatory systems in the reduced phase-amplitude space. Our method can be applied to describe any network of interacting oscillators as a dynamical system using signals of the network elements.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion and singularity structures of front solutions in multi-component FitzHugh-Nagumo-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of front solutions in a certain class of multi-component reaction-diffusion systems, where one fast component governed by an Allen-Cahn equation is weakly coupled to a system of $N$ linear slow reaction-diffusion equations. By using geometric singular perturbation theory, Evans function analysis and center manifold reduction, we demonstrate that and how the complexity of the front motion can be controlled by the choice of coupling function and the dimension $N$ of the slow part of the multi-component reaction-diffusion system. On the one hand, we show how to imprint and unfold a given scalar singularity structure. On the other hand, for $N\geq 3$ we show how chaotic behaviour of the front speed arises from the unfolding of a nilpotent singularity via the breaking of a Shil'nikov homoclinic orbit. The rigorous analysis is complemented by a numerical study that is heavily guided by our analytic findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H. Furstenberg defined Central sets in $\mathbb{N}$ by using the notions of topological dynamics, later Bergelson and Hindman characterized central sets in $\mathbb{N}$ and also in arbitrary semigroup in terms of algebra of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of that set. We state the new notion of large sets in a partial semigroup setting and characterize the algebraic structure of the sets by using the algebra of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification. By using these notions, we introduce the \emph{Partial Semigroup Partial Dynamical System(PSPDS)} and show that topological dynamical characterization of central sets in a partial semigroup is equivalent to the usual algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recurrent Network Topologies for Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Strong Fast Invertibility and Lyapunov Exponents for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019 Anthony Quas, Philippe Thieullen and Mohamed Zarrabi introduced the concept of strong fast invertibility for linear cocycles. It relates the growth of volumes between different initial times and, together with a condition on singular value gaps, yields the existence of a dominated splitting of the dynamics. The properties of this splitting largely coincide with those for systems with stable Lyapunov exponents.
  In this article, we take a closer look at strongly fast invertible systems with bounded coefficients. By linking the dimensions at which a system admits strong fast invertibility to the multiplicities of Lyapunov exponents, we are able to give a full characterization of regular strongly fast invertible systems similar to that of systems with stable Lyapunov exponents. In particular, we show that the stability of Lyapunov exponents implies strong fast invertibility (even in the absence of regularity). Central to our arguments are certain induced systems on spaces of exterior products that represent the evolution of volumes.
  Finally, we derive convergence results for the computation of Lyapunov exponents via Benettin's algorithm using perturbation theory. While the stronger assumption of stable Lyapunov exponents clearly leaves more freedom on how to choose stepsizes, we derive conditions for the stepsizes with which convergence can be ensured even if a system is only strongly fast invertible.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation) II: geometric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nine geometric systems: Miquel dynamics, P-nets, integrable cross-ratio maps, discrete holomorphic functions, orthogonal circle patterns, polygon recutting, circle intersection dynamics, (corrugated) pentagram maps and the short diagonal hyperplane map. Using a unified framework, for each system we prove an explicit expression for the solution as a function of the initial data; more precisely, we show that the solution is equal to the ratio of two partition functions of an oriented dimer model on an Aztec diamond whose face weights are constructed from the initial data. Then, we study the Devron property [Gli15], which states the following: if the system starts from initial data that is singular for the backwards dynamics, this singularity is expected to reoccur after a finite number of steps of the forwards dynamics. Again, using a unified framework, we prove this Devron property for all of the above geometric systems, for different kinds of singular initial data. In doing so, we obtain new singularity results and also known ones [Gli15, Yao14]. Our general method consists in proving that these nine geometric systems are all related to the Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation), and then to rely on the companion paper [AdTM22], where we study this recurrence in general, prove explicit expressions and singularity results.</description>

Abstract: The Bifurcation from a Simple Eigenvalue (BSE) Theorem is the foundation of steady-state bifurcation theory for one-parameter families of functions. When eigenvalues of multiplicity greater than one are caused by symmetry, the Equivariant Branching Lemma (EBL) can often be applied to predict the branching of solutions. The EBL can be interpreted as the application of the BSE Theorem to a fixed point subspace. There are functions which have invariant linear subspaces that are not caused by symmetry. For example, networks of identical coupled cells often have such invariant subspaces. We present a generalization of the EBL, where the BSE Theorem is applied to nested invariant subspaces. We call this the Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces (BLIS). We give several examples of bifurcations and determine if BSE, EBL, or BLIS apply. We extend our previous automated bifurcation analysis algorithms to use the BLIS to simplify and improve the detection of branches created at bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many, if not most, systems of interest in science are naturally described as nonlinear dynamical systems. Empirically, we commonly access these systems through time series measurements. Often such time series may consist of discrete random variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for scientific applications, our framework is fully \textit{generative}, producing, after training, trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground truth system.</description>

      <title>Elementary catastrophes underlying bifurcations of vector fields and PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A practical method was proposed recently for finding local bifurcation points in an n-dimensional vector field F by seeking their 'underlying catastrophes'. Here we apply the idea to the homogeneous steady states of a partial differential equation as an example of the role that catastrophes can play in reaction diffusion. What are these 'underlying' catastrophes? We then show they essentially define a restricted class of 'solvable' rather than 'all classifiable' singularities, by identifying degenerate zeros of a vector field F without taking into account its vectorial character. As a result they are defined by a minimal set of r analytic conditions that provide a practical means to solve for them, and a huge reduction from the calculations needed to classify a singularity, which we will also enumerate here. In this way, underlying catastrophes seem to allow us apply Thom's elementary catastrophes in much broader contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a threshold decision-making framework for controlling the physical dynamics of an agent switching between two spatial tasks. Our framework couples a nonlinear opinion dynamics model that represents the evolution of an agent's preference for a particular task with the physical dynamics of the agent. We prove the bifurcation that governs the behavior of the coupled dynamics. We show by means of the bifurcation behavior how the coupled dynamics are adaptive to the physical constraints of the agent. We also show how the bifurcation can be modulated to allow the agent to switch tasks based on thresholds adaptive to environmental conditions. We illustrate the benefits of the approach through a decentralized multi-robot task allocation application for trash collection.</description>

Abstract: We establish a hypertrace characterization of property (T) for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors: Given a $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors $M$, $M$ does not have property (T) if and only if there exists a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ admits a $M$-hypertrace but no normal hypertrace. For $M$ without property (T), such an inclusion $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ also admits almost vanishing Furstenberg entropy. With the same construction of $M\subset \mathcal{A}$, we also establish similar characterizations of Haagerup property for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>
