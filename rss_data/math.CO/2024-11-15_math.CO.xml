      <title>Tight minimum colored degree condition for rainbow connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, and let $c: E \to P$, where $P$ is a set of colors. Let $\delta^c(G) = \min_{v \in V} \{ d^{c}(v) \}$ where $d^c(v)$ is the number of colors on edges incident to a vertex $v$ of $G$. In 2011, Fujita and Magnant showed that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices that satisfies $\delta^c(G)\geq n/2$, then for every two vertices $u, v$ there is a properly-colored $u,v$-path in $G$. In this paper, we show that the same bound for $\delta^c(G)$ implies that any two vertices are connected by a rainbow path.</description>

      <title>Quotient graphs and stochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whenever graphs admit equitable partitions, their quotient graphs highlight the structure evidenced by the partition. It is therefore very natural to ask what can be said about two graphs that have the same quotient according to certain equitable partitions. This question has been connected to the theory of fractional isomorphisms and covers of graphs in well-known results that we briefly survey in this paper. We then depart to develop theory of what happens when the two graphs have the same symmetrized quotient, proving a structural result connecting this with the existence of certain doubly stochastic matrices. We apply this theorem to derive a new characterization of when two graphs have the same combinatorial quotient, and we also study graphs with weighted vertices and the related concept of pseudo-equitable partitions. Our results connect to known old and recent results, and are naturally applicable to study quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on diagonal Ramsey numbers [after Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that if $N$ is sufficiently large, then no matter how one colors the edges among $N$ vertices with two colors, there are always $k$ vertices spanning edges in only one color. Given this theorem, it is natural to ask ``how large is sufficiently large?'' Ramsey's original proof showed that $N=k!$ is sufficient, and five years later Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres improved this bound to $N=4^k$. And then progress stalled for almost 90 years.
  In this survey, I present the history of the problem and discuss some of the ideas used in the recent breakthrough of Campos--Griffiths--Morris--Sahasrabudhe, who proved that $N=3.993^k$ is sufficient.</description>

      <title>The geometry of ranked symplectic matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of my paper "Lattices of flats for symplectic matroids". We explore geometric constructions originating from the lattice of flats of ranked symplectic matroids. We observe that a ranked symplectic matroid always sits between two ordinary matroids and use this fact to prove that it has many of the same properties of ordinary matroids. We compute the dimension of its order complex using its M\"obius function, We show that its matroid polytope is geometrically defined using its flats and connected to its Bergman fan. We finish by highlighting differences between its toric verity and the toric verity of an ordinary matroid, and give a partial proof of Mason's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the number of bipartite graphs with fixed surplus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work on the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph, Do et al. (2023) established upper bounds on the number of connected labeled bipartite graphs with a fixed surplus. We use some recent encodings of bipartite random graphs in order to provide a probabilistic formula for the number of bipartite graphs with fixed surplus. Using this, we obtain asymptotics as the number of vertices in each class tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an Densities for Small Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How small can a set of vertices in the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ be if it meets every copy of $Q_d$? The asymptotic density of such a set (for $d$ fixed and $n$ large) is denoted by $\gamma_d$. It is easy to see that $\gamma_d \leq 1/(d+1)$, and it is known that $\gamma_d=1/(d+1)$ for $d \leq 2$, but it was recently shown that $\gamma_d &lt; 1/(d+1)$ for $d \geq 8$. In this paper we show that the latter phenomenon also holds for $d=7$ and $d=6$.</description>

      <title>Unified bounds for the independence number of graph powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, its $k$-th power $G^k$ is constructed by placing an edge between two vertices if they are within distance $k$ of each other. The $k$-independence number $\alpha_k(G)$ is defined as the independence number of $G^k$. By using general semidefinite programming and polynomial methods, we derive sharp bounds for the $k$-independence number of a graph, which extend and unify various existing results. Our work also allows us to easily derive some new bounds for $\alpha_k(G)$.</description>

      <title>Proof of Frankl's conjecture on cross-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. For any positive integers $n$ and $k$, let $\binom{[n]}{k}$ denote the family of all $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Let $t, s, k, n$ be non-negative integers with $k \geq s+1$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$. In 2016, Frankl proved that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\mathcal{F}$ is $(t+1)$-intersecting and $|\mathcal{F}| \geq 1$, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Furthermore, Frankl conjectured that under an additional condition $\binom{[k+t+s]} {k+t}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$, the following inequality holds: $$ |\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{k+t+s}{k+t}+\binom{n}{k}-\sum_{i=0}^s\binom{k+t+s}{i}\binom{n-k-t-s}{k-i}. $$ In this paper, we prove this conjecture. The key ingredient is to establish a theorem for cross-intersecting families with a restricted universe. Moreover, we derive an analogous result for this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Completely regular codes in graphs covered by a Hamming graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Cayley graphs on the additive group of a small vector space over GF$(q)$, $q=2,3$, we look for completely regular (CR) codes whose parameters are new in Hamming graphs over the same field. The existence of a CR code in such Cayley graph $G$ implies the existence of a CR code with the same parameters in the corresponding Hamming graph that covers $G$. In such a way, we find several completely regular codes with new parameters in Hamming graphs over GF$(3)$. The most interesting findings are two new CR-$1$ (with covering radius~$1$) codes that are independent sets (such CR are equivalent to optimal orthogonal arrays attaining the Bierbrauer--Friedman bound) and one new CR-$2$. By recursive constructions, every knew CR code induces an infinite sequence of CR codes (in particular, optimal orthogonal arrays if the original code was CR-$1$ and independent). In between, we classify feasible parameters of CR codes in several strongly regular graphs.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Codes for Random Access in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and reliable data retrieval is critical for the feasibility of DNA storage, and the development of random access efficiency plays a key role in its practicality and reliability. In this paper, we study the Random Access Problem, which asks to compute the expected number of samples one needs in order to recover an information strand. Unlike previous work, we took a geometric approach to the problem, aiming to understand which geometric structures lead to codes that perform well in terms of reducing the random access expectation (Balanced Quasi-Arcs). As a consequence, two main results are obtained. The first is a construction for $k=3$ that outperforms previous constructions aiming to reduce the random access expectation. The second, exploiting a result from [1], is the proof of a conjecture from [2] for rate $1/2$ codes in any dimension.</description>

      <title>A characterization of positive spanning sets with ties to strongly connected digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive spanning sets (PSSs) are families of vectors that span a given linear space through non-negative linear combinations. Despite certain classes of PSSs being well understood, a complete characterization of PSSs remains elusive. In this paper, we explore a relatively understudied relationship between positive spanning sets and strongly edge-connected digraphs, in that the former can be viewed as a generalization of the latter. We leverage this connection to define a decomposition structure for positive spanning sets inspired by the ear decomposition from digraph theory.</description>

      <title>The \emph{Optimist}: Towards Fully Automated Graph Theory Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the \emph{Optimist}, an autonomous system developed to advance automated conjecture generation in graph theory. Leveraging mixed-integer programming (MIP) and heuristic methods, the \emph{Optimist} generates conjectures that both rediscover established theorems and propose novel inequalities. Through a combination of memory-based computation and agent-like adaptability, the \emph{Optimist} iteratively refines its conjectures by integrating new data, enabling a feedback process with minimal human (\emph{or machine}) intervention. Initial experiments reveal the \emph{Optimist}'s potential to uncover foundational results in graph theory, as well as to produce conjectures of interest for future exploration. This work also outlines the \emph{Optimist}'s evolving integration with a counterpart agent, the \emph{Pessimist} (a human \emph{or machine} agent), to establish a dueling system that will drive fully automated graph theory research.</description>

      <title>On the structure of higher order quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study higher order quantum maps in the context of a *-autonomous category of affine subspaces. We show that types of higher order maps can be identified with certain Boolean functions that we call type functions. By an extension of this identification, the algebraic structure of Boolean functions is inherited by some sets of quantum objects including higher order maps. Using the M\"obius transform, we assign to each type function a poset whose elements are labelled by subsets of indices of the involved spaces. We then show that the type function corresponds to a comb type if and only if the poset is a chain. We also devise a procedure for decomposition of the poset to a set of basic chains from which the type function is constructed by taking maxima and minima of concatenations of the basic chains in different orders. On the level of higher order maps, maxima and minima correspond to affine mixtures and intersections, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiple Cylinder of Relations for Finite Spaces and Nerve Theorem for Strong-Good Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the concept of multiple cylinder of relations which is a generalization of the relation cylinder, extending the multiple non-Hausdorff mapping cylinder to sequences of finite T0-spaces linked by a series of relations.  This construction is important in capturing complex homotopical structures across chains of finite spaces and, when the relations are induced by maps, it serves as a third space that collapses to two distinct finite spaces. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a strong-good cover for simplicial complexes and finite spaces, char acterized by collapsible (rather than merely contractible) intersections. This leads to a strengthened version of the Nerve Theorem, which we develop for simplicial complexes as well as for finite spaces with strong-good covers, demonstrating that these complexes and spaces and their associated nerves maintain the same simple homotopy type, thereby refining classical results for finite simplicial complexes and finite topological structures.</description>

      <title>Inductive construction of path homology chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path homology plays a central role in digraph topology and GLMY theory more general. Unfortunately, the computation of the path homology of a digraph $G$ is a two-step process, and until now no complete description of even the underlying chain complex has appeared in the literature.
  In this paper we introduce an inductive method of constructing elements of the path homology chain modules $\Omega_n(G;R)$ from elements in the proceeding two dimensions. This proceeds via the formation of what we call upper and lower \emph{extensions}, that are parametrised by certain labeled multihypergraphs which we introduce and call \emph{face multihypergraphs}.
  When the coefficient ring $R$ is a finite field the inductive elements we construct generate $\Omega_*(G;R)$. With integral or rational coefficients, the inductive elements generate at least $\Omega_i(G;R)$ for $i=0,1,2,3$. Since in low dimensions the inductive elements extended over labeled multigraphs coincide with naturally occurring generating sets up to sign, they are excellent candidates to reduce to a basis.
  Inductive elements provide a new concrete structure on the path chain complex that can be directly applied to understand path homology, under no restriction on the digraph $G$. We employ inductive elements to construct a sequence of digraphs whose path Euler characteristic can differ arbitrarily depending on the choice of field coefficients. In particular, answering an open question posed by Fu and Ivanov.</description>

Abstract: We develop novel tools for computing the likelihood correspondence of an arrangement of hypersurfaces in a projective space. This uses the module of logarithmic derivations. This object is well-studied in the linear case, when the hypersurfaces are hyperplanes. We here focus on nonlinear scenarios and their applications in statistics and physics.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is \emph{stable}, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Random Lipschitz functions on graphs with weak expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benjamini, Yadin, and Yehudayoff (2007) showed that if the maximum degree of a graph $G$ is 'sub-logarithmic,' then the typical range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms is super-constant. Furthermore, they showed that there is a sharp transition on the range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms on the graph $C_{n,k}$, the tensor product of the $n$-cycle and the complete graph on $k$ vertices with self-loops, around $k=2\log n$. We extend (to some extent) their results to random $M$-Lipschitz functions and random real-valued Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including model theory, discrete geometry, and probability theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}$ be families of subspaces of $Y$. We define a two parameter family of numbers, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$, order $q$, VC-density of the pair \[ (\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}} = (\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\ldots,\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}). \] The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0, q=1$. For $p=0, q &gt; 0$, we recover Shelah's notion of higher-order VC-density for $q$-dependent families. Our definition introduces a new notion when $p&gt;0$. Our main result establishes that that in any model of these theories \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X},\overline{\mathcal{Z}}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] This result generalizes known VC-density bounds in these structures, extending them in multiple ways, as well as providing a uniform proof paradigm applicable to all of them. We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem. We show that with certain restrictions, these results extend to our higher-degree topological setting.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to Zagier's Duality Conjecture on Nahm Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any positive integer $r$, Nahm's problem is to determine all rational $r\times r$ positive definite matrix $A$, $r$-dimensional rational vector $B$ and rational scalar $C$ such that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with $(A,B,C)$ is modular. Around 2007, Zagier conjectured that if the rank $r$ Nahm sum for $(A,B,C)$ is modular, then so is the dual Nahm sum associated with $(A^{-1},A^{-1}B,B^\mathrm{T} A^{-1}B/2-{r}/{24}-C)$. We construct some explicit rank four Nahm sums wherein the original Nahm sum is modular while its dual is not modular. This provides counterexamples to Zagier's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: For the first time we construct an infinite family of Kochen-Specker sets in a space of fixed dimension, namely in R^4. While most of the previous constructions of Kochen-Specker sets have been based on computer search, our construction is analytical and it comes with a short, computer-free proof.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of a family of independent sets for a finite, atomic and graded lattice generalizing the known cryptomorphism between geometric lattices and matroids. This family then gives rise to an embedding theorem into geometric lattices preserving the set of atoms. Lastly we apply these theorems to the concept of adjoint matroids obtaining a characterization and proving a conjecture on the combinatorial derived madtroid for uniform and co-rank 3 matroids.</description>

      <title>Web invariants for flamingo Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Webs yield an especially important realization of certain Specht modules, irreducible representations of symmetric groups, as they provide a pictorial basis with a convenient diagrammatic calculus. In recent work, the last three authors associated polynomials to noncrossing partitions without singleton blocks, so that the corresponding polynomials form a web basis of the pennant Specht module $S^{(d,d,1^{n-2d})}$. These polynomials were interpreted as global sections of a line bundle on a 2-step partial flag variety.
  Here, we both simplify and extend this construction. On the one hand, we show that these polynomials can alternatively be situated in the homogeneous coordinate ring of a Grassmannian, instead of a 2-step partial flag variety, and can be realized as tensor invariants of classical (but highly nonplanar) tensor diagrams. On the other hand, we extend these ideas from the pennant Specht module $S^{(d,d,1^{n-2d})}$ to more general flamingo Specht modules $S^{(d^r,1^{n-rd})}$. In the hook case $r=1$, we obtain a spanning set that can be restricted to a basis in various ways. In the case $r&gt;2$, we obtain a basis of a well-behaved subspace of $S^{(d^r,1^{n-rd})}$, but not of the entire module.</description>

      <title>The minimum number of peeling sequences of a point set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in general position. We remove all of them one by one, in each step erasing one vertex of the convex hull of the current remaining set. Let $g_d(P)$ denote the number of different removal orders we can attain while erasing all points of $P$ this way, and let $g_d(n)$ be the \emph{minimum} of $g_d(P)$ over all $n$-element point sets $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Dumitrescu and T\'oth showed that $g_d(n)=(d+1)^{(d+1)^2n}$. We substantially improve their bound, by proving that $g_d(n)= O((d+d\ln{(d)})^{(2+\frac{(d-1)}{\lfloor d\ln{d}\rfloor})n})$. It follows that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exist sufficiently high dimensional point sets $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $g_d(P)\leq O(d^{(2+\epsilon)n})$. This almost closes the gap between the upper bound and the best-known lower bound $(d+1)^n$ for large values of $d$.</description>

      <title>The clique number of the exact distance $t$-power graph: complexity and eigenvalue bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact distance $t$-power of a graph $G$, $G^{[\sharp t]}$, is a graph which has the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices adjacent in $G^{[\sharp t]}$ if and only if they are at distance exactly $t$ in the original graph $G$. We study the clique number of this graph, also known as the $t$-equidistant number. We show that it is NP-hard to determine the $t$-equidistant number of a graph, and that in fact, it is NP-hard to approximate it within a constant factor. We also investigate how the $t$-equidistant number relates to another distance-based graph parameter; the $t$-independence number. In particular, we show how large the gap between both parameters can be. The hardness results motivate deriving eigenvalue bounds, which compare well against a known general bound. In addition, the tightness of the proposed eigenvalue bounds is studied.</description>

      <title>Recoloring via modular decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfiguration graph of the $k$-colorings of a graph $G$, denoted $R_{k}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colorings of $G$ and two colorings are adjacent in $R_{k}(G)$ if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. A graph $G$ is said to be recolorable if $R_{\ell}(G)$ is connected for all $\ell \geq \chi(G)$+1. We demonstrate how to use the modular decomposition of a graph class to prove that the graphs in the class are recolorable. In particular, we prove that every ($P_5$, diamond)-free graph, every ($P_5$, house, bull)-free graph, and every ($P_5$, $C_5$, co-fork)-free graph is recolorable.
  A graph is prime if it cannot be decomposed by modular decomposition except into single vertices. For a prime graph $H$, we study the complexity of deciding if $H$ is $k$-colorable and the complexity of deciding if there exists a path between two given $k$-colorings in $R_{k}(H)$. Suppose $\mathcal{G}$ is a hereditary class of graphs. We prove that if every blowup of every prime graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is recolorable, then every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is recolorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any convex geometry $\mathcal{A}=(U,\mathcal{C})$ on $n$ points and any ideal $\mathcal{I}=(U',\mathcal{C}')$ of $\mathcal{A}$ can be realized as the intersection pattern of an open convex polyhedral cone $K\subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ with the orthants of ${\mathbb R}^n$. Furthermore, we show that $K$ can be chosen to have at most $m$ facets, where $m$ is the number of critical rooted circuits of $\mathcal{A}$. We also show that any convex geometry of convex dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^d$ and that any multisimplicial complex (a basic example of an ideal of a convex geometry) of dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{2d}$ and that this is best possible. From our results it also follows that distributive lattices of dimension $d$ are realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{d}$ and that median systems are realizable. We leave open %the question whether each median system of dimension $d$ is realizable in ${\mathbb R}^{O(d)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we give several new upper and lower bounds on Ramsey numbers for books and wheels, including a tight upper bound establishing $R(W_5, W_7) = 15$, matching upper and lower bounds giving $R(W_5, W_9) = 18$, $R(B_2, B_8) = 21$, and $R(B_3, B_7) = 20$, and a number of additional tight lower bounds for books. We use a range of different methods: flag algebras, local search, bottom-up generation, and enumeration of polycirculant graphs.
  We also explore generalized Ramsey numbers using similar methods. Let $GR(r,K_s,t)$ denote the minimum number of vertices $n$ such that any $r$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $K_s$ with at most $t$ colors. We establish $GR(3,K_4,2) = 10, GR(4,K_4,3) = 10$, and some additional bounds.</description>

Abstract: We provide a formula for the Poincar\'e dual of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) cycle of a matroid in the Chow ring of the matroid. We derive the formula from the case of matroids realizable over the complex numbers and prove that it satisfies a contraction-deletion formula. From this fact, we prove it holds for all matroids, confirming a conjecture of Fife and Rinc\'on.</description>

      <title>Colouring the 1-skeleton of $d$-dimensional triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While every plane triangulation is colourable with three or four colours, Heawood showed that a plane triangulation is 3-colourable if and only if every vertex has even degree. In $d \geq 3$ dimensions, however, every $k \geq d+1$ may occur as the chromatic number of some triangulation of ${\mathbb S}^d$. As a first step, Joswig structurally characterised which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+1)$-colourable 1-skeleton. In the 20 years since Joswig's result, no characterisations have been found for any $k&gt;d+1$.
  In this paper, we structurally characterise which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+2)$-colourable 1-skeleton: they are precisely the triangulations that have a subdivision such that for every $(d-2)$-cell, the number of incident $(d-1)$-cells is divisible by three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every graph $G$ with a sufficiently large complete bipartite induced minor, either $G$ has an induced minor isomorphic to a large wall, or $G$ contains a large constellation; that is, a complete bipartite induced minor model such that on one side of the bipartition, each branch set is a singleton, and on the other side, each branch set induces a path.
  We further refine this theorem by characterizing the unavoidable induced subgraphs of large constellations as two types of highly structured constellations. These results will be key ingredients in several forthcoming papers of this series.</description>

      <title>Repeated Lefschetz-like decompositions for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes and gamma vectors of flag spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find decompositions of $h$-polynomials of flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex that yield a direct connection between gamma vectors of flag spheres and constructions used to build them geometrically. More specifically, they are determined by iterated double suspensions and a "net nonnegative set of edge subdivisions" taking it to the given flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex. By a "net nonnegative set of edge subdivision", we mean a collection of edge subdivisions and contractions where there are at least as many edge subdivisions as contractions.
  Returning to the flag spheres, these repeated decompositions involve links over collections of disjoint edges and give an analogue of a Lefschetz map that applies to each step of the decomposition. The constructions used also give a direct interpretation of the Boolean decompositions coming from links and those of the entire simplicial complex. Roughly speaking, the Boolean vs. non-Boolean distinction is used to measure how far a flag sphere is from being the boundary of a cross polytope. An analogue of this statement for flag doubly Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes would replace boundaries of cross polytopes by repeated suspensions of links over edges of the given simplicial complex.</description>

      <title>Richardson varieties, projected Richardson varieties and positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey article on Richardson varieties and their combinatorics. A Richardson variety is the intersection, inside the flag manifold GL_n/B_+, of a Schubert cell (B_- u B_+)/B_+ and an opposite Schubert cell (B_+ w B_+)/B_+ (or the similar intersection of Schubert varieties). In this survey, we provide an overview of what is known about (1) homogeneous coordinate rings of Richardson varieties, their bases and degenerations (2) parametrizations of Richardson varieties using Bott-Samelson varieties (3) Deodhar's decompositions of the flag manifold and of Richardson varieties within it and (4) total positivity in the flag manifold. We also provide an overview of the combinatorics of positroid varieties, their relations to Richardson varieties, and how they are parametrized using plabic graphs. Most of this survey is an overview of other authors' work over the last forty years, but there are also some minor original results: For example, that coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are UFD's (Corollary 3.23), that the Deodhar decomposition is not a stratification in Lie type A (Section 4.3) and explicit descriptions of the Deodhar decomposition in terms of ranks of submatrices (Section 4.4).</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>

      <title>Obstruction characterization of co-TT graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Threshold tolerance graphs and their complement graphs, known as co-TT graphs, were introduced by Monma, Reed, and Trotter[24]. Building on this, Hell et al.[19] introduced the concept of negative interval. Then they proceeded to define signedinterval digraphs/ bigraphs, demonstrating their equivalence to several seemingly distinct classes of digraphs/ bigraphs. They also showed that co-TT graphs are equivalent to symmetric signed-interval digraphs, where some vertices of the digraphs have loops and others do not. We have showed that this actually solve the representation characterization problem of co-TT graphs posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [24]. In this paper, we characterize signed-interval bigraphs and signed-interval graphs in terms of their biadjacency matrices and adjacency matrices, respectively. Moreover we emphasize on the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, i.e. co-TT graphs. Finally, by utilizing the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, we resolve the open problem of characterizing co-TT graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, a problem initially posed by Monma, Reed, and Trotter in the same paper.</description>

      <title>Dowker duality, profunctors, and spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intent of this paper is to explore Dowker duality from a combinatorial, topological, and categorical perspective. The paper presents three short, new proofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce modifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational join and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be constructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which includes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In this more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial complexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence. Similar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations of relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role of the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that arise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly, we show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$, and the cograph form a long exact sequence.</description>

      <title>Noisy Linear Group Testing: Exact Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>
