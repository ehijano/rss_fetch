      <title>Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of corrugated nanolaminate films as reflective light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving laser-driven, reflective, relativistic light sails would represent a tremendous breakthrough for humankind, allowing us to advance our understanding of the solar system and deep space far beyond what we know from space probes, telescopes, and objects passing near Earth. Numerous sail film designs have been proposed, but none have been demonstrated that satisfy all of the stringent optical, mechanical, and mass budget constraints. Here we overcome this challenge by experimentally demonstrating a novel class of optically-optimized nanolaminate sails with strong and flexible hexagonally-corrugated microstructures. Our prototypes, fabricated from alumina and molybdenum disulfide using scalable semiconductor processing techniques, feature ultra-low areal densities of &lt;1 g/m^2 and achieve experimentally-measured reflectivities of &gt;50% and absorptivities of &lt;4% within the Doppler-shifted laser wavelength range corresponding to accelerating to a fifth the speed of light. Moreover, we analyze reflectivity, strength, and mass constraints to show that our sails have the potential to achieve greater maximum velocities than other sail designs in the literature. Broadly, our films mark a significant leap forward toward plausible relativistic interstellar propulsion for intragalactic exploration</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith theory for perturbations at exceptional and diabolic point degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies, including diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points, exhibit unique sensitivity to external perturbations, enabling powerful control and engineering of wave phenomena. We present a residue-based perturbation theory that quantifies complex resonance splitting of DP and EP type spectral degeneracies using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We validate our theory using both analytic Hamiltonian models and numerical electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a range of cases. Our approach accurately predicts degenerate resonance splitting using only scattering data, offering a powerful framework for precision tuning, inverse design, and practical exploitation of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Impact of material properties on the spectral broadening process in thin solid media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The post-compression of high peak power laser pulses can efficiently increase the peak intensity on target without the need to build additional amplification stages and enlarge the compressor optics. However, to our best knowledge, the spectral broadening of such pulses with different nonlinear media has not yet been investigated systematically. Here we performed an experimental campaign with mJ-class 25 fs pulses, where the conditions of high energy post-compression were emulated. Fused silica, sapphire, and YAG plates were tested for spectral broadening and compressibility while measuring the spatio-spectral properties of the broadened pulses. We conducted a series of numerical simulations to have deeper insight on the broadening process, to better understand the experimental results and to find optimum parameters for future experiments.</description>

      <title>MetaDiT: Enabling Fine-grained Constraints in High-degree-of Freedom Metasurface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultrathin, engineered materials composed of nanostructures that manipulate light in ways unattainable by natural materials. Recent advances have leveraged computational optimization, machine learning, and deep learning to automate their design. However, existing approaches exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) they often restrict the model to generating only a subset of design parameters, and (2) they rely on heavily downsampled spectral targets, which compromises both the novelty and accuracy of the resulting structures. The core challenge lies in developing a generative model capable of exploring a large, unconstrained design space while precisely capturing the intricate physical relationships between material parameters and their high-resolution spectral responses. In this paper, we introduce MetaDiT, a novel framework for high-fidelity metasurface design that addresses these limitations. Our approach leverages a robust spectrum encoder pretrained with contrastive learning, providing strong conditional guidance to a Diffusion Transformer-based backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MetaDiT outperforms existing baselines in spectral accuracy, we further validate our method through extensive ablation studies. Our code and model weights will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-free terahertz nonreciprocity via temporal dissipative barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) nonreciprocal devices are essential for advancing future fundamental science, wireless communications, imaging, and sensing. Current THz nonreciprocal devices mostly rely on magnetic materials, which, however, suffer from large volume, operation under an external magnetic field, and low-temperature environment, rendering them poorly compatible with miniaturized developments. Here,we propose an unconventional method for achieving THz nonreciprocity free from magnetic materials. The scheme relies on a temporal dissipative barrier, a transient loss variation generated by photoexcited carriers, and the nonreciprocity arises from the distinct coupling behavior for different polarizations with the barrier. The isolation efficiency correlates with the temporal barrier width, resonant mode detuning, and the working frequency, and has been significantly enhanced by introducing a dark mode. We experimentally confirm our method in a THz optically active metasurface with wave-flow isolation exceeding 20 dB across a bandwidth greater than 0.4 THz. Theoretical predictions indicate peak isolation surpassing 60 dB, with experimental results achieving over 30 dB at 0.7 THz. Our approach unlocks the potential of miniaturized, integrated, magnetic-free THz nonreciprocal devices for various applications.</description>

      <title>Meta-Diastereomers Hierarchical Multiscale Chiral Interactions Between Biomolecules and Nanoscale Enantiomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce meta-diastereomers, hybrid systems where molecular chirality ($\leq 10$\,nm) and nanoscale chirality ($&gt;100$\,nm) combine to create a new hierarchical chiral state with emergent optical properties. By coupling chiral biomolecules electrostatically with enantiomeric silicon nanostructures, we demonstrate how distinct chiral systems can interact to produce optical responses -- linear and circular dichroism -- that reflect the combined chirality of both components. This unique interplay of chirality across scales represents a conceptual advance in chiral nanophotonics. Importantly, we leverage the meta-diastereomers to probe a model antibody-antigen interaction, analogous to how molecular diastereomers are used in chemistry to investigate chiral structures. This work establishes a platform for label-free, highly specific detection of biomolecular interactions and opens new avenues for exploring hierarchical chirality in optics, biosensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with optically active monolayers for nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an optically active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.</description>

      <title>Towards ultracompact photonic chips using higher-order modes in closely spaced waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are gaining traction in the field of telecommunications and information processing for their low-loss and high-throughput data transmission in comparison to electronic integrated circuits. However, they are still not used as widely as their electronic counterparts due to a relatively large footprint of photonic chips. One limiting factor to their size is the need to separate optical components by distances on the order of the working wavelength or larger to minimize optical crosstalk between them. In this work, we consider the fundamental and higher-order modes in closely spaced straight and bent waveguides with relatively small cross sections and find that higher-order modes allow one to substantially reduce the crosstalk in both cases. This can be used to considerably reduce the dimensions of photonic chips. We also propose on-chip components that allow selective excitation of higher-order modes. In addition, we design a directional coupler, a 3-dB splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer capable of operating on higher-order modes. Other ultracompact photonic-chip components, such as optical interconnects, switches, transceivers, and phased waveguide arrays for on-chip LiDAR scanners, can be designed as well based on similar principles.</description>

      <title>Polymer fiber mats provide white and full-color tunable lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Lasing has become highly advantageous for achieving white laser emission. Utilizing multiple light scattering in disordered media allows for cost-effective and flexible designs, as well as the seamless integration of multiple multicolor gain materials. However, generating light that closely meets the D65 illumination standard remains challenging due to energy transfer between chromophores. To address this issue, effective spatial separation of gain media is required. Here, we present a solution to the problem using hierarchically designed polymer fiber mats with spatially distributed red, green, and blue (RGB) laser dyes to achieve controlled and tunable multicolor and white lasing. While electrospun fibers are well-studied, their use for multicolor random lasing is demonstrated here for the first time. Our results demonstrate outstanding spectral tunability, aligning well with industrial color standards such as sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3. The white lasing closely matches D-series white illuminants, including D65, D55, and D75 standards, with coordinate deviations as low as approximately 0.2 to 3%, surpassing previously reported values for organic, hybrid, and inorganic systems. By limiting energy transfer, our approach enables precise lasing control, demonstrating that fiber mats are versatile for next-generation random lasing applications. These findings advance technologies in Li-Fi, laser displays, optical sensors, switches, and modulators, bringing tunable lasers closer to commercialization.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet laser generation at 118 nm via adaptive random additional periodic-phase engineering in a LiF crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coherent sources below 120nm are of paramount significance for promoting next-generation nano-scale lithography,precision spectroscopy, and exploring the emerging physical phenomena in quantum materials. Nonlinear optical conversion serves as the only feasible approach to obtain solid state EUV lasers, yet the intrinsic strong absorption at EUV and giant phase mismatch among light waves have hindered the realization of highly-efficient EUV light sources. Herein, we propose a random additional periodic phase (RAPP) strategy in third-order nonlinear crystals to overcome these problems, that an artificially designed random phase grating at micrometer-scales is embedded in the homogeneous bulk crystal, thus adaptively compensating the phase mismatch between fundamental-wave and third-harmonic waves. For the first time, the EUV laser at 118nm is demonstrated in the RAPP lithium fluoride (LiF) crystals with wide period distributions, where the highest output power is over 90uW. To the best our knowledge, this is the shortest wavelength among all solid-state laser systems, which represents a significant advance in nonlinear optical materials and opens new roadmap toward high-brightness EUV sources.</description>

      <title>3D DNA Origami-Enabled Molecularly Addressable Optical Nanocircuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical nanocircuit concept provides a predictive framework analogous to an electric RLC circuit, where induced dipoles in plasmonic nanoparticle (NPs), ohmic losses in NPs, and dielectric gaps serve as inductors (L), capacitors (C), and resistors (R), respectively. This modular theory allows unprecedented design flexibility, expanding the range of achievable optical resonances in plasmonic clusters. However, existing experimental approaches, such as atomic force microscope tip-enabled nanomanipulation and electron-beam lithography, lack the critical accuracy in nanogap tuning and molecular loading required for applications like PRET. Here, we introduce a molecularly addressable optical nanocircuit enabled by DNA origami. First, we theoretically and experimentally confirmed that gold (Au) NPs and dye-loaded DNA origami can function as different circuit elements: R- and C-coupled L and R-coupled C, respectively. To assemble large Au NPs into designer optical nanocircuits, we utilized a mechanically robust 3D DNA origami design rather than conventionally used 2D origami sheet. This platform provided high reproducibility and accuracy in assembling a range of structures-from dimers to tetramers-with controlled symmetry, heterogeneity, and nanogap tunability. Together with ultrasmoothness and uniformity of Au NPs, we achieved the highest Q-factor for magnetic resonance of a nanoparticle-based optical nanocircuit (~19.2). Also, selective molecular cargo loading onto designated 3D DNA origami sites within plasmonic clusters enabled deterministic, predictive light-molecule coupling in optical nanocircuits. This resulted in 100-fold stronger PRET signal in dimeric clusters compared to monomeric NPs. Our approach opens promising directions in designing custom optical resonances for use in molecular sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Vanadium Dioxide-Based Ultra-Broadband Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a VO2-based metamaterial absorber optimized for ultra-broadband, polarization-insensitive performance in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The absorber consists of a patterned VO2 metasurface, a low-loss MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. Exploiting the phase transition of VO2, the design enables dynamic control of electromagnetic absorption. Full-wave simulations show an average absorptance of 98.15% across a 5.38THz bandwidth (5.72-11.11THz) and over 99% absorption sustained across 3.35THz. The absorber maintains stable performance for varying polarization angles and both TE and TM modes under oblique incidence. Impedance analysis confirms strong matching to free space, reducing reflection and eliminating transmission. Parametric analysis investigates the influence of VO2 conductivity, MF2 thickness, and unit cell periodicity on performance. Compared to recent THz metamaterial absorbers, the proposed design achieves broader bandwidth, higher efficiency, and simpler implementation. These characteristics make it suitable for THz sensing, imaging, wireless communication, and adaptive photonic systems, and position it as a promising platform for tunable and reconfigurable THz modules.</description>

      <title>Observation of \sigma-\pi coupling and mode selection in optically trapped artificial polariton molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.</description>

      <title>FEL performance and tolerance studies of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB beamline AQUA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AQUA beamline of the EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB facility is a SASE free-electron laser designed to operate in the water window, in the 3-4 nm wavelength range. The electron beam driving this source is accelerated up to about 1-1.2 GeV by an X-band normal conducting linear accelerator, followed by a plasma wakefield acceleration stage. The main radiator consists of an array of ten APPLE-X permanent magnet undulator modules, each 2 m long and with a period length of 18 mm. Tolerance analyses against resistive wall wakefields and injection misalignments at undulator entrance are performed, and the related effects on the laser yield performance are evaluated and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum communication using superconducting qubits, emphasizing the simulation and control of quantum systems via IBM Brisbane quantum processor. We focus on implementing fundamental quantum gates and analyzing the evolution of entangled states, which are essential for secure and reliable information transfer. The study highlights the role of entanglement as a critical resource in quantum communication, enabling secure connectivity across quantum networks. Simulations incorporate realistic conditions, including decoherence and noise, to assess the practical viability of entangled state operations. Additionally, we explore the extension of these systems to simulate key quantum models such as the Jaynes Cummings and longitudinal Ising models, offering insight into complex interactions in superconducting architectures. The findings advance quantum information science by demonstrating the potential of superconducting qubit systems for both foundational research and real world applications in quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Material-Driven Optimization of Transmon Qubits for Scalable and Efficient Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most crucial steps in creating practical quantum computers is designing scalable and efficient superconducting qubits. Coherence times, connections between individual qubits, and reduction of environmental noise are critical factors in the success of these qubits. Because they can be lithographically fabricated and are less sensitive to charge noise, superconducting qubits, especially those based on the Transmon architecture, have emerged as top contenders for scalable platforms. In this work, we use a combination of design iteration, material analysis, and simulation to tackle the superconducting qubit optimization challenge. We created transmon-based layouts for 4 qubits and 8 qubits using Qiskit Metal and conducted an individual analysis for each qubit. We investigated anharmonicity and extracted eigenfrequencies, computing participation ratios across several design passes, and identifying the top five energy eigenstates using Ansys HFSS. We then created a 2D cross section of a single qubit design in COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate how different materials affect performance. This enables us to assign various superconducting materials and substrates and investigate their effects on energy loss and electromagnetic properties. Qubit coherence and overall device quality are significantly influenced by the materials chosen. This integrated framework of material based simulation and circuit design offers a workable way to create reliable superconducting qubit systems and supports continued attempts to create scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Model-based framework for automated quantification of error sources in quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality quantum state generation is essential for advanced quantum information processing, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum computing. In practice, various error sources degrade the quality of quantum states, and quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard diagnostic tool. However, in QST, multiple error sources gather in a single density matrix, making it difficult to identify individual error sources. To address this problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by combining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental density matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the density matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the parameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data. Optimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024, indicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors. Reducing the predicted error sources improves the state quality, consistent with our predictions and thus validating the proposed method. In addition, the modular structure of this framework makes it applicable to other quantum platforms, such as superconducting qubits, atoms, and solid-state spins.</description>

      <title>Helical dichroism for hybridized quadrupole plasmon modes in twisted nanorods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD), originating from the interplay between chiral plasmonic structures and left and right vortex light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted significant attention across various disciplines owing to its implications in fundamental physics and applications. However, the precise relationship between HD and the excited plasmon modes remains elusive. Owing to the weak chiroptical response to OAM light, chiral structures have required dimensions larger than the incident light wavelength to obtain observable HD signals, resulting in complex superpositions of higher-order plasmon modes. In this work, we reveal that a simple twisted nanorod dimer with a size smaller than the incident light wavelength, exhibits remarkable HD due to the strong coupling between quadrupole plasmon modes excited in the nanorods, followed by the plasmon hybridization. Positive and negative HD responses were measured at different resonance wavelengths corresponding to two hybridized quadrupole modes, in good agreement with the calculated results. This spectral behavior of the HD is clearly different from that of the circular dichroism (CD) based on spin angular momentum (SAM) of light, indicating that the quadrupole HD arises from the OAM rather than the SAM. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of light-matter interactions concerning angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A phase-modulation interferometer for intense, ultrashort, near infrared laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of coherent phenomena in strong-field processes requires interferometric measurement schemes with high selectivity to disentangle the complex nonlinear response of the system. Interferometers combining acousto-optical phase modulation with lock-in detection feature excellent dynamic range and highly selective detection, thus providing a promising solution. However, acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) cause several issues when operated with intense, ultrashort, near infrared (NIR) laser pulses. The AOMs introduce temporal and angular dispersion, self-phase modulation and reduced acousto-optic efficiency at NIR wavelengths. Here, we present an acousto-optical phase modulation interferometer design that solves these issues. The presented solutions pave the way for the investigation of strong-field processes with phasemodulated interferometry and are also useful to improve the performance of phase-modulation interferometers in other applications.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Optics as a Causal Time Series Mapping: A Generative Machine Learning Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of many-body quantum systems to an optical pulse can be extremely challenging to model. Here we explore the use of neural networks, both traditional and generative, to learn and thus simulate the response of such a system from data. The quantum system can be viewed as performing a complex mapping from an input time-series (the optical pulse) to an output time-series (the systems response) which is often also an optical pulse. Using both the transverse and non-integrable Ising models as examples, we show that not only can temporal convolutional networks capture the input/output mapping generated by the system but can also be used to characterize the complexity of the mapping. This measure of complexity is provided by the size of the smallest latent space that is able to accurately model the mapping. We further find that a generative model, in particular a variational auto-encoder, significantly outperforms traditional auto-encoders at learning the complex response of many-body quantum systems. For the example that generated the most complex mapping, the variational auto-encoder produces outputs that have less than 10% error for more than 90% of inputs across our test data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>
