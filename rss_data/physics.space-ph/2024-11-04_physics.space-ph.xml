      <title>Cross-Field Diffusion Effects on Particle Transport in a Solar Coronal Flux Rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key agents of space weather phenomena, posing severe threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) indicate that the magnetic flux ropes of a CME can trap energetic particles and act as barriers, preventing other particles from crossing. In this paper, we introduce the novel COCONUT+PARADISE model to investigate the confinement of energetic particles within a flux rope and the effects of cross-field diffusion (CFD) on particle transport in the solar corona, particularly in the presence of a CME. Using the global magnetohydrodynamic coronal model COCONUT, we generate background configurations containing a CME modeled as a Titov-D\'emoulin flux rope (TDFR). We then utilize the particle transport code PARADISE to inject monoenergetic 100 keV protons inside one of the TDFR legs near its footpoint and evolve the particles through the COCONUT backgrounds. To study CFD, we employ two different approaches regarding the perpendicular proton mean free path (MFP): a constant MFP and a Larmor radius-dependent MFP. We contrast these results with those obtained without CFD. While particles remain fully trapped within the TDFR without CFD, we find that even relatively small perpendicular MFP values allow particles on the outer layers to escape. In contrast, the initially interior trapped particles stay largely confined. Finally, we highlight how our model and this paper's results are relevant for future research on particle acceleration and transport in an extended domain encompassing both the corona and inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Effects of background solar wind and drag force on the propagation of coronal mass ejection driven shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propagation of interplanetary (IP) shocks, particularly those driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is still an outstanding question in heliophysics and space weather forecasting. Here we address effects of the ambient solar wind on the propagation of two similar CME-driven shocks from the Sun to Earth. The two shock events (CME03: April 3, 2010 and CME12: July 12, 2012) have the following properties: Both events (1) were driven by a halo CME (i.e., source location is near the Sun-Earth line), (2) had a CME source in the southern hemisphere, (3) had a similar transit time (~2 days) to Earth, (4) occurred in a non-quiet solar period, and (5) led to a severe geomagnetic storm. The initial (near the Sun) propagation speed, as measured by coronagraph images, was slower (by ~300 km/s) for CME03 than CME12, but it took about the same amount of traveling time for both events to reach Earth. According to the in-situ solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft, the CME03-driven shock was associated with a faster solar wind upstream of the shock than the CME12-driven shock. This is also demonstrated in our global MHD simulations. Analysis of our simulation result indicates that the drag force indirectly plays an important role in the shock propagation. The present study suggests that in addition to the initial CME propagation speed near the Sun the shock speed (in the inertial frame) and the ambient solar wind condition, in particular the solar wind speed, are the key to timing the arrival of CME-driven-shock events.</description>

      <title>Impact of High Intensity Long-Duration Continuous Auroral Electrojet Activity (HILDCAAs) on relativistic electrons of the radiation belt of Earth during Van Allen probe era</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of High-intensity Long-Duration Continuous Auroral Electrojet Activity (HILDCAA) on the relativistic electrons in radiation belt of Earth. Utilizing data from Van Allen Probe mission of NASA, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to understand the impact of HILDCAA events on the radiation belt fluxes. The super epoch analysis was carried out to determine the general response of L-shell, pitch angle, and energy-dependency of relativistic electrons to HILDCAAs. The analysis reveals a significant flux enhancement in the relativistic electron fluxes, predominantly occurring with a delay of 0 to 2 days following the onset of HILDCAA events. The general response indicates that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons reaches up to 6 MeV. Additionally, electrons with perpendicular pitch angles exhibit a significantly greater enhancement in flux and achieve higher maximum acceleration energies compared to those with parallel pitch angles. The observed time-delayed and pitch angle-dependent response related to the onset of HILDCAAs highlights the significant influence of wave-particle interactions, particularly in relation to ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in this context. This is further supported by ground-based magnetometers and in-situ magnetic field observations from the RBSP probe, which demonstrated enhanced power of ULF waves during HILDCAA events. The study strengthens our current understanding of radiation belt particle acceleration processes and has potential implications for satellite operations and other space-based technologies, both on Earth and in the magnetospheres of other planets.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal EUV Wavefronts: the Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding CMEs, and Connection with the CME-driven Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefront speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>
