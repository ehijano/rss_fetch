      <title>Orthosystoles and orthokissing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary, we study the orthosystole, i.e. the length of a shortest essential arc from the boundary to the boundary. We recover and extend work by Bavard completely characterizing the surfaces maximizing the orthosystole in the case of a single boundary component. For multiple boundary components, we construct surfaces with large orthosystole and show that their orthosystole grows, as the genus goes to infinity, at the same rate as Bavard's upper bound.</description>

      <title>Discrete harmonic maps between hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a topological cell decomposition of a closed surface equipped with edge weights, we consider the Dirichlet energy of any geodesic realization of the 1-skeleton graph to a hyperbolic surface. By minimizing the energy over all possible hyperbolic structures and over all realizations within a fixed homotopy class, one obtains a discrete harmonic map into an optimal hyperbolic surface. We characterize the extremum by showing that at the optimal hyperbolic structure, the discrete harmonic map and the edge weights are induced from a weighted Delaunay decomposition.</description>

      <title>Convex surfaces with prescribed induced metrics in anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $h$ be a smooth metric of curvature $K&lt;-1$ on $S$, and let $h_0$ be a hyperbolic metric on $S$. We show that there exists a unique quasifuchsian AdS spacetime with left metric isotopic to $h_0$, containing a past-convex Cauchy surface with induced metric isotopic to $h$.</description>

      <title>Embeddings and disjunction of Lagrangian pinwheels via rational blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the symplectic rational blow-up to study some Lagrangian pinwheels in symplectic rational manifolds. In particular, we determine which symplectic forms in the threefold blow-up of $\C P^2$ carry Lagrangian projective planes that can be made disjoint by a Hamiltonian isotopy. In addition, we show that such a disjunction is not possible in del Pezzo surfaces with Euler characteristic between $4$ and $7$. Finally, we determine which symplectic forms on $S^2\times S^2$ carry a Lagrangian $L_{3,1}$ pinwheel, answering a question of J. Evans.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone and Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a smooth manifold, we associate to any closed differential form a mapping cone algebra. The cohomology of this mapping cone algebra can vary with the de Rham cohomology class of the closed form. We present a novel Morse theoretical description for the mapping cone cohomology. Specifically, we introduce a Morse complex for the mapping cone algebra which is generated by pairs of critical points with the differential defined by gradient flows and an integration of the closed form over spaces of gradient flow lines. We prove that the cohomology of our cone Morse complex is isomorphic to the mapping cone cohomology and hence independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex. We also obtain sharp inequalities that bound the dimension of the mapping cone cohomology in terms of the number of Morse critical points and the properties of the specified closed form. Our results are widely applicable, especially for any manifold equipped with a geometric structure described by a closed differential form. We also obtain a bound on the difference between the number of Morse critical points and the Betti numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a map from the set of all knot types ${\mathcal K}$ to a set $X$. Let $\beta$ be a map from ${\mathcal K}$ to a set $Y$. We define the relation between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be the image of a map $(\alpha,\beta)$ from ${\mathcal K}$ to $X\times Y$ sending an element $K$ of ${\mathcal K}$ to $(\alpha(K),\beta(K))$. We determine the relations between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for certain $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such as crossing number, unknotting number, bridge number, braid index, genus and canonical genus.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a bordism version of Gromov's linearity conjecture over a large family of acyclic groups, for manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Every group embeds into one of these acyclic groups, and thus it follows that the conjecture is true if one allows to enlarge a given group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. In the PL case, our results hold without assuming bounded local geometry. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers. We also show that the minimum number of simplices in a PL triangulation of $(4k-1)$-manifolds with a fixed simple homotopy type is unbounded if the fundamental group has nontrivial torsion. The proof of our main results builds on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over the simplicial classifying spaces of groups.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Morse Theory and Witten Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>
