      <title>Learning with Incomplete Context: Linear Contextual Bandits with Pretrained Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to improve downstream learning.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.</description>

      <title>Kernel Treatment Effects with Adaptively Collected Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects (KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error. Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar effects.</description>

      <title>Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier (upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes, achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model. In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution, quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than parametric variational cut approaches.</description>

      <title>On some practical challenges of conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate the three challenges simultaneously.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Learning Dynamics of Quantized Models with Straight-Through Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Multiple Imputation for Tabular Q-Learning in Online RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.</description>

      <title>How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language - has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature, existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error, enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Distance Covariance for Random Forest: Error Bounds and an EHR Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF. Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning Is Provably Bayesian Inference: A Generalization Theory for Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness in One-Stage Learning-to-Defer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including $\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.</description>

      <title>PAC-Bayesian Bounds on Constrained f-Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences, and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Group Lasso Regularized Rank Regression with Data-Driven Parameter Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.</description>

      <title>Performance of Machine Learning Methods for Gravity Inversion: Successes and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable, and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis with geographic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features, exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121 datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility, while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.</description>

      <title>Coupled Data and Measurement Space Dynamics for Enhanced Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Component Reward Function with Policy Gradient for Automated Feature Selection with Dynamic Regularization and Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently re-emerge.</description>

      <title>A Generic Machine Learning Framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals. These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices, to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques. The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and countering drones.</description>

      <title>Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Imbalanced Classification: Diversity makes the difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity. First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our method encourages diversity in the generated samples.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Lifted Training and Inversion Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms. This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations, and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies, including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods. Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems, detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g., unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks. Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training, particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory for understanding when abstract representations emerge in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in task-optimized, feature-learning network models.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Non-Euclidean Gradient Descent: Muon and its Many Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework, we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Myopic Bayesian Decision Theory for Batch Active Learning with Partial Batch Label Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label. This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction (EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling (ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ADDAPT-ML/ParBaLS.</description>

      <title>Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges: (i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth $f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a \emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$. Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust learning.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record; second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.</description>

Abstract: This essay develops a parallel between the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory and the Stone--Weierstrass theorem: both can be viewed as assertions that tie the distinguishing power of a class of objects to their expressive power. We provide an elementary theorem connecting the relevant notions of "distinguishing power". We also discuss machine learning and data science contexts in which these theorems, and more generally the theme of links between distinguishing power and expressive power, appear. Finally, we discuss the same theme in the context of linguistics, where it appears as a foundational principle, and illustrate it with several examples.</description>

      <title>AutoGD: Automatic Learning Rate Selection for Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However, it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.</description>

      <title>Structured Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: a Bayesian Network Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE) paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator. We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets, we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>Clustering Result Re-guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering (CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix. A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously. On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.</description>

      <title>Homomorphic Mappings for Value-Preserving State Aggregation in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative evaluations against seven algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tight Robustness Certificates and Wasserstein Distributional Attacks for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates than existing methods.

      <title>Experience-Efficient Model-Free Deep Reinforcement Learning Using Pre-Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel, model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.</description>

      <title>What Makes Looped Transformers Perform Better Than Non-Recursive Ones (Provably)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</description>

      <title>Robust Exploratory Stopping under Ambiguity in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment. Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of ambiguity and exploration.</description>

      <title>Exploration-free Algorithms for Multi-group Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions. First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group inference.</description>

      <title>Does Weighting Improve Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used approach for top-N recommendation and collaborative filtering. When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix factorization for recommender systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds. Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Tradeoffs for Noiseless Linear Regression with Oblivious Contamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of noiseless linear regression under Gaussian covariates in the presence of additive oblivious contamination. Specifically, we are given i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $(x, y)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$ with $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}_d)$ and $y = x^\top \beta + z$, where $z$ is drawn independently of $x$ from an unknown distribution $E$. Moreover, $z$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}_E[z = 0] = \alpha&gt;0$. The goal is to accurately recover the regressor $\beta$ to small $\ell_2$-error. Ignoring computational considerations, this problem is known to be solvable using $O(d/\alpha)$ samples. On the other hand, the best known polynomial-time algorithms require $\Omega(d/\alpha^2)$ samples. Here we provide formal evidence that the quadratic dependence in $1/\alpha$ is inherent for efficient algorithms. Specifically, we show that any efficient Statistical Query algorithm for this task requires VSTAT complexity at least $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling (\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES} and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models. Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach for nonlinear contextual bandits.</description>

      <title>Discrete State Diffusion Models: A Sample Complexity Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Information Disclosure During Gradient Descent Using Gradient Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of (utility) testing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Redundancy as a Structural Information Principle for Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure) and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems, such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic world of communication and the finite world of learning.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.</description>

      <title>Blade: A Derivative-free Bayesian Inversion Method using Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free). Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors. Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems, including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Representation Efficiency of Barlow Twins: An Information-Geometric Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) has been successfully applied to many engineering design optimization problems, where the cost of high-fidelity simulations and experiments can be prohibitive. However, challenges remain for constrained optimization problems using the MFBO framework, particularly in efficiently identifying the feasible region defined by the constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) method with novel acquisition functions. Specifically, we design efficient acquisition functions that 1) have analytically closed-form expressions; 2) are straightforward to implement; and 3) do not require feasible initial samples, an important feature often missing in commonly used acquisition functions such as expected constrained improvement (ECI). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic test problems using different combinations of acquisition functions. Then, we apply the proposed method to a data-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design problem, and a high-current joint design problem using finite element simulations with computational contact mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We forecast the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes by systematically integrating three key principles: using high-dimensional data with appropriate regularization, adopting rigorous out-of-sample validation procedures, and incorporating nonlinearities. By exploiting the rich information embedded in a large set of macroeconomic and financial predictors, we produce accurate predictions of the entire profile of macroeconomic risk in real time. Our findings show that regularization via shrinkage is essential to control model complexity, while introducing nonlinearities yields limited improvements in predictive accuracy. Out-of-sample validation plays a critical role in selecting model architecture and preventing overfitting.</description>

      <title>A Black-Box Debiasing Framework for Conditional Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics and generative modeling. Consider the problem of sampling from the posterior distribution $P_{X|Y=y^*}$ for some observation $y^*$, where the likelihood $P_{Y|X}$ is known, and we are given $n$ i.i.d. samples $D=\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ drawn from an unknown prior distribution $\pi_X$. Suppose that $f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})$ is the distribution of a posterior sample generated by an algorithm (e.g. a conditional generative model or the Bayes rule) when $\hat{\pi}_{X^n}$ is the empirical distribution of the training data. Although averaging over the randomness of the training data $D$, we have $\mathbb{E}_D\left(\hat{\pi}_{X^n}\right)= \pi_X$, we do not have $\mathbb{E}_D\left\{f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})\right\}= f(\pi_X)$ due to the nonlinearity of $f$, leading to a bias. In this paper we propose a black-box debiasing scheme that improves the accuracy of such a naive plug-in approach. For any integer $k$ and under boundedness of the likelihood and smoothness of $f$, we generate samples $\hat{X}^{(1)},\dots,\hat{X}^{(k)}$ and weights $w_1,\dots,w_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^kw_iP_{\hat{X}^{(i)}}$ is a $k$-th order approximation of $f(\pi_X)$, where the generation process treats $f$ as a black-box. Our generation process achieves higher accuracy when averaged over the randomness of the training data, without degrading the variance, which can be interpreted as improving memorization without compromising generalization in generative models.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Generalization of Stochastic Gradient Adam in Learning Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning, which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD, stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$ tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting an effective step-size is a fundamental challenge in first-order optimization, especially for problems with non-Euclidean geometries. This paper presents a novel adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms that rely on linear minimization oracles, as used in the Conditional Gradient or non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms. Using a simple heuristic to estimate a local Lipschitz constant for the gradient, we can determine step-sizes that guarantee sufficient decrease at each iteration. More precisely, we establish convergence guarantees for our proposed Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which covers as special cases both the classical Conditional Gradient algorithm and non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms with adaptive step-sizes. Our analysis covers optimization of continuously differentiable functions in non-convex, quasar-convex, and strongly convex settings, achieving convergence rates that match state-of-the-art theoretical bounds. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical effectiveness of Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent. The results exhibit competitive performance, underscoring the potential of the adaptive step-size for applications.</description>

      <title>How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-DFL: Decision-focused Diffusion Models for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically, flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor. Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to integrate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems. In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments are further provided to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Upper and Lower Bounds for Optimistic Hedge in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known, both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m \log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly, these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Reinforced sequential Monte Carlo for amortised sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1506.01520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many leading classification algorithms output a classifier that is a weighted average of kernel evaluations. Optimizing these weights is a nontrivial problem that still attracts much research effort. Furthermore, explaining these methods to the uninitiated is a difficult task. Letting all the weights be equal leads to a conceptually simpler classification rule, one that requires little effort to motivate or explain, the mean. Here we explore the consistency, robustness and sparsification of this simple classification rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based deep generative method for learning conditional distributions, named Conditional F\"ollmer Flow. Starting from a standard Gaussian distribution, the proposed flow could approximate the target conditional distribution very well when the time is close to 1. For effective implementation, we discretize the flow with Euler's method where we estimate the velocity field nonparametrically using a deep neural network. Furthermore, we also establish the convergence result for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the distribution of the learned samples and the target conditional distribution, providing the first comprehensive end-to-end error analysis for conditional distribution learning via ODE flow. Our numerical experiments showcase its effectiveness across a range of scenarios, from standard nonparametric conditional density estimation problems to more intricate challenges involving image data, illustrating its superiority over various existing conditional density estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization. We illustrate the scope of the results on applications such as stochastic vehicle scheduling, highlighting how smoothing enables both tractable training and controlled generalization.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Optimal Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Learning Bayesian Networks from Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning Bayesian networks from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. We consider an $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for this problem which is known to have favorable statistical properties but is computationally challenging to solve, especially for medium-sized Bayesian networks. We propose a new coordinate descent algorithm to approximate this estimator and prove several remarkable properties of our procedure: the algorithm converges to a coordinate-wise minimum, and despite the non-convexity of the loss function, as the sample size tends to infinity, the objective value of the coordinate descent solution converges to the optimal objective value of the $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. Finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees are also established. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first coordinate descent procedure endowed with optimality and statistical guarantees in the context of learning Bayesian networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our coordinate descent method can obtain near-optimal solutions while being scalable.</description>

      <title>Mixing Times and Privacy Analysis for the Projected Langevin Algorithm under a Modulus of Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the projected Langevin algorithm (LA) and the privacy curve of noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), beyond nonexpansive iterations. Specifically, we derive new mixing time bounds for the projected LA which are, in some important cases, dimension-free and poly-logarithmic on the accuracy, closely matching the existing results in the smooth convex case. Additionally, we establish new upper bounds for the privacy curve of the subsampled noisy SGD algorithm. These bounds show a crucial dependency on the regularity of gradients, and are useful for a wide range of convex losses beyond the smooth case. Our analysis relies on a suitable extension of the Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) framework (Feldman et al., 2018; Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, 2023) to noisy iterations whose gradient map is not necessarily nonexpansive. This extension is achieved by designing an optimization problem which accounts for the best possible R\'enyi divergence bound obtained by an application of PABI, where the tractability of the problem is crucially related to the modulus of continuity of the associated gradient mapping. We show that, in several interesting cases -- namely the nonsmooth convex, weakly smooth and (strongly) dissipative -- such optimization problem can be solved exactly and explicitly, yielding the tightest possible PABI-based bounds.</description>

      <title>Any-stepsize Gradient Descent for Separable Data under Fenchel-Young Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient descent (GD) has been one of the most common optimizer in machine learning. In particular, the loss landscape of a neural network is typically sharpened during the initial phase of training, making the training dynamics hover on the edge of stability. This is beyond our standard understanding of GD convergence in the stable regime where arbitrarily chosen stepsize is sufficiently smaller than the edge of stability. Recently, Wu et al. (COLT2024) have showed that GD converges with arbitrary stepsize under linearly separable logistic regression. Although their analysis hinges on the self-bounding property of the logistic loss, which seems to be a cornerstone to establish a modified descent lemma, our pilot study shows that other loss functions without the self-bounding property can make GD converge with arbitrary stepsize. To further understand what property of a loss function matters in GD, we aim to show arbitrary-stepsize GD convergence for a general loss function based on the framework of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. We essentially leverage the classical perceptron argument to derive the convergence rate for achieving $\epsilon$-optimal loss, which is possible for a majority of Fenchel--Young losses. Among typical loss functions, the Tsallis entropy achieves the GD convergence rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and the R{\'e}nyi entropy achieves the far better rate $T=\Omega(\epsilon^{-1/3})$. We argue that these better rate is possible because of \emph{separation margin} of loss functions, instead of the self-bounding property.</description>

      <title>One-Stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer: Score-Based Surrogates with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both Bayes-consistent and $\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.</description>

      <title>When Less Is More: Binary Feedback Can Outperform Ordinal Comparisons in Ranking Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: The scientific process is a means to turn the results of experiments into knowledge about the world in which we live. Much research effort has been directed toward automating this process. To do this, one needs to formulate the scientific process in a precise mathematical language. This paper outlines one such language. What is presented here is hardly new. The material is based on great thinkers from times past well as more modern contributions. The novel contributions of this paper are: A new general data processing inequality, a bias variance decomposition for canonical losses, streamlined proofs of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein and Randomization theorems. means of calculating deficiency through linear programming.</description>

      <title>From Data to Rewards: a Bilevel Optimization Perspective on Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .</description>

      <title>Expert-Aided Causal Discovery of Ancestral Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) algorithms are notably brittle when data is scarce, inferring unreliable causal relations that may contradict expert knowledge, especially when considering latent confounders. Furthermore, the lack of uncertainty quantification in most CD methods hinders users from diagnosing and refining results. To address these issues, we introduce Ancestral GFlowNets (AGFNs). AGFN samples ancestral graphs (AGs) proportionally to a score-based belief distribution representing our epistemic uncertainty over the causal relationships. Building upon this distribution, we propose an elicitation framework for expert-driven assessment. This framework comprises an optimal experimental design to probe the expert and a scheme to incorporate the obtained feedback into AGFN. Our experiments show that: i) AGFN is competitive against other methods that address latent confounding on both synthetic and real-world datasets; and ii) our design for incorporating feedback from a (simulated) human expert or a Large Language Model (LLM) improves inference quality.</description>

      <title>Codiscovering graphical structure and functional relationships within data: A Gaussian Process framework for connecting the dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most problems within and beyond the scientific domain can be framed into one of the following three levels of complexity of function approximation. Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Online Auction Design Using Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification with Applications to E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online auction is a cornerstone of e-commerce, and a key challenge is designing incentive-compatible mechanisms that maximize expected revenue. Existing approaches often assume known bidder value distributions and fixed sets of bidders and items, but these assumptions rarely hold in real-world settings where bidder values are unknown, and the number of future participants is uncertain. In this paper, we introduce the Conformal Online Auction Design (COAD), a novel mechanism that maximizes revenue by quantifying uncertainty in bidder values without relying on known distributions. COAD incorporates both bidder and item features, using historical data to design an incentive-compatible mechanism for online auctions. Unlike traditional methods, COAD leverages distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques and integrates machine learning methods, such as random forests, kernel methods, and deep neural networks, to predict bidder values while ensuring revenue guarantees. Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices, based on the lower confidence bounds of bidder valuations, contrasting with the single reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of COAD through an application to real-world eBay auction data. Theoretical results and extensive simulation studies further validate the properties of our approach.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent estimation of generalized matrix factorization models with application to single-cell RNA sequencing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows the quantification of gene expression at the individual cell level, enabling the study of cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics. Dimensionality reduction is a common preprocessing step critical for the visualization, clustering, and phenotypic characterization of samples. This step, often performed using principal component analysis or closely related methods, is challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. In this work, we present a generalized matrix factorization model assuming a general exponential dispersion family distribution and we show that many of the proposed approaches in the single-cell dimensionality reduction literature can be seen as special cases of this model. Furthermore, we propose a scalable adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm that allows us to estimate the model efficiently, enabling the analysis of millions of cells. We benchmark the proposed algorithm through extensive numerical experiments against state-of-the-art methods and showcase its use in real-world biological applications. The proposed method systematically outperforms existing methods of both generalized and non-negative matrix factorization, demonstrating faster execution times and parsimonious memory usage, while maintaining, or even enhancing, matrix reconstruction fidelity and accuracy in biological signal extraction. On real data, we show that our method scales seamlessly to millions of cells, enabling dimensionality reduction in large single-cell datasets. Finally, all the methods discussed here are implemented in an efficient open-source R package, sgdGMF, available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Search Space for Conditional Causal Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal knowledge can be used to support decision-making problems. This has been recognized in the causal bandits literature, where a causal (multi-armed) bandit is characterized by a causal graphical model and a target variable. The arms are then interventions on the causal model, and rewards are samples of the target variable. Causal bandits were originally studied with a focus on hard interventions. We focus instead on cases where the arms are conditional interventions, which more accurately model many real-world decision-making problems by allowing the value of the intervened variable to be chosen based on the observed values of other variables. This paper presents a graphical characterization of the minimal set of nodes guaranteed to contain the optimal conditional intervention, which maximizes the expected reward. We then propose an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(|V| + |E|)$ to identify this minimal set of nodes. We prove that the graphical characterization and the proposed algorithm are correct. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm significantly prunes the search space and substantially accelerates convergence rates when integrated into standard multi-armed bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>On Different Notions of Redundancy in Conditional-Independence-Based Discovery of Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional-independence-based discovery uses statistical tests to identify a graphical model that represents the independence structure of variables in a dataset. These tests, however, can be unreliable, and algorithms are sensitive to errors and violated assumptions. Often, there are tests that were not used in the construction of the graph. In this work, we show that these redundant tests have the potential to detect or sometimes correct errors in the learned model. But we further show that not all tests contain this additional information and that such redundant tests have to be applied with care. Precisely, we argue that the conditional (in)dependence statements that hold for every probability distribution are unlikely to detect and correct errors - in contrast to those that follow only from graphical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Clustering by Nonparametric Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the clustering problem is introduced in which the task is expressed as an estimation problem, where the object to be estimated is a function which maps a point to its distribution of cluster membership. Unlike existing approaches which implicitly estimate such a function, like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), the proposed approach bypasses any explicit modelling assumptions and exploits the flexible estimation potential of nonparametric smoothing. An intuitive approach for selecting the tuning parameters governing estimation is provided, which allows the proposed method to automatically determine both an appropriate level of flexibility and also the number of clusters to extract from a given data set. Experiments on a large collection of publicly available data sets are used to document the strong performance of the proposed approach, in comparison with relevant benchmarks from the literature. R code to implement the proposed approach is available from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/CNS</description>

      <title>"Over-optimizing" for Normality: Budget-constrained Uncertainty Quantification for Contextual Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study uncertainty quantification for contextual stochastic optimization, focusing on weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), which uses machine-learned relevance weights based on covariates. Although wSAA is widely used for contextual decisions, its uncertainty quantification remains limited. In addition, computational budgets tie sample size to optimization accuracy, creating a coupling that standard analyses often ignore. We establish central limit theorems for wSAA and construct asymptotic-normality-based confidence intervals for optimal conditional expected costs. We analyze the statistical--computational tradeoff under a computational budget, characterizing how to allocate resources between sample size and optimization iterations to balance statistical and optimization errors. These allocation rules depend on structural parameters of the objective; misspecifying them can break the asymptotic optimality of the wSAA estimator. We show that ``over-optimizing'' (running more iterations than the nominal rule) mitigates this misspecification and preserves asymptotic normality, at the expense of a slight slowdown in the convergence rate of the budget-constrained estimator. The common intuition that ``more data is better'' can fail under computational constraints: increasing the sample size may worsen statistical inference by forcing fewer algorithm iterations and larger optimization error. Our framework provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty for contextual decision-making under computational constraints. It offers practical guidance on allocating limited resources between data acquisition and optimization effort, clarifying when to prioritize additional optimization iterations over more data to ensure valid confidence intervals for conditional performance.</description>

      <title>Supervised Manifold Learning for Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification is a core topic in functional data analysis. A large number of functional classifiers have been proposed in the literature, most of which are based on functional principal component analysis or functional regression. In contrast, we investigate this topic from the perspective of manifold learning. It is assumed that functional data lie on an unknown low-dimensional manifold, and we expect that superior classifiers can be developed based on the manifold structure. To this end, we propose a novel proximity measure that takes the label information into account to learn the low-dimensional representations, also known as the supervised manifold learning outcomes. When the outcomes are coupled with multivariate classifiers, the procedure induces a new family of functional classifiers. In theory, we prove that our functional classifier induced by the $k$-NN classifier is asymptotically optimal. In practice, we show that our method, coupled with several classical multivariate classifiers, achieves highly competitive classification performance compared to existing functional classifiers across both synthetic and real data examples. Supplementary materials are available online.</description>

      <title>Why Ask One When You Can Ask $k$? Learning-to-Defer to the Top-$k$ Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12988v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Learning-to-Defer (L2D) frameworks are limited to single-expert deferral, forcing each query to rely on only one expert and preventing the use of collective expertise. We introduce the first framework for Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, which allocates queries to the $k$ most cost-effective entities. Our formulation unifies and strictly generalizes prior approaches, including the one-stage and two-stage regimes, selective prediction, and classical cascades. In particular, it recovers the usual Top-1 deferral rule as a special case while enabling principled collaboration with multiple experts when $k&gt;1$. We further propose Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive variant that learns the optimal number of experts per query based on input difficulty, expert quality, and consultation cost. To enable practical learning, we develop a novel surrogate loss that is Bayes-consistent, $\mathcal{H}_h$-consistent in the one-stage setting, and $(\mathcal{H}_r,\mathcal{H}_g)$-consistent in the two-stage setting. Crucially, this surrogate is independent of $k$, allowing a single policy to be learned once and deployed flexibly across $k$. Experiments across both regimes show that Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ deliver superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, opening a new direction for multi-expert deferral in L2D.</description>

      <title>An Effective Gram Matrix Characterizes Generalization in Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the generalization gap accumulates slowly along the direction of training, charactering a benign training process. We provide novel perspectives for explaining the generalization ability of neural network training with different datasets and architectures through the alignment pattern of the ``residual" and the ``effective Gram matrix".</description>

      <title>Simple and Effective Specialized Representations for Fair Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

      <title>Coefficient Shape Transfer Learning for Functional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shapes of functions provide highly interpretable summaries of their trajectories. This article develops a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the challenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology incorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from auxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape from the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based transfer learning framework enhances robustness and generalizability: by being invariant to covariate scaling and signal strength, it ensures reliable knowledge transfer even when data from different sources differ in magnitude, and by formalizing the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity, it extends beyond traditional coefficient-equality assumptions to incorporate information from a broader range of source domains. We rigorously analyze the convergence rates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our findings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity of coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on coefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional covariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of auxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a data-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using physical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</description>

      <title>On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of a Single Global Merging in Decentralized Learning</title>

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication should be scheduled over time to improve global generalization, including determining when and how frequently devices synchronize. Counterintuitive empirical results show that concentrating communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training remarkably improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, can significant improve the generalization performance of decentralized learning under serve high data heterogeneity. Our theoretical contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the globally merged model of decentralized SGD can match the convergence rate of parallel SGD. Technically, we reinterpret part of the discrepancy among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as constructive components essential for matching this rate. This work provides promising results that decentralized learning is able to generalize under high data heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering broad new avenues for model merging research. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximate Posterior Sampling with Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>On Surjectivity of Neural Networks: Can you elicit any behavior from your model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Multitype Protected Attributes: Intersectional Fairness through Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however, methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called "fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength, including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset.</description>

      <title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RainfallBench-A710.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.</description>
