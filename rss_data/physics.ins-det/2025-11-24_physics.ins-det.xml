      <title>Electromagnetic transients and failed upward leaders observed during lightning activity in an onshore wind farm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At a wind farm in Croatia, lightning activity is monitored across the entire site using a lightning location system, and on a single wind turbine equipped with a Rogowski-coil-based current measurement system and a high-speed camera, all independently GPS-synchronized. In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine. Failed upward connecting leaders were observed in some of these cases. This paper provides observational analysis, providing Rogowski measurements of electromagnetic disturbances and failed leader currents, complemented by high-speed camera and lightning location system data.</description>

      <title>From Commissioning to Precision Data-Taking: Resolving Operational Challenges in the Nab Detector Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the weak mixing of quarks, described by the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix, currently presents an anomaly. Thanks to major strides in both theory and experiment, improved precision in determinations of the first row of matrix elements has revealed disagreement with the expectation of unitarity. The Nab experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source is designed to precisely extract the first matrix element $V_{ud}$ and shed light on experimental tensions within the neutron beta decay dataset. Nab's asymmetric spectrometer allows coincident reconstruction of the decay proton and electron energies, which will be used to determine the electron-neutrino correlation coefficient, and thus (with the neutron lifetime) determine $V_{ud}$. This unique approach has provided a more comprehensive view of neutron beta decay, including a first observation of the full momentum phase space of the decay above detector thresholds and limits on exotic neutron states. Recent upgrades to the Nab detector system have improved the robustness and stability of the detector performance in terms of proton detection efficiency, noise performance, and detector segment availability, setting the stage for high precision physics data-taking.</description>

      <title>On the Measurability of True Coincidence Summing in Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the summing correction formalism of Semkow et.al 1990 into the Semkow Gamma Formalism and extend it into a multiplicity expansion. We use this formalism to calculate the matrix probabilities for 180 degree coincidence events as a method for correcting coincidence summing, and show the deviation between the full correction and this correction as a function of multiplicity. We further extend this to the Partitioned Gamma Formalism, to calculate probabilities for gated gamma rays; where two gammas of interest are taken in multi-detector coincidence. We look at the summing correction that is involved in the gated gammas and calculate deviations in a manner similar to that done to the singles. We define terms such as measurability and ontic and epistemic events and show that within our definitions, coincidence summing is not sufficiently measurable, or rather, its sufficient measurability is statistically bounded by the deviations we derive. </description>

      <title>PlatonSPAD: A novel SPAD sensor for large-scale high-resolution particle detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution 3D tracking with sub-nanosecond timing is required for the detection of elementary particles, such as neutrinos. Conventional detectors, which utilize analog silicon photomultipliers, face challenges in balancing spatial resolution and scalability. To address this issue, a CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-based high-resolution particle detector is being developed. This work presents a study on SPAD layout optimization and a 4x4 SPAD macropixel module, fabricated in 110 nm CIS technology. Measurement results confirm that high-fill-factor designs improve photon detection efficiency without significant noise degradation. Furthermore, event-driven photon mapping and time stamping, enabled by time-to-digital converters and dedicated pixel circuits integrated into the 4x4 SPAD macropixel, were successfully demonstrated. This work is an essential step towards a sensor that detects probabilistic particle interactions and it lays the groundwork for the development of future large-scale SPAD-based particle detectors.</description>

      <title>A compact, easy-to-use leak detector for vacuum systems based on the MQ-8 sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a compact leak detector for vacuum systems that operates using hydrogen as a tracer gas, detected by a semiconductor MQ-8 sensor. The sensor is connected to an Arduino microcontroller, enabling digital signal processing and real-time visualization through the Processing software environment. The designed device is capable of detecting even small hydrogen leaks caused by imperfect sealing of vacuum connections. It is characterized by simplicity, low manufacturing cost, and suitability for laboratory use as an alternative to helium leak detectors. Experimental tests confirmed the effectiveness and stability of the developed leak detector during long-term measurements.</description>

      <title>Regularized Unfolding of gamma-ray Spectra for Nuclear Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing gamma-ray spectra from detector measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard methods, such as Folding Iteration with Compton Subtraction (FICS), provide point estimates but lack calibrated uncertainties and may bias the spectrum. We introduce an unfolding framework based on regularized maximum-likelihood estimation (RMLE) that enforces non-negativity and detector-response constraints while explicitly modeling background and contaminant contributions. Simulations and analytical results show that RMLE yields smoother reconstructions with well-calibrated confidence intervals and outperforms existing techniques for low-complexity spectra. Although high-complexity data remain challenging, the intervals produced by RMLE maintain correct coverage.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of the miniBELEN neutron counter for the study of $(\alpha,n)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniBELEN detector is a moderated neutron counter based on the use of $^3$He tubes and high-density polyethylene as moderator. The detector has been designed to have a neutron detection efficiency that is nearly independent from the initial neutron energy for ($\alpha$,n) reactions with alpha-particle energies up to 15 MeV. In order to achieve that, an innovative design methodology based on the use of cadmium neutron filters has been used. Monte Carlo calculations of the detector response have been validated using a $^{252}$Cf fission source. Measurements of the relatively well-known ($\alpha$,n) thick-target yields on aluminum have been found to be consistent with data from previous works. A method has been developed to correlate the counting rate ring ratios with the mean neutron energy and validated using previous time-of-flight measurements of the aluminum ($\alpha$,n) spectra and with a $^{252}$Cf fission source.

      <title>Radiation Effects on Stepper Motors and Lubricants: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of electrical motors and other remote systems are important tools in radiation environments. Certain harsh radiation environments, such as particle accelerators, require the use of remote systems during operation. Stepper motors are one motor, in particular, that have acquired interest in the nuclear field for use in these remote systems. The stepper motor's precision in rotation and holding is a highly desired quality. In this review, the stepper motor is examined for use in radiation environments. The different mechanical parts are introduced and examined from the broader literature of previous work. We attempt to explain the different radiation destructive mechanisms involved with each part of the stepper motor and how the mechanics are affected. Current and past research is explored, identifying either radiation hard alternatives or thresholds of the materials involved, and a general review of stepper motor radiation effects as available in literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four ultra-low background germanium spectrometers, called GeTHU, have been installed at the first phase of China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL-I), and served for material screening of dark matter and neutrino experiments. Recently, a new multi-detector spectrometer with five germanium detectors has been developed and installed at the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a minimum detectable activity (MDA) of about 10 {\mu}Bq/kg. In addition, another fifteen GeTHU-like spectrometers have been installed at CJPL-II with an MDA of about 1 mBq/kg. This paper will introduce the ultra-low background germanium spectrometers including shielding design, background characteristics and application to material screening.</description>

      <title>Improvements of the GPU Processing Framework for ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALICE is the dedicated heavy ion experiment at the LHC at CERN and records lead-lead collisions at a rate of up to 50 kHz. The detector with the highest data rate of up to 3.4 TB/s is the TPC. ALICE performs the full online TPC processing corresponding to more than 95\% of the total workload on GPUs, and when there is no beam in the LHC, the online computing farm's GPUs are used to speed up the offline processing. After the deployment of the first version of the online TPC processing needed for data taking, ALICE has implemented many improvements to its GPU processing framework. These include a run time compilation mode applying on the fly optimizations, improvements to parallelize / speed up the GPU compilation, debugging modes to guarantee reproducible and deterministic results in concurrent reconstruction, and framework features to leverage common components in the code of different detectors. The proceedings give an overview of the ALICE experience with GPUs in online and offline processing and present the latest GPU processing framework features.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Fiber Sensing for Research Campuses and Large Scientific Infrastructures -- The Hamburg WAVE proto-network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter upgraded readout electronics, developed for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC, is discussed. Data collected in two beam test campaigns conducted in 2018 and 2021 at the H4 and H2 beam lines of the CERN SPS are analyzed. Time and energy resolutions are measured on a $5\times 5$ matrix of lead tungstate crystals equipped with prototypes of the new front end readout electronics, using electron and pion beams of energies spanning from 25 to 250 GeV. In both campaigns the constant term of the energy resolution is measured to be better than 0.6% and the time resolution for electrons with energies above 50 GeV is measured to be better than 30 ps, fulfilling the design requirements.</description>

      <title>First operation of poly(ethylene naphthalate) enclosures for high-purity germanium detectors in liquid argon for $^{42}$K/$^{42}$Ar mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial argon contains cosmogenic $^{42}$Ar whose progeny $^{42}$K is a critical background component for the Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless $\beta \beta$ Decay (LEGEND). LEGEND operates High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors bare in liquid argon. $^{42}$K is attracted by the HPGe detectors' electric fields, and drifts toward the germanium surface, where it undergoes beta decay. LEGEND-1000 will mitigate $^{42}$K-induced background by using underground-sourced argon, depleted in cosmogenic isotopes. If underground argon is not available, mitigation techniques must be employed. Poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) enclosures were proposed to hinder the ion drift, decrease the beta-particle's energy, and produce scintillation light. In this paper, we report on operating two HPGe detectors, both bare and PEN-enclosed, in $^{42}$Ar-enriched liquid argon, and find no evidence for deterioration of energy stability or resolution due to the enclosures. We monitor the beta and gamma rates of $^{42}$K, find complex time-dependencies extending to roughly 30 days after applying the HPGe detectors' high-voltage, and qualitatively demonstrate the $^{42}$K suppression capabilities of enclosures.</description>

Abstract: Robust matching of side-scan sonar imagery remains a fundamental challenge in seafloor mapping due to view-dependent backscatter, shadows, and geometric distortion. This paper proposes a novel matching framework that combines physical decoupling and geometric consistency to enhance correspondence accuracy and consistency across viewpoints. A multi-branch network, derived from the Lambertian reflection model, decomposes raw sonar images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. The reflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction with a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA-LightGlue. Geometry-aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation and its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in acoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby improving registration accuracy. Quantitative and visual evaluations against traditional, CNN-, and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our method achieves lower matching error, higher geometric consistency, and greater robustness to viewpoint variations. The proposed approach provides a data-efficient, physically interpretable solution for high-precision side-scan sonar image matching in complex seafloor environments.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the first wafer-scale prototype for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade: the monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS)</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Performance of FBK VUV-HD3 and HPK VUV4 SiPMs in the LoLX Liquid Xenon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a critical technology for the next generation of rare-event search experiments using liquid xenon (LXe). While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of the Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is designed to utilize a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer, a positron transport system, and a positron detection system, to either discover or constrain this rare process with a conversion probability of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. This article presents an overview of the theoretical framework as well as a detailed description of the experimental design for the search for muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.</description>
