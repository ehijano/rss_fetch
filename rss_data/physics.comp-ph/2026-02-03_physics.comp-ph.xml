      <title>An Oscillation-Free Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative Finite Volume Method for Transcritical and Phase-Change Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative (RFQC) finite volume method is developed to address the numerical simulation of real fluids involving shock waves in transcritical and phase-change flows. To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic five-equation quasi-conservative model, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Gr\"uneisen coefficient $\Gamma$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $\Gamma$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error of the RFQC method is a high-order term relative to the spatial reconstruction truncation error. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff scheme is developed for electron-phonon coupling process in metals based on the two-temperature kinetic equations. The core of this method is to integrate the evolution information of physical equations into the numerical modeling process, which leads to that the time step or cell size is not limited by the relaxation time and mean free path. Specifically, the finite difference method is used to solve the kinetic model again when reconstructing the interfacial distribution function, through which the particle migration, scattering and electron-phonon coupling processes are coupled together within a single time step. Numerical tests demonstrate that this method could efficiently capture electron-phonon coupling or heat conduction processes from the ballistic to diffusive regimes. It provides a new tool for describing electron-phonon coupling or thermal management in microelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>aurel: A Python package for automatic relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \texttt{aurel} is an open-source Python package designed to \emph{au}tomatically calculate \emph{rel}ativistic quantities. It uses an efficient, flexible and user-friendly caching and dependency-tracking system, ideal for managing the highly nonlinear nature of general relativity. The package supports both symbolic and numerical calculations. The symbolic part extends \texttt{SymPy} with additional tensorial calculations. The numerical part computes a wide range of tensorial quantities, such as curvature, matter kinematics and much more, directly from any spacetime and matter data arrays using finite-difference methods. Inputs can be either generated from analytical expressions or imported from Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, with helper functions provided to read in data from standard NR codes. Given the increasing use of NR, \texttt{aurel} offers a timely post-processing tool to support the popularisation of this field.</description>

      <title>Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of subgrid scales in long-term simulations of the shallow-water equations using machine learning and convex limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for parametrizing sub-grid processes in the Shallow Water equations. We define coarse variables and local spatial averages and use a feed-forward neural network to learn sub-grid fluxes. Our method results in a local parametrization that uses a four-point computational stencil, which has several advantages over globally coupled parametrizations. We demonstrate numerically that our method improves energy balance in long-term turbulent simulations and also accurately reproduces individual solutions. The neural network parametrization can be easily combined with flux limiting to reduce oscillations near shocks. More importantly, our method provides reliable parametrizations, even in dynamical regimes that are not included in the training data.</description>

      <title>From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00643v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's "dataflow" paradigm, in which wires represent data and nodes represent operations, to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated by constructing and visualizing fundamental quantum algorithms and verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating "Block Diagrams" directly into quantum state evolutions ("Bloch Spheres"), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and Adaptive Residual Learning for Efficient Solution of Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into neural network training. However, solving high-fidelity PDEs remains computationally prohibitive, particularly for parametric systems requiring multiple evaluations across varying parameter configurations. This paper presents MF-BPINN, a novel multi-fidelity framework that synergistically combines physics-informed neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and adaptive residual learning. Our approach leverages abundant low-fidelity simulations alongside sparse high-fidelity data through a hierarchical neural architecture that learns nonlinear correlations across fidelity levels. We introduce an adaptive residual network with learnable gating mechanisms that dynamically balances linear and nonlinear fidelity discrepancies. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous Bayesian framework employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Methods for non-variational heuristic quantum optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimisation plays a central role in a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, and quantum computing has been widely proposed as a means to achieve computational advantages in this domain. To date, research into the design of noise-resilient quantum algorithms has been dominated by variational approaches, while alternatives remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel class of quantum optimisation heuristics that forgo this variational framework in favour of a hybrid quantum-classical approach built upon Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We introduce Quantum-enhanced Simulated Annealing (QeSA) and Quantum-enhanced Parallel Tempering (QePT), before validating these heuristics on hard Sherrington-Kirkpatrick instances and demonstrate their superior scaling over classical benchmarks. These algorithms are expected to exhibit inherent robustness to noise and support parallel execution across both quantum and classical resources with only classical communication required. As such, they offer a scalable and potentially competitive route toward solving large-scale optimisation problems with near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Phase Dynamics of Self-Accelerating Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-accelerating Airy matter waves offer a clean setting to access the cubic Kennard phase. Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Geometric-Volume Conservation in Cahn--Hilliard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard phase-field models provide a robust approximation of surface-diffusion-driven interface motion without explicit front tracking. In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\phi$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\phi)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.</description>

      <title>Multigrid Poisson Solver for Complex Geometries Using Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical method, inspired by transformation optics, for solving the Poisson equation in complex and arbitrarily shaped geometries. The approach operates by mapping the physical domain to a uniform computational domain through coordinate transformations, which can be applied either to the entire domain or selectively to specific boundaries inside the domain. This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid.</description>

      <title>Internal Trajectories and Observation Effects in Langevin Splitting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin integrators based on operator splitting are widely used in molecular dynamics. This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects.</description>

      <title>A Flux-Correction Form of the Third-Order Edge-Based Scheme for a General Numerical Flux Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a flux-correction form of the third-order edge-based scheme for the Euler equations that enables the direct use of a general flux function. The core idea is to replace, without loss of accuracy, the arithmetic average of the flux extrapolations by a general numerical flux evaluated at the edge midpoint, together with a correction term. We show that the proposed flux-correction form preserves third-order accuracy, provided that the general numerical flux is evaluated with the left and right states that are computed exactly for a quadratic function, which can be achieved effectively by the U-MUSCL scheme with {\kappa} = 1/2. Numerical results are presented to verify third-order accuracy with the HLLC and LDFSS flux functions on irregular tetrahedral grids.</description>

      <title>FluxNet: Learning Capacity-Constrained Local Transport Operators for Conservative and Bounded PDE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.</description>

In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Sampling two-dimensional isometric tensor network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling a quantum systems underlying probability distributions is an important computational task, e.g., for quantum advantage experiments and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.</description>

      <title>EquiNO: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator for Multiscale Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale problems are ubiquitous in physics. Numerical simulations of such problems by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at high resolution are computationally too expensive for many-query scenarios, such as uncertainty quantification, remeshing applications, and topology optimization. This limitation has motivated the development of data-driven surrogate models, where microscale computations are substituted by black-box mappings between macroscale quantities. While these approaches offer significant speedups, they typically struggle to incorporate microscale physical constraints, such as the balance of linear momentum. In this contribution, we propose the Equilibrium Neural Operator (EquiNO), a physics-informed PDE surrogate in which equilibrium is hard-enforced by construction. EquiNO achieves this by projecting the solution onto a set of divergence-free basis functions obtained via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), thereby ensuring satisfaction of equilibrium without relying on penalty terms or multi-objective loss functions. We compare EquiNO with variational physics-informed neural and operator networks that enforce physical constraints only weakly through the loss function, as well as with purely data-driven operator-learning baselines. Our framework, applicable to multiscale FE$^{\,2}$ computations, introduces a finite element-operator learning (FE-OL) approach that integrates the finite element (FE) method with operator learning (OL). We apply the proposed methodology to quasi-static problems in solid mechanics and demonstrate that FE-OL yields accurate solutions even when trained on restricted datasets. The results show that EquiNO achieves speedup factors exceeding 8000-fold compared to traditional methods and offers a robust and physically consistent alternative to existing data-driven surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Deriving effective electrode-ion interactions from free-energy profiles at electrochemical interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that -- without due care -- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical objectivity through the redundant encoding of pointer information in environmental fragments. However, existing diagnostics rely on arbitrary thresholds or structural assumptions that limit their operational applicability. We develop a framework based on \emph{functional information}, $\FI(\delta) = \log_2 R_\delta$, which quantifies objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that individually carry at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of classically accessible pointer information, as bounded by the Holevo quantity. Using onset statistics rather than parametric fits, we extract redundancy $R_\delta$ from the fragment size at which adequacy becomes typical. Simulations of a heterogeneous pure-dephasing model reveal three robust features: rapid early-time growth of $\ln R_\delta$, smooth crossover to saturation, and capacity-limited plateaus at $\FI^{\mathrm{plateau}} \lesssim \log_2 N$. We establish thermodynamic constraints showing that each additional bit of $\FI$ doubles the minimal heat dissipation required for record stabilization. These results frame classical objectivity as a quantifiable, resource-limited phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>

Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</description>

Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>
