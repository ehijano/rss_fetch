      <title>Multimodal Unlearnable Examples: Protecting Data against Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) has shown remarkable advances in zero-shot classification by learning from millions of image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. However, this reliance poses privacy risks, as hackers may unauthorizedly exploit image-text data for model training, potentially including personal and privacy-sensitive information. Recent works propose generating unlearnable examples by adding imperceptible perturbations to training images to build shortcuts for protection. However, they are designed for unimodal classification, which remains largely unexplored in MCL. We first explore this context by evaluating the performance of existing methods on image-caption pairs, and they do not generalize effectively to multimodal data and exhibit limited impact to build shortcuts due to the lack of labels and the dispersion of pairs in MCL. In this paper, we propose Multi-step Error Minimization (MEM), a novel optimization process for generating multimodal unlearnable examples. It extends the Error-Minimization (EM) framework to optimize both image noise and an additional text trigger, thereby enlarging the optimized space and effectively misleading the model to learn the shortcut between the noise features and the text trigger. Specifically, we adopt projected gradient descent to solve the noise minimization problem and use HotFlip to approximate the gradient and replace words to find the optimal text trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MEM, with post-protection retrieval results nearly half of random guessing, and its high transferability across different models.

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework for Audio Temporal Forgery Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel form of audio partial forgery has posed challenges to its forensics, requiring advanced countermeasures to detect subtle forgery manipulations within long-duration audio. However, existing countermeasures still serve a classification purpose and fail to perform meaningful analysis of the start and end timestamps of partial forgery segments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine proposal refinement framework (CFPRF) that incorporates a frame-level detection network (FDN) and a proposal refinement network (PRN) for audio temporal forgery detection and localization. Specifically, the FDN aims to mine informative inconsistency cues between real and fake frames to obtain discriminative features that are beneficial for roughly indicating forgery regions. The PRN is responsible for predicting confidence scores and regression offsets to refine the coarse-grained proposals derived from the FDN. To learn robust discriminative features, we devise a difference-aware feature learning (DAFL) module guided by contrastive representation learning to enlarge the sensitive differences between different frames induced by minor manipulations. We further design a boundary-aware feature enhancement (BAFE) module to capture the contextual information of multiple transition boundaries and guide the interaction between boundary information and temporal features via a cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that our CFPRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including LAV-DF, ASVS2019PS, and HAD.</description>

      <title>Wallcamera: Reinventing the Wheel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developed at MIT CSAIL, the Wallcamera has captivated the public's imagination. Here, we show that the key insight underlying the Wallcamera is the same one that underpins the concept and the prototype of differential imaging forensics (DIF), both of which were validated and reported several years prior to the Wallcamera's debut. Rather than being the first to extract and amplify invisible signals -- aka latent evidence in the forensics context -- from wall reflections in a video, or the first to propose activity recognition following that approach, the Wallcamera's actual innovation is achieving activity recognition at a finer granularity than DIF demonstrated. In addition to activity recognition, DIF as conceived has a number of other applications in forensics, including 1) the recovery of a photographer's personal identifiable information such as body width, height, and even the color of their clothing, from a single photo, and 2) the detection of image tampering and deepfake videos.</description>

      <title>PLayerTV: Advanced Player Tracking and Identification for Automatic Soccer Highlight Clips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of sports analytics, the automation of targeted video processing is a pivotal advancement. We propose PlayerTV, an innovative framework which harnesses state-of-the-art AI technologies for automatic player tracking and identification in soccer videos. By integrating object detection and tracking, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and color analysis, PlayerTV facilitates the generation of player-specific highlight clips from extensive game footage, significantly reducing the manual labor traditionally associated with such tasks. Preliminary results from the evaluation of our core pipeline, tested on a dataset from the Norwegian Eliteserien league, indicate that PlayerTV can accurately and efficiently identify teams and players, and our interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) serves as a user-friendly application wrapping this functionality for streamlined use.</description>

      <title>Learning Trimodal Relation for AVQA with Missing Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) methods rely on complete visual and audio input to answer questions accurately. However, in real-world scenarios, issues such as device malfunctions and data transmission errors frequently result in missing audio or visual modality. In such cases, existing AVQA methods suffer significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a framework that ensures robust AVQA performance even when a modality is missing. First, we propose a Relation-aware Missing Modal (RMM) generator with Relation-aware Missing Modal Recalling (RMMR) loss to enhance the ability of the generator to recall missing modal information by understanding the relationships and context among the available modalities. Second, we design an Audio-Visual Relation-aware (AVR) diffusion model with Audio-Visual Enhancing (AVE) loss to further enhance audio-visual features by leveraging the relationships and shared cues between the audio-visual modalities. As a result, our method can provide accurate answers by effectively utilizing available information even when input modalities are missing. We believe our method holds potential applications not only in AVQA research but also in various multi-modal scenarios.</description>

      <title>HSVLT: Hierarchical Scale-Aware Vision-Language Transformer for Multi-Label Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of multi-label image classification involves recognizing multiple objects within a single image. Considering both valuable semantic information contained in the labels and essential visual features presented in the image, tight visual-linguistic interactions play a vital role in improving classification performance. Moreover, given the potential variance in object size and appearance within a single image, attention to features of different scales can help to discover possible objects in the image. Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved great success in multi-label image classification by leveraging the advantage of modeling long-range dependencies, but they have several limitations. Firstly, existing methods treat visual feature extraction and cross-modal fusion as separate steps, resulting in insufficient visual-linguistic alignment in the joint semantic space. Additionally, they only extract visual features and perform cross-modal fusion at a single scale, neglecting objects with different characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Scale-Aware Vision-Language Transformer (HSVLT) with two appealing designs: (1)~A hierarchical multi-scale architecture that involves a Cross-Scale Aggregation module, which leverages joint multi-modal features extracted from multiple scales to recognize objects of varying sizes and appearances in images. (2)~Interactive Visual-Linguistic Attention, a novel attention mechanism module that tightly integrates cross-modal interaction, enabling the joint updating of visual, linguistic and multi-modal features. We have evaluated our method on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that HSVLT surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Graph Guided Multi-modal Network for Livestreaming Product Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16248v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of e-commerce, more consumers have become accustomed to making purchases via livestreaming. Accurately identifying the products being sold by salespeople, i.e., livestreaming product retrieval (LPR), poses a fundamental and daunting challenge. The LPR task encompasses three primary dilemmas in real-world scenarios: 1) the recognition of intended products from distractor products present in the background; 2) the video-image heterogeneity that the appearance of products showcased in live streams often deviates substantially from standardized product images in stores; 3) there are numerous confusing products with subtle visual nuances in the shop. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Graphing Multi-modal Network (SGMN). First, we employ a text-guided attention mechanism that leverages the spoken content of salespeople to guide the model to focus toward intended products, emphasizing their salience over cluttered background products. Second, a long-range spatiotemporal graph network is further designed to achieve both instance-level interaction and frame-level matching, solving the misalignment caused by video-image heterogeneity. Third, we propose a multi-modal hard example mining, assisting the model in distinguishing highly similar products with fine-grained features across the video-image-text domain. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed SGMN model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

      <title>QPT V2: Masked Image Modeling Advances Visual Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality assessment and aesthetics assessment aim to evaluate the perceived quality and aesthetics of visual content. Current learning-based methods suffer greatly from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform sub-optimally in terms of generalization. Although masked image modeling (MIM) has achieved noteworthy advancements across various high-level tasks (e.g., classification, detection etc.). In this work, we take on a novel perspective to investigate its capabilities in terms of quality- and aesthetics-awareness. To this end, we propose Quality- and aesthetics-aware pretraining (QPT V2), the first pretraining framework based on MIM that offers a unified solution to quality and aesthetics assessment. To perceive the high-level semantics and fine-grained details, pretraining data is curated. To comprehensively encompass quality- and aesthetics-related factors, degradation is introduced. To capture multi-scale quality and aesthetic information, model structure is modified. Extensive experimental results on 11 downstream benchmarks clearly show the superior performance of QPT V2 in comparison with current state-of-the-art approaches and other pretraining paradigms. Code and models will be released at \url{https://github.com/KeiChiTse/QPT-V2}.</description>

      <title>MicroEmo: Time-Sensitive Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Micro-Expression Dynamics in Video Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16552v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal emotion recognition capabilities, integrating multimodal cues from visual, acoustic, and linguistic contexts in the video to recognize human emotional states. However, existing methods ignore capturing local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions and do not leverage the contextual dependencies of the utterance-aware temporal segments in the video, thereby limiting their expected effectiveness to a certain extent. In this work, we propose MicroEmo, a time-sensitive MLLM aimed at directing attention to the local facial micro-expression dynamics and the contextual dependencies of utterance-aware video clips. Our model incorporates two key architectural contributions: (1) a global-local attention visual encoder that integrates global frame-level timestamp-bound image features with local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions; (2) an utterance-aware video Q-Former that captures multi-scale and contextual dependencies by generating visual token sequences for each utterance segment and for the entire video then combining them. Preliminary qualitative experiments demonstrate that in a new Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) task that exploits multi-modal and multi-faceted clues to predict emotions in an open-vocabulary (OV) manner, MicroEmo demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the latest methods.</description>

      <title>FakingRecipe: Detecting Fake News on Short Video Platforms from the Perspective of Creative Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As short-form video-sharing platforms become a significant channel for news consumption, fake news in short videos has emerged as a serious threat in the online information ecosystem, making developing detection methods for this new scenario an urgent need. Compared with that in text and image formats, fake news on short video platforms contains rich but heterogeneous information in various modalities, posing a challenge to effective feature utilization. Unlike existing works mostly focusing on analyzing what is presented, we introduce a novel perspective that considers how it might be created. Through the lens of the creative process behind news video production, our empirical analysis uncovers the unique characteristics of fake news videos in material selection and editing. Based on the obtained insights, we design FakingRecipe, a creative process-aware model for detecting fake news short videos. It captures the fake news preferences in material selection from sentimental and semantic aspects and considers the traits of material editing from spatial and temporal aspects. To improve evaluation comprehensiveness, we first construct FakeTT, an English dataset for this task, and conduct experiments on both FakeTT and the existing Chinese FakeSV dataset. The results show FakingRecipe's superiority in detecting fake news on short video platforms.</description>

      <title>DiffMesh: A Motion-aware Diffusion Framework for Human Mesh Recovery from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13397v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications. While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generate Conditional Tri-plane for 3D-aware Expression Controllable Portrait Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Export3D, a one-shot 3D-aware portrait animation method that is able to control the facial expression and camera view of a given portrait image. To achieve this, we introduce a tri-plane generator with an effective expression conditioning method, which directly generates a tri-plane of 3D prior by transferring the expression parameter of 3DMM into the source image. The tri-plane is then decoded into the image of different view through a differentiable volume rendering. Existing portrait animation methods heavily rely on image warping to transfer the expression in the motion space, challenging on disentanglement of appearance and expression. In contrast, we propose a contrastive pre-training framework for appearance-free expression parameter, eliminating undesirable appearance swap when transferring a cross-identity expression. Extensive experiments show that our pre-training framework can learn the appearance-free expression representation hidden in 3DMM, and our model can generate 3D-aware expression controllable portrait images without appearance swap in the cross-identity manner.</description>

      <title>Integrating IP Broadcasting with Audio Tags: Workflow and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The broadcasting industry is increasingly adopting IP techniques, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These include from automated closed captioning to identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.</description>
