      <title>News-Driven Stock Price Forecasting in Indian Markets: A Comparative Study of Advanced Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting stock market prices remains a complex challenge for traders, analysts, and engineers due to the multitude of factors that influence price movements. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have significantly enhanced stock price prediction capabilities. AI's ability to process vast and intricate data sets has led to more sophisticated forecasts. However, achieving consistently high accuracy in stock price forecasting remains elusive. In this paper, we leverage 30 years of historical data from national banks in India, sourced from the National Stock Exchange, to forecast stock prices. Our approach utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models, including multivariate multi-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Facebook Prophet with LightGBM optimized through Optuna, and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). We further integrate sentiment analysis from tweets and reliable financial sources such as Business Standard and Reuters, acknowledging their crucial influence on stock price fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of LSTM, GRU, and Transformer Models for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent fast-paced financial markets, investors constantly seek ways to gain an edge and make informed decisions. Although achieving perfect accuracy in stock price predictions remains elusive, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have significantly enhanced our ability to analyze historical data and identify potential trends. This paper takes AI driven stock price trend prediction as the core research, makes a model training data set of famous Tesla cars from 2015 to 2024, and compares LSTM, GRU, and Transformer Models. The analysis is more consistent with the model of stock trend prediction, and the experimental results show that the accuracy of the LSTM model is 94%. These methods ultimately allow investors to make more informed decisions and gain a clearer insight into market behaviors.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Company Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 22 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forcasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Personas Dream of Bull Markets? Comparing Human and AI Investment Strategies Through the Lens of the Five-Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to adopt a personality and behave in a human-like manner. There is a large body of research that investigates the behavioural impacts of personality in less obvious areas such as investment attitudes or creative decision making. In this study, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five personality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with the same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine if these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs are able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning style, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be accurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that is more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a survey environment.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Financial Fraud Detection: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of financial transactions has grown increasingly complex due to the expansion of global economic integration and advancements in information technology. This complexity poses greater challenges in detecting and managing financial fraud. This review explores the role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in addressing these challenges by proposing a unified framework that categorizes existing GNN methodologies applied to financial fraud detection. Specifically, by examining a series of detailed research questions, this review delves into the suitability of GNNs for financial fraud detection, their deployment in real-world scenarios, and the design considerations that enhance their effectiveness. This review reveals that GNNs are exceptionally adept at capturing complex relational patterns and dynamics within financial networks, significantly outperforming traditional fraud detection methods. Unlike previous surveys that often overlook the specific potentials of GNNs or address them only superficially, our review provides a comprehensive, structured analysis, distinctly focusing on the multifaceted applications and deployments of GNNs in financial fraud detection. This review not only highlights the potential of GNNs to improve fraud detection mechanisms but also identifies current gaps and outlines future research directions to enhance their deployment in financial systems. Through a structured review of over 100 studies, this review paper contributes to the understanding of GNN applications in financial fraud detection, offering insights into their adaptability and potential integration strategies.</description>

      <title>Utilizing RNN for Real-time Cryptocurrency Price Prediction and Trading Strategy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for real-time cryptocurrency price prediction and optimized trading strategies. Given the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, traditional forecasting models often fall short. By leveraging RNNs' capability to capture long-term patterns in time-series data, this research aims to improve accuracy in price prediction and develop effective trading strategies. The project follows a structured approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and model refinement, followed by rigorous backtesting for profitability and risk assessment. This work contributes to both the academic and practical fields by providing a robust predictive model and optimized trading strategies that address the challenges of cryptocurrency trading.</description>

      <title>Approaching multifractal complexity in decentralized cryptocurrency trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractality is a concept that helps compactly grasping the most essential features of the financial dynamics. In its fully developed form, this concept applies to essentially all mature financial markets and even to more liquid cryptocurrencies traded on the centralized exchanges. A new element that adds complexity to cryptocurrency markets is the possibility of decentralized trading. Based on the extracted tick-by-tick transaction data from the Universal Router contract of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, from June 6, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the present study using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) shows that even though liquidity on these new exchanges is still much lower compared to centralized exchanges convincing traces of multifractality are already emerging on this new trading as well. The resulting multifractal spectra are however strongly left-side asymmetric which indicates that this multifractality comes primarily from large fluctuations and small ones are more of the uncorrelated noise type. What is particularly interesting here is the fact that multifractality is more developed for time series representing transaction volumes than rates of return. On the level of these larger events a trace of multifractal cross-correlations between the two characteristics is also observed.</description>

      <title>Filling in Missing FX Implied Volatilities with Uncertainties: Improving VAE-Based Volatility Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in finance and often requires methods to fill in the gaps, or in other words, imputation. In this work, we focused on the imputation of missing implied volatilities for FX options. Prior work has used variational autoencoders (VAEs), a neural network-based approach, to solve this problem; however, using stronger classical baselines such as Heston with jumps can significantly outperform their results. We show that simple modifications to the architecture of the VAE lead to significant imputation performance improvements (e.g., in low missingness regimes, nearly cutting the error by half), removing the necessity of using $\beta$-VAEs. Further, we modify the VAE imputation algorithm in order to better handle the uncertainty in data, as well as to obtain accurate uncertainty estimates around imputed values.</description>

      <title>BreakGPT: Leveraging Large Language Models for Predicting Asset Price Surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces BreakGPT, a novel large language model (LLM) architecture adapted specifically for time series forecasting and the prediction of sharp upward movements in asset prices. By leveraging both the capabilities of LLMs and Transformer-based models, this study evaluates BreakGPT and other Transformer-based models for their ability to address the unique challenges posed by highly volatile financial markets. The primary contribution of this work lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of combining time series representation learning with LLM prediction frameworks. We showcase BreakGPT as a promising solution for financial forecasting with minimal training and as a strong competitor for capturing both local and global temporal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Daily Liquidity Jump and Diffusion, and Treatment on Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash trading among crypto assets induces short-term price jumps, which manifest as liquidity fluctuation. We develop a model to decompose asset liquidity into two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which quantify the size and probability of wash trading. Using the trading data from US stock markets as a benchmark, we establish that the combination of high liquidity diffusion and high liquidity jump indicates wash trading. On the other hand, the majority of large-volume trades with high liquidity jump but low liquidity diffusion (&lt;1) are actually legitimate ones. Our model provides advice to investors in making informed decisions in crypto investments, and to regulators in taking targeted actions to combat wash trading. While we use crypto assets to exemplify the utilities of our model, the model should remain effective for other asset classes with extreme liquidity.</description>

      <title>The lexical ratio: A new perspective on portfolio diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio diversification, traditionally measured through asset correlations and volatilitybased metrics, is fundamental to managing financial risk. However, existing diversification metrics often overlook non-numerical relationships between assets that can impact portfolio stability, particularly during market stresses. This paper introduces the lexical ratio (LR), a novel metric that leverages textual data to capture diversification dimensions absent in standard approaches. By treating each asset as a unique document composed of sectorspecific and financial keywords, the LR evaluates portfolio diversification by distributing these terms across assets, incorporating entropy-based insights from information theory. We thoroughly analyze LR's properties, including scale invariance, concavity, and maximality, demonstrating its theoretical robustness and ability to enhance risk-adjusted portfolio returns. Using empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 portfolios, we compare LR's performance to established metrics such as Markowitz's volatility-based measures and diversification ratios. Our tests reveal LR's superiority in optimizing portfolio returns, especially under varied market conditions. Our findings show that LR aligns with conventional metrics and captures unique diversification aspects, suggesting it is a viable tool for portfolio managers.</description>

      <title>Short-time expansion of characteristic functions in a rough volatility setting with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a higher-order asymptotic expansion of the conditional characteristic function of the increment of an It\^o semimartingale over a shrinking time interval. The spot characteristics of the It\^o semimartingale are allowed to have dynamics of general form. In particular, their paths can be rough, that is, exhibit local behavior like that of a fractional Brownian motion, while at the same time have jumps with arbitrary degree of activity. The expansion result shows the distinct roles played by the different features of the spot characteristics dynamics. As an application of our result, we construct a nonparametric estimator of the Hurst parameter of the diffusive volatility process from portfolios of short-dated options written on an underlying asset.</description>

      <title>Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of firms' future earnings. Even without narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes directionally. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in analysis and decision-making.</description>

      <title>When Frictions are Fractional: Rough Noise in High-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16149v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of high-frequency financial data is often impeded by the presence of noise. This article is motivated by intraday return data in which market microstructure noise appears to be rough, that is, best captured by a continuous-time stochastic process that locally behaves as fractional Brownian motion. Assuming that the underlying efficient price process follows a continuous It\^o semimartingale, we derive consistent estimators and asymptotic confidence intervals for the roughness parameter of the noise and the integrated price and noise volatilities, in all cases where these quantities are identifiable. In addition to desirable features such as serial dependence of increments, compatibility between different sampling frequencies and diurnal effects, the rough noise model can further explain divergence rates in volatility signature plots that vary considerably over time and between assets.</description>
