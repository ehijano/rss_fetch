      <title>Recoverable strain from reverse plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically recoverable and unrecoverable strain within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, consistent with the usual intuition, we find that significant subsequent strain recovery then arises not via further recoil of elasticity but instead by `reverse plasticity', in a sense that we discuss carefully. Also unexpectedly, although in rare parameter regimes, this plastic part of the strain post switch-off does not always in fact recover in the negative direction, counter to that of the previously imposed stress, but can sometimes continue to accumulate in the forward direction. The recovery is then non-monotonic overall, reminiscent of recent observations of non-monotonic stress relaxation after straining, which have been attributed to complex material memory effects. We elucidate the mechanisms underlying these behaviours in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements, and suggest connections with the notion of `reversible plasticity', as discussed in the recent physics literature.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in phase ordering: the roles of activity, noise, and non-constant mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity emerges generically in the coarsening regime of phase-separating fluids. Numerical studies of active and passive systems have shown that the structure factor $S(q)$ behaves as $q^\varsigma$ for $q\to 0$, with hyperuniformity exponent $\varsigma = 4$. For passive systems, this result was explained in 1991 by a qualitative scaling analysis of Tomita, exploiting isotropy at scales much larger than the coarsening length $\ell$. Here we reconsider and extend Tomita's argument to address cases of active phase separation and of non-constant mobility, again finding $\varsigma=4$. We further show that dynamical noise of variance $D$ creates a transient $\varsigma = 2$ regime for $\hat q\ll \hat{q}_\ast \sim \sqrt{D} t^{[1-(d+2)\nu]/2}$, crossing over to $\varsigma = 4$ at larger $\hat{q}$. Here, $\nu$ is the coarsening exponent, with $\ell\sim t^\nu$, and $\hat{q} \propto q \ell$ is the rescaled wavenumber. In diffusive coarsening, $\nu=1/3$, so the rescaled crossover wavevector $\hat{q}_\ast$ vanishes at large times when $d\geq 2$. The slowness of this decay suggests a natural explanation for experiments that observe a long-lived $\varsigma = 2$ scaling in phase-separating active fluids (where noise is typically large). Conversely, in $d=1$, we demonstrate that with noise the $\varsigma = 2$ regime survives as $t\to\infty$, with $\hat{q}_\ast\sim D^{5/6}$. (The structure factor is not then determined by the zero-temperature fixed point.) We confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of active and passive continuum theories in the deterministic case and of Model B for the stochastic case. We also compare them with related findings for a system near an absorbing-state transition rather than undergoing phase separation. A central role is played throughout by the presence or absence of a conservation law for the centre of mass position of the order parameter field.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>

      <title>Capillary-Assisted Printing of Droplets at a Solid-Like Liquid-Liquid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary forces guide the motion of biomolecular condensates, water-borne insects, and breakfast cereal. These surface-mediated interactions can be harnessed to build units into materials with exotic properties deriving from mesoscale structure. Droplets are promising building blocks for these materials, finding applications in tissue engineering, adaptive optics, and structural colour. However, the instability of water droplets at many liquid-liquid interfaces hampers the use of capillarity for the assembly of droplet-based materials. Here, we use nanoparticle surfactants to form solid-like oil-water interfaces at which aqueous droplets sit for extended periods. We find that microlitre-sized droplets at these interfaces attract each other over millimetric scales. We rationalize this interaction with a modified theory of capillarity. Applying printing methods allows us to finely control initial droplet positions, from which they self-assemble into cellular materials. Finally, by functionalising the interface with gold nanoparticles, we use plasmon-assisted optofluidics to manipulate these droplet-based materials with temperature gradients.</description>

      <title>Particle scale anisotropy controls bulk properties in sheared granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk dynamics of dense granular materials arise through a combination of particle-scale and mesoscale effects. Theoretical and numerical studies have shown that collective effects are created by particle-scale anisotropic structures such as grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and frictional mobilization, all of which influence bulk properties like bulk friction and the stress tensor through the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relationship. To date, establishing the relevance of these effects to laboratory systems has remained elusive due to the challenge of measuring both normal and frictional contact forces at the particle scale. In this study, we perform experiments on a sheared photoelastic granular system in an quasi-2D annular (Couette) cell. During these experiments, we measure particle locations, contacts, and normal and frictional forces vectors during loading. We reconstruct the angular distributions of the contact and force vectors, and extract the corresponding emergent anisotropies for each of these metrics. Finally, we show that the SFF relation quantitatively predicts the relationship between particle scale anisotropies, the stress tensor components, and the bulk friction coefficient, capturing even transient behaviors. As such, this method shows promise for application to other dense particulate systems where fabric anisotropy can provide a useful measure of bulk friction.</description>

      <title>Transport of topological defects in a biphasic mixture of active and passive nematic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectively moving cellular systems often contain a proportion of dead cells or non-motile genotypes. When mixed, nematically aligning motile and non-motile agents are known to segregate spontaneously. However, the role that topological defects and active stresses play in shaping the distribution of the two phases remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the behaviour of a two-dimensional binary mixture of active and passive nematic fluids to understand how topological defects are transported between the two phases and, ultimately, how this leads to the segregation of topological charges. When the activity of the motile phase is large, and the tension at the interface of motile and non-motile phases is weak, we find that the active phase tends to accumulate $+1/2$ defects and expel $-1/2$ defects so that the motile phase develops a net positive charge. Conversely, when the activity of the motile phase is comparatively small and interfacial tension is strong, the opposite occurs so that the active phase develops a net negative charge. We then use these simulations to develop a physical intuition of the underlying processes that drive the charge segregation. Lastly, we quantify the sensitivity of this process on the other model parameters, by exploring the effect that anchoring strength, orientational elasticity, friction, and volume fraction of the motile phase have on topological charge segregation. As $+1/2$ and $-1/2$ defects have very different effects on interface morphology and fluid transport, this study offers new insights into the spontaneous pattern formation that occurs when motile and non-motile cells interact.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limits of Energy Extraction in Active Fluids</title>

Abstract: Active materials form a class of far-from-equilibrium systems that are driven internally and exhibit self-organization which can be harnessed to perform mechanical work. Inspired by experiments on synthetic active networks we examine limits of work extraction from an active viscoelastic medium by analyzing the transport of a particle. The active viscoelastic material possesses an equilibrium density where the active and passive forces are balanced out. In one dimension, a gliding activation front (AF) that converts a passive to an active medium, provides active energy at a constant rate, which is injected into the system at one end and propagates to the other. We demonstrate that there exists a maximum velocity of the AF, above which the activated region fails to deliver the transport power. We hypothesize, and intuitively argue based on the limit cases, that the feasibility and the velocity of transport can be interpreted in terms of the velocity of an equilibration Domain Wall of the field, which is set by two parameters: a measure of activity, and the viscoelastic timescale. The phase diagram comprises Transport and No-Transport sectors, namely for any pair of the two parameters, there exists a threshold velocity of the AF above which the particle transport becomes impossible. Constructing the phase diagram we find that there are regions of the phase diagram for which the threshold velocity of the AF diverges. Larger viscoelastic timescale makes the transport region more accessible, and increases the transport velocity therein. Also, we find that increasing the velocity of AF results in larger extracted power but smaller transport coefficient; the ratio of the transport velocity and that of the AF. Our model provides a framework for understanding the energetics of transport phenomena in biology, and designing efficient mechanisms of transport in synthetic active materials.</description>

      <title>Active Sparse Bayesian Committee Machine Potential for Isothermal-Isobaric Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly impacted the fields of chemistry, physics, and biology by enabling large-scale first-principles simulations. Among different machine learning approaches, kernel-based MLPs distinguish themselves through their ability to handle small datasets, quantify uncertainties, and minimize over-fitting. Nevertheless, their extensive computational requirements present considerable challenges. To alleviate these, sparsification methods have been developed, aiming to reduce computational scaling without compromising accuracy. In the context of isothermal and isobaric ML molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, achieving precise pressure estimation is crucial for reproducing reliable system behavior under constant pressure. Despite progress, sparse kernel MLPs struggle with precise pressure prediction. Here, we introduce a virial kernel function that significantly enhances pressure estimation accuracy of MLPs. Additionally, we propose the active sparse Bayesian committee machine (BCM) potential, an on-the-fly MLP architecture that aggregates local sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) MLPs. The sparse BCM potential overcomes the steep computational scaling with the kernel size, and a predefined restriction on the size of kernel allows for a fast and efficient on-the-fly training. Our advancements facilitate accurate and computationally efficient machine learning-enhanced MD (MLMD) simulations across diverse systems, including ice-liquid coexisting phases, \ce{Li10Ge(PS6)2} lithium solid electrolyte, and high-pressure liquid boron nitride.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the stochastic thermodynamics of a probe coupled to a fluctuating medium with spatio-temporal correlations, described by a scalar field. For a Brownian particle dragged by a harmonic trap through a fluctuating Gaussian field, we show that near criticality (where the field displays long-range spatial correlations) the spatially-resolved average heat flux develops a dipolar structure, where heat is absorbed in front and dissipated behind the dragged particle. Moreover, a perturbative calculation reveals that the dissipated power displays three distinct dynamical regimes depending on the drag velocity.</description>

      <title>Reduced stress propagation leads to increased mechanical failure resistance in auxetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials with negative Poisson ratio have the counter-intuitive property of expanding laterally when they are stretched longitudinally. They are accordingly termed auxetic, from the Greek auxesis meaning to increase. Experimental studies have demonstrated auxetic materials to have superior material properties, compared with conventional ones. These include synclastic curvature, increased acoustic absorption, increased resilience to material fatigue, and increased resistance to mechanical failure. Until now, the latter observations have remained poorly understood theoretically. With this motivation, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we elucidate analytically the way in which stress propagates spatially across a material following a localised plastic failure event, finding a significantly reduced stress propagation in auxetic materials compared with conventional ones. In this way, a plastic failure event occurring in one part of a material has a reduced tendency to trigger knock-on plastic events in neighbouring regions. Second, via the numerical simulation of a lattice elastoplastic model, we demonstrate a key consequence of this reduced stress propagation to be an increased resistance to mechanical failure. This is seen not only via an increase in the externally measured yield strain, but also via a decreased tendency for plastic damage to percolate internally across a sample in catastrophic system-spanning clusters.</description>

      <title>The role of viscosity on drop impact forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$--one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact velocity) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). \VS{The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data.} The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>
