      <title>Semi-Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds carrying generalized Killing spinors and the classification of Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds admitting a type I imaginary generalized Killing spinor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds carrying a type I imaginary generalized Killing spinor, by explicitly constructing a parallel spinor on each leaf of the canonical foliation given by the Dirac current. We also provide a class of Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds carrying a type II imaginary generalized Killing spinor, by considering spacelike hypersurfaces of Lorentzian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds. We carry out much of the work in the setting of semi-Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$-manifolds carrying generalized Killing spinors, allowing us to draw conclusions in this setting as well. In this context, the Dirac current is not always a closed vector field. We circumvent this in even dimensions, by considering a modified Dirac current, which is closed in the cases when the original Dirac current is not. On the path to these results, we also study semi-Riemannian manifolds carrying closed and conformal vector fields.</description>

      <title>Harmful structures and Killing spinors on unimodular Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudo-Riemannian Einstein manifold with a Killing spinor and Killing constant $\lambda$ induces on its nondegenerate hypersurfaces a pair of spinors $\phi,\psi$ and a symmetric tensor $A$, corresponding to the second fundamental form. Viewed as an intrinsic object, $(\phi,\psi,A,\lambda)$ is known as a harmful structure; this notion generalizes nearly hypo and nearly half-flat structures to arbitrary dimension and signature. We show that when $A$ is a multiple of the identity the harmful structure is determined by a Killing spinor. We characterize left-invariant harmful structures on Lie groups in terms of Clifford multiplication by some special elements induced by the structure constants and metric. This enables us to classify left-invariant harmful structures on unimodular metric Lie groups of definite or Lorentzian signature and dimension $\leq 4$, under the assumption that the symmetric tensor $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$. These pseudo-Riemannian Lie groups are principal orbits of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics of Riemannian, Lorentzian or anti-Lorentzian signature with a Killing spinor.</description>

      <title>$HS$-tensional maps and $HM$-tensional maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\psi: (M,g)\longrightarrow (N,h)$ be a smooth map between Riemannian manifolds. The tension field of $\psi$ can be regarded as a map from $(M,g)$ into the Riemannian vector bundle $\psi^{-1}TN$, equipped with the Sasaki metric $G_{S}$. In this paper, we study certain aspects of two types of maps: those whose tension fields are harmonic maps (called $HM$-tensional maps) and those whose tension fields are harmonic sections (called $HS$-tensional maps).</description>

      <title>Spheres with parallel mean curvature in $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a surface with parallel mean curvature vector field in a Riemannian product of two surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature carries a holomorphic quadratic differential. In this paper we consider the Riemannian product of a sphere and a hyperbolic plane of opposite Gaussian curvatures and study the parallel mean curvature surfaces for which the differential vanishes. In particular, we classify all parallel mean curvature spheres, for which the differential vanishes for topological reasons.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of $S_2$-isotropic solutions to the isotropic $L_p$ Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral properties of the Hilbert-Brunn-Minkowski operator $L_K$ to derive stability estimates for geometric inequalities, including the local Brunn-Minkowski inequality. By analyzing the eigenvalues of $L_K$, we establish the uniqueness of $S_2$-isotropic solutions to the isotropic $L_p$ Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $\frac{1-3n^2}{2n}\leq p&lt;-n$ with $\lambda_2(-L_K)\geq \frac{n-1}{2n-1+p}$. Furthermore, we extend this uniqueness result to the range $-2n-1 \leq p&lt;-n$ with $\lambda_2(-L_K)\geq \frac{-p-1}{n-1}$, assuming the origin-centred condition.</description>

      <title>Semi-flat constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric on elliptic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and construct a novel type of canonical metric: the semi-flat constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (semi-flat cscK) current, which naturally arises in Calabi-Yau fibrations. For a given elliptic surface $X$ with a holomorphic section, We explicitly construct the desired semi-flat cscK current and analyze its behavior along singular parts. We establish its uniqueness under the condition that $X$ possesses at least one singular fiber other than of type $I_b$ or $I_b^*$. These results contribute to a geometric uniformization program for elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective variant of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, then review effective results on K-stability of spherical varieties, that is, K-stability criterions which can be effectively computed given the combinatorial data associated with the variety. We focus on the standard notion of K-stability as defined by Donaldson for constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological rigidity of pinched submanifolds II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry and topology of compact submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in space forms that satisfy a pinching condition involving the length of the second fundamental form and the mean curvature. Our primary focus is on four-dimensional submanifolds, where both the results obtained and the methods employed differ substantially and are considerably more intricate than in higher dimensions. This study relies critically on concepts from four-dimensional geometry, the theory of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative isotropic curvature, and the Bochner technique, each playing an essential role. The results are sharp and extend previous work by several authors, without imposing additional assumptions on either the mean curvature or the fundamental group of the submanifold.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with kinks and the asymptotic behavior of the graph Laplacian operator with Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce manifolds with kinks, a class of manifolds with possibly singular boundary that notably contains manifolds with smooth boundary and corners. We derive the asymptotic behavior of the Graph Laplace operator with Gaussian kernel and its deterministic limit on these spaces as bandwidth goes to zero. We show that this asymptotic behavior is determined by the inward sector of the tangent space and, as special cases, we derive its behavior near interior and singular points. Lastly, we show the validity of our theoretical results using numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>A note on pullbacks and blowups of Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures are closely related objects. We examine the relation between their pullbacks under maps satisfying a constant rank or transversality assumption. A special case is given by blowdown maps. In that case, we also establish the relation between the blowup of a Lie algebroid and its singular foliation.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for $p$-Hessian equations with general left-hand and right-hand terms on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$. To overcome the constraints of closed manifolds, we advance a new kind of "subsolution", called pseudo-solution, which generalizes "$\mathcal{C}$-subsolution" to some extent and is well-defined for fully general $p$-Hessian equations. Based on pseudo-solutions, we prove the $\mathrm{C}^1$ estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations, and the corresponding second-order estimates when $p\in\{2, n-1, n\}$, under sharp conditions -- we don't impose curvature restrictions, convexity conditions or "MTW condition" on our main results. Some other conclusions related to a priori estimates and different kinds of "subsolutions" are also given, including estimates for "semi-convex" solutions and when there exists a pseudo-solution.</description>
