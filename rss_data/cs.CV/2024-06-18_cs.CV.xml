      <title>Sign Language Recognition based on YOLOv5 Algorithm for the Telugu Sign Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) technology has enormous promise to improve communication and accessibility for the difficulty of hearing. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying gestures in TSL using the YOLOv5 object identification framework. The main goal is to create an accurate and successful method for identifying TSL gestures so that the deaf community can use slr. After that, a deep learning model was created that used the YOLOv5 to recognize and classify gestures. This model benefited from the YOLOv5 architecture's high accuracy, speed, and capacity to handle complex sign language features. Utilizing transfer learning approaches, the YOLOv5 model was customized to TSL gestures. To attain the best outcomes, careful parameter and hyperparameter adjustment was carried out during training. With F1-score and mean Average Precision (mAP) ratings of 90.5% and 98.1%, the YOLOv5-medium model stands out for its outstanding performance metrics, demonstrating its efficacy in Telugu sign language identification tasks. Surprisingly, this model strikes an acceptable balance between computational complexity and training time to produce these amazing outcomes. Because it offers a convincing blend of accuracy and efficiency, the YOLOv5-medium model, trained for 200 epochs, emerges as the recommended choice for real-world deployment. The system's stability and generalizability across various TSL gestures and settings were evaluated through rigorous testing and validation, which yielded outstanding accuracy. This research lays the foundation for future advancements in accessible technology for linguistic communities by providing a cutting-edge application of deep learning and computer vision techniques to TSL gesture identification. It also offers insightful perspectives and novel approaches to the field of sign language recognition.</description>

      <title>Object criticality for safer navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection in autonomous driving consists in perceiving and locating instances of objects in multi-dimensional data, such as images or lidar scans. Very recently, multiple works are proposing to evaluate object detectors by measuring their ability to detect the objects that are most likely to interfere with the driving task. Detectors are then ranked according to their ability to detect the most relevant objects, rather than the highest number of objects. However there is little evidence so far that the relevance of predicted object may contribute to the safety and reliability improvement of the driving task. This position paper elaborates on a strategy, together with partial results, to i) configure and deploy object detectors that successfully extract knowledge on object relevance, and ii) use such knowledge to improve the trajectory planning task. We show that, given an object detector, filtering objects based on their relevance, in combination with the traditional confidence threshold, reduces the risk of missing relevant objects, decreases the likelihood of dangerous trajectories, and improves the quality of trajectories in general.</description>

      <title>Creating a Lens of Chinese Culture: A Multimodal Dataset for Chinese Pun Rebus Art Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding everyday content. However, their performance in the domain of art, particularly culturally rich art forms, remains less explored. As a pearl of human wisdom and creativity, art encapsulates complex cultural narratives and symbolism. In this paper, we offer the Pun Rebus Art Dataset, a multimodal dataset for art understanding deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture. We focus on three primary tasks: identifying salient visual elements, matching elements with their symbolic meanings, and explanations for the conveyed messages. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with these tasks, often providing biased and hallucinated explanations and showing limited improvement through in-context learning. By releasing the Pun Rebus Art Dataset, we aim to facilitate the development of VLMs that can better understand and interpret culturally specific content, promoting greater inclusiveness beyond English-based corpora.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for natural language performs well and has become widely adopted, its adoption for other modalities has been slower. Here, we introduce Lie group Relative position Encodings (LieRE) that goes beyond RoPE in supporting higher dimensional inputs. We evaluate the performance of LieRE on 2D and 3D image classification tasks and observe that LieRE leads to marked improvements in performance (up to 6%), training efficiency (3.5x reduction), data efficiency (30%) compared to the baselines of RoFormer, DeiT III, RoPE-Mixed and Vision-Llama</description>

      <title>L4GM: Large 4D Gaussian Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present L4GM, the first 4D Large Reconstruction Model that produces animated objects from a single-view video input -- in a single feed-forward pass that takes only a second. Key to our success is a novel dataset of multiview videos containing curated, rendered animated objects from Objaverse. This dataset depicts 44K diverse objects with 110K animations rendered in 48 viewpoints, resulting in 12M videos with a total of 300M frames. We keep our L4GM simple for scalability and build directly on top of LGM, a pretrained 3D Large Reconstruction Model that outputs 3D Gaussian ellipsoids from multiview image input. L4GM outputs a per-frame 3D Gaussian Splatting representation from video frames sampled at a low fps and then upsamples the representation to a higher fps to achieve temporal smoothness. We add temporal self-attention layers to the base LGM to help it learn consistency across time, and utilize a per-timestep multiview rendering loss to train the model. The representation is upsampled to a higher framerate by training an interpolation model which produces intermediate 3D Gaussian representations. We showcase that L4GM that is only trained on synthetic data generalizes extremely well on in-the-wild videos, producing high quality animated 3D assets.</description>

      <title>VANE-Bench: Video Anomaly Evaluation Benchmark for Conversational LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent developments in Large Multi-modal Video Models (Video-LMMs) have significantly enhanced our ability to interpret and analyze video data. Despite their impressive capabilities, current Video-LMMs have not been evaluated for anomaly detection tasks, which is critical to their deployment in practical scenarios e.g., towards identifying deepfakes, manipulated video content, traffic accidents and crimes. In this paper, we introduce VANE-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the proficiency of Video-LMMs in detecting and localizing anomalies and inconsistencies in videos. Our dataset comprises an array of videos synthetically generated using existing state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, encompassing a variety of subtle anomalies and inconsistencies grouped into five categories: unnatural transformations, unnatural appearance, pass-through, disappearance and sudden appearance. Additionally, our benchmark features real-world samples from existing anomaly detection datasets, focusing on crime-related irregularities, atypical pedestrian behavior, and unusual events. The task is structured as a visual question-answering challenge to gauge the models' ability to accurately detect and localize the anomalies within the videos. We evaluate nine existing Video-LMMs, both open and closed sources, on this benchmarking task and find that most of the models encounter difficulties in effectively identifying the subtle anomalies. In conclusion, our research offers significant insights into the current capabilities of Video-LMMs in the realm of anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of our work in evaluating and improving these models for real-world applications.

      <title>From Pixels to Prose: A Large Dataset of Dense Image Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large vision-language models requires extensive, high-quality image-text pairs. Existing web-scraped datasets, however, are noisy and lack detailed image descriptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PixelProse, a comprehensive dataset of over 16M (million) synthetically generated captions, leveraging cutting-edge vision-language models for detailed and accurate descriptions. To ensure data integrity, we rigorously analyze our dataset for problematic content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), personally identifiable information (PII), and toxicity. We also provide valuable metadata such as watermark presence and aesthetic scores, aiding in further dataset filtering. We hope PixelProse will be a valuable resource for future vision-language research. PixelProse is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomg-group-umd/pixelprose</description>

      <title>Wild-GS: Real-Time Novel View Synthesis from Unconstrained Photo Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photographs captured in unstructured tourist environments frequently exhibit variable appearances and transient occlusions, challenging accurate scene reconstruction and inducing artifacts in novel view synthesis. Although prior approaches have integrated the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with additional learnable modules to handle the dynamic appearances and eliminate transient objects, their extensive training demands and slow rendering speeds limit practical deployments. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising alternative to NeRF, offering superior training and inference efficiency along with better rendering quality. This paper presents Wild-GS, an innovative adaptation of 3DGS optimized for unconstrained photo collections while preserving its efficiency benefits. Wild-GS determines the appearance of each 3D Gaussian by their inherent material attributes, global illumination and camera properties per image, and point-level local variance of reflectance. Unlike previous methods that model reference features in image space, Wild-GS explicitly aligns the pixel appearance features to the corresponding local Gaussians by sampling the triplane extracted from the reference image. This novel design effectively transfers the high-frequency detailed appearance of the reference view to 3D space and significantly expedites the training process. Furthermore, 2D visibility maps and depth regularization are leveraged to mitigate the transient effects and constrain the geometry, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Wild-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance and the highest efficiency in both training and inference among all the existing techniques.</description>

      <title>What is the Visual Cognition Gap between Humans and Multimodal LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level reasoning is not well-established. One such challenge is abstract visual reasoning (AVR) -- the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the AVR tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA and a new benchmark VCog-Bench containing three datasets to evaluate the zero-shot AVR capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human intelligent investigation. Our comparative experiments with different open-source and closed-source MLLMs on the VCog-Bench revealed a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of VCog-Bench, consisting of MaRs-VQA, and the inference pipeline will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities.</description>

      <title>Consistency-diversity-realism Pareto fronts of conditional image generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building world models that accurately and comprehensively represent the real world is the utmost aspiration for conditional image generative models as it would enable their use as world simulators. For these models to be successful world models, they should not only excel at image quality and prompt-image consistency but also ensure high representation diversity. However, current research in generative models mostly focuses on creative applications that are predominantly concerned with human preferences of image quality and aesthetics. We note that generative models have inference time mechanisms - or knobs - that allow the control of generation consistency, quality, and diversity. In this paper, we use state-of-the-art text-to-image and image-and-text-to-image models and their knobs to draw consistency-diversity-realism Pareto fronts that provide a holistic view on consistency-diversity-realism multi-objective. Our experiments suggest that realism and consistency can both be improved simultaneously; however there exists a clear tradeoff between realism/consistency and diversity. By looking at Pareto optimal points, we note that earlier models are better at representation diversity and worse in consistency/realism, and more recent models excel in consistency/realism while decreasing significantly the representation diversity. By computing Pareto fronts on a geodiverse dataset, we find that the first version of latent diffusion models tends to perform better than more recent models in all axes of evaluation, and there exist pronounced consistency-diversity-realism disparities between geographical regions. Overall, our analysis clearly shows that there is no best model and the choice of model should be determined by the downstream application. With this analysis, we invite the research community to consider Pareto fronts as an analytical tool to measure progress towards world models.</description>

      <title>The BabyView dataset: High-resolution egocentric videos of infants' and young children's everyday experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human children far exceed modern machine learning algorithms in their sample efficiency, achieving high performance in key domains with much less data than current models. This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience -- their ''training data'' -- is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of the largest developmental egocentric video dataset to date -- the BabyView dataset -- recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 493 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months - 5 years of age in both longitudinal, at-home contexts and in a preschool environment. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, humanlike AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?</description>

      <title>Improving Ab-Initio Cryo-EM Reconstruction with Semi-Amortized Pose Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is an increasingly popular experimental technique for estimating the 3D structure of macromolecular complexes such as proteins based on 2D images. These images are notoriously noisy, and the pose of the structure in each image is unknown \textit{a priori}. Ab-initio 3D reconstruction from 2D images entails estimating the pose in addition to the structure. In this work, we propose a new approach to this problem. We first adopt a multi-head architecture as a pose encoder to infer multiple plausible poses per-image in an amortized fashion. This approach mitigates the high uncertainty in pose estimation by encouraging exploration of pose space early in reconstruction. Once uncertainty is reduced, we refine poses in an auto-decoding fashion. In particular, we initialize with the most likely pose and iteratively update it for individual images using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Through evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our method is able to handle multi-modal pose distributions during the amortized inference stage, while the later, more flexible stage of direct pose optimization yields faster and more accurate convergence of poses compared to baselines. Finally, on experimental data, we show that our approach is faster than state-of-the-art cryoAI and achieves higher-resolution reconstruction.</description>

      <title>CoMM: A Coherent Interleaved Image-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interleaved image-text generation has emerged as a crucial multimodal task, aiming at creating sequences of interleaved visual and textual content given a query. Despite notable advancements in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating integrated image-text sequences that exhibit narrative coherence and entity and style consistency remains challenging due to poor training data quality. To address this gap, we introduce CoMM, a high-quality Coherent interleaved image-text MultiModal dataset designed to enhance the coherence, consistency, and alignment of generated multimodal content. Initially, CoMM harnesses raw data from diverse sources, focusing on instructional content and visual storytelling, establishing a foundation for coherent and consistent content. To further refine the data quality, we devise a multi-perspective filter strategy that leverages advanced pre-trained models to ensure the development of sentences, consistency of inserted images, and semantic alignment between them. Various quality evaluation metrics are designed to prove the high quality of the filtered dataset. Meanwhile, extensive few-shot experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate CoMM's effectiveness in significantly enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs. Moreover, we propose four new tasks to evaluate MLLMs' interleaved generation abilities, supported by a comprehensive evaluation framework. We believe CoMM opens a new avenue for advanced MLLMs with superior multimodal in-context learning and understanding ability.</description>

      <title>Discrete Latent Perspective Learning for Segmentation and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Perspective-Invariant Learning in machine learning and computer vision, which involves enabling a network to understand images from varying perspectives to achieve consistent semantic interpretation. While standard approaches rely on the labor-intensive collection of multi-view images or limited data augmentation techniques, we propose a novel framework, Discrete Latent Perspective Learning (DLPL), for latent multi-perspective fusion learning using conventional single-view images. DLPL comprises three main modules: Perspective Discrete Decomposition (PDD), Perspective Homography Transformation (PHT), and Perspective Invariant Attention (PIA), which work together to discretize visual features, transform perspectives, and fuse multi-perspective semantic information, respectively. DLPL is a universal perspective learning framework applicable to a variety of scenarios and vision tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DLPL significantly enhances the network's capacity to depict images across diverse scenarios (daily photos, UAV, auto-driving) and tasks (detection, segmentation).</description>

Abstract: The emerging video LMMs (Large Multimodal Models) have achieved significant improvements on generic video understanding in the form of VQA (Visual Question Answering), where the raw videos are captured by cameras. However, a large portion of videos in real-world applications are edited videos, \textit{e.g.}, users usually cut and add effects/modifications to the raw video before publishing it on social media platforms. The edited videos usually have high view counts but they are not covered in existing benchmarks of video LMMs, \textit{i.e.}, ActivityNet-QA, or VideoChatGPT benchmark. In this paper, we leverage the edited videos on a popular short video platform, \textit{i.e.}, TikTok, and build a video VQA benchmark (named EditVid-QA) covering four typical editing categories, i.e., effect, funny, meme, and game. Funny and meme videos benchmark nuanced understanding and high-level reasoning, while effect and game evaluate the understanding capability of artificial design. Most of the open-source video LMMs perform poorly on the EditVid-QA benchmark, indicating a huge domain gap between edited short videos on social media and regular raw videos. To improve the generalization ability of LMMs, we collect a training set for the proposed benchmark based on both Panda-70M/WebVid raw videos and small-scale TikTok/CapCut edited videos, which boosts the performance on the proposed EditVid-QA benchmark, indicating the effectiveness of high-quality training data. We also identified a serious issue in the existing evaluation protocol using the GPT-3.5 judge, namely a "sorry" attack, where a sorry-style naive answer can achieve an extremely high rating from the GPT judge, e.g., over 4.3 for correctness score on VideoChatGPT evaluation protocol. To avoid the "sorry" attacks, we evaluate results with GPT-4 judge and keyword filtering. The datasets will be released for academic purposes only.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Spatial-Temporal Consistency for Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there have been efforts to improve the performance in sign language recognition by designing self-supervised learning methods. However, these methods capture limited information from sign pose data in a frame-wise learning manner, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-supervised contrastive learning framework to excavate rich context via spatial-temporal consistency from two distinct perspectives and learn instance discriminative representation for sign language recognition. On one hand, since the semantics of sign language are expressed by the cooperation of fine-grained hands and coarse-grained trunks, we utilize both granularity information and encode them into latent spaces. The consistency between hand and trunk features is constrained to encourage learning consistent representation of instance samples. On the other hand, inspired by the complementary property of motion and joint modalities, we first introduce first-order motion information into sign language modeling. Additionally, we further bridge the interaction between the embedding spaces of both modalities, facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer to enhance sign language representation. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sakura/Code.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adapt Foundation Model DINOv2 for Capsule Endoscopy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have become prominent in computer vision, achieving notable success in various tasks. However, their effectiveness largely depends on pre-training with extensive datasets. Applying foundation models directly to small datasets of capsule endoscopy images from scratch is challenging. Pre-training on broad, general vision datasets is crucial for successfully fine-tuning our model for specific tasks. In this work, we introduce a simplified approach called Adapt foundation models with a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique for easier customization. Our method, inspired by the DINOv2 foundation model, applies low-rank adaptation learning to tailor foundation models for capsule endoscopy diagnosis effectively. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, our strategy includes LoRA layers designed to absorb specific surgical domain knowledge. During the training process, we keep the main model (the backbone encoder) fixed and focus on optimizing the LoRA layers and the disease classification component. We tested our method on two publicly available datasets for capsule endoscopy disease classification. The results were impressive, with our model achieving 97.75% accuracy on the Kvasir-Capsule dataset and 98.81% on the Kvasirv2 dataset. Our solution demonstrates that foundation models can be adeptly adapted for capsule endoscopy diagnosis, highlighting that mere reliance on straightforward fine-tuning or pre-trained models from general computer vision tasks is inadequate for such specific applications.</description>

      <title>Self Pre-training with Topology- and Spatiality-aware Masked Autoencoders for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have been shown to be effective in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs) for natural and medical image analysis problems. By reconstructing missing pixel/voxel information in visible patches, a ViT encoder can aggregate contextual information for downstream tasks. But, existing MAE pre-training methods, which were specifically developed with the ViT architecture, lack the ability to capture geometric shape and spatial information, which is critical for medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of known MAEs for self pre-training (i.e., models pre-trained on the same target dataset) for 3D medical image segmentation. (1) We propose a new topological loss to preserve geometric shape information by computing topological signatures of both the input and reconstructed volumes, learning geometric shape information. (2) We introduce a pre-text task that predicts the positions of the centers and eight corners of 3D crops, enabling the MAE to aggregate spatial information. (3) We extend the MAE pre-training strategy to a hybrid state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation architecture and co-pretrain it alongside the ViT. (4) We develop a fine-tuned model for downstream segmentation tasks by complementing the pre-trained ViT encoder with our pre-trained SOTA model. Extensive experiments on five public 3D segmentation datasets show the effectiveness of our new approach.</description>

      <title>Full reference point cloud quality assessment using support vector regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds are a general format for representing realistic 3D objects in diverse 3D applications. Since point clouds have large data sizes, developing efficient point cloud compression methods is crucial. However, excessive compression leads to various distortions, which deteriorates the point cloud quality perceived by end users. Thus, establishing reliable point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods is essential as a benchmark to develop efficient compression methods. This paper presents an accurate full-reference point cloud quality assessment (FR-PCQA) method called full-reference quality assessment using support vector regression (FRSVR) for various types of degradations such as compression distortion, Gaussian noise, and down-sampling. The proposed method demonstrates accurate PCQA by integrating five FR-based metrics covering various types of errors (e.g., considering geometric distortion, color distortion, and point count) using support vector regression (SVR). Moreover, the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and calculation speed because it includes only the calculation of these five simple metrics and SVR, which can perform fast prediction. Experimental results with three types of open datasets show that the proposed method is more accurate than conventional FR-PCQA methods. In addition, the proposed method is faster than state-of-the-art methods that utilize complicated features such as curvature and multi-scale features. Thus, the proposed method provides excellent performance in terms of the accuracy of PCQA and processing speed. Our method is available from https://github.com/STAC-USC/FRSVR-PCQA.</description>

      <title>Panoptic-FlashOcc: An Efficient Baseline to Marry Semantic Occupancy with Panoptic via Instance Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoptic occupancy poses a novel challenge by aiming to integrate instance occupancy and semantic occupancy within a unified framework. However, there is still a lack of efficient solutions for panoptic occupancy. In this paper, we propose Panoptic-FlashOcc, a straightforward yet robust 2D feature framework that enables realtime panoptic occupancy. Building upon the lightweight design of FlashOcc, our approach simultaneously learns semantic occupancy and class-aware instance clustering in a single network, these outputs are jointly incorporated through panoptic occupancy procession for panoptic occupancy. This approach effectively addresses the drawbacks of high memory and computation requirements associated with three-dimensional voxel-level representations. With its straightforward and efficient design that facilitates easy deployment, Panoptic-FlashOcc demonstrates remarkable achievements in panoptic occupancy prediction. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, it achieves exceptional performance, with 38.5 RayIoU and 29.1 mIoU for semantic occupancy, operating at a rapid speed of 43.9 FPS. Furthermore, it attains a notable score of 16.0 RayPQ for panoptic occupancy, accompanied by a fast inference speed of 30.2 FPS. These results surpass the performance of existing methodologies in terms of both speed and accuracy.

      <title>PIG: Prompt Images Guidance for Night-Time Scene Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Night-time scene parsing aims to extract pixel-level semantic information in night images, aiding downstream tasks in understanding scene object distribution. Due to limited labeled night image datasets, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become the predominant method for studying night scenes. UDA typically relies on paired day-night image pairs to guide adaptation, but this approach hampers dataset construction and restricts generalization across night scenes in different datasets. Moreover, UDA, focusing on network architecture and training strategies, faces difficulties in handling classes with few domain similarities. In this paper, we leverage Prompt Images Guidance (PIG) to enhance UDA with supplementary night knowledge. We propose a Night-Focused Network (NFNet) to learn night-specific features from both target domain images and prompt images. To generate high-quality pseudo-labels, we propose Pseudo-label Fusion via Domain Similarity Guidance (FDSG). Classes with fewer domain similarities are predicted by NFNet, which excels in parsing night features, while classes with more domain similarities are predicted by UDA, which has rich labeled semantics. Additionally, we propose two data augmentation strategies: the Prompt Mixture Strategy (PMS) and the Alternate Mask Strategy (AMS), aimed at mitigating the overfitting of the NFNet to a few prompt images. We conduct extensive experiments on four night-time datasets: NightCity, NightCity+, Dark Zurich, and ACDC. The results indicate that utilizing PIG can enhance the parsing accuracy of UDA.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual clothes try-on has emerged as a vital feature in online shopping, offering consumers a critical tool to visualize how clothing fits. In our research, we introduce an innovative approach for virtual clothes try-on, utilizing a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) coupled with a diffusion model. Our method emphasizes detail enhancement by contrasting local clothing image embeddings, generated by ViT, with their global counterparts. Techniques such as conditional guidance and focus on key regions have been integrated into our approach. These combined strategies empower the diffusion model to reproduce clothing details with increased clarity and realism. The experimental results showcase substantial advancements in the realism and precision of details in virtual try-on experiences, significantly surpassing the capabilities of existing technologies.</description>

      <title>NeRFDeformer: NeRF Transformation from a Single View via 3D Scene Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for automatically modifying a NeRF representation based on a single observation of a non-rigid transformed version of the original scene. Our method defines the transformation as a 3D flow, specifically as a weighted linear blending of rigid transformations of 3D anchor points that are defined on the surface of the scene. In order to identify anchor points, we introduce a novel correspondence algorithm that first matches RGB-based pairs, then leverages multi-view information and 3D reprojection to robustly filter false positives in two steps. We also introduce a new dataset for exploring the problem of modifying a NeRF scene through a single observation. Our dataset ( https://github.com/nerfdeformer/nerfdeformer ) contains 113 synthetic scenes leveraging 47 3D assets. We show that our proposed method outperforms NeRF editing methods as well as diffusion-based methods, and we also explore different methods for filtering correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10553v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis, an advanced method for generating portrait videos from a still image driven by specific content, has garnered widespread attention in virtual reality, augmented reality and game production. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been made with the introduction of novel models such as the transformer and the diffusion model. Current methods can not only generate new content but also edit the generated material. This survey systematically reviews the technology, categorizing it into three pivotal domains: portrait generation, driven mechanisms, and editing techniques. We summarize milestone studies and critically analyze their innovations and shortcomings within each domain. Additionally, we organize an extensive collection of datasets and provide a thorough performance analysis of current methodologies based on various evaluation metrics, aiming to furnish a clear framework and robust data support for future research. Finally, we explore application scenarios of talking head synthesis, illustrate them with specific cases, and examine potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Robust Image Classification in the Presence of Out-of-Distribution and Adversarial Samples Using Attractors in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in deep classifiers is a critical concern for ensuring the suitability of deep neural networks in safety-critical systems. Existing approaches developed for robust OOD detection in the presence of adversarial attacks lose their performance by increasing the perturbation levels. This study proposes a method for robust classification in the presence of OOD samples and adversarial attacks with high perturbation levels. The proposed approach utilizes a fully connected neural network that is trained to use training samples as its attractors, enhancing its robustness. This network has the ability to classify inputs and identify OOD samples as well. To evaluate this method, the network is trained on the MNIST dataset, and its performance is tested on adversarial examples. The results indicate that the network maintains its performance even when classifying adversarial examples, achieving 87.13% accuracy when dealing with highly perturbed MNIST test data. Furthermore, by using fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10-bw as OOD samples, the network can distinguish these samples from MNIST samples with an accuracy of 98.84% and 99.28%, respectively. In the presence of severe adversarial attacks, these measures decrease slightly to 98.48% and 98.88%, indicating the robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>IMDL-BenCo: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Codebase for Image Manipulation Detection &amp; Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive benchmark is yet to be established in the Image Manipulation Detection \&amp; Localization (IMDL) field. The absence of such a benchmark leads to insufficient and misleading model evaluations, severely undermining the development of this field. However, the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and inconsistent training and evaluation protocols make conducting rigorous experiments and faithful comparisons among IMDL models challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive IMDL benchmark and modular codebase. IMDL-BenCo:~\textbf{i)} decomposes the IMDL framework into standardized, reusable components and revises the model construction pipeline, improving coding efficiency and customization flexibility;~\textbf{ii)} fully implements or incorporates training code for state-of-the-art models to establish a comprehensive IMDL benchmark; and~\textbf{iii)} conducts deep analysis based on the established benchmark and codebase, offering new insights into IMDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. Specifically, IMDL-BenCo includes common processing algorithms, 8 state-of-the-art IMDL models (1 of which are reproduced from scratch), 2 sets of standard training and evaluation protocols, 15 GPU-accelerated evaluation metrics, and 3 kinds of robustness evaluation. This benchmark and codebase represent a significant leap forward in calibrating the current progress in the IMDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

      <title>CrossFuse: A Novel Cross Attention Mechanism based Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal visual information fusion aims to integrate the multi-sensor data into a single image which contains more complementary information and less redundant features. However the complementary information is hard to extract, especially for infrared and visible images which contain big similarity gap between these two modalities. The common cross attention modules only consider the correlation, on the contrary, image fusion tasks need focus on complementarity (uncorrelation). Hence, in this paper, a novel cross attention mechanism (CAM) is proposed to enhance the complementary information. Furthermore, a two-stage training strategy based fusion scheme is presented to generate the fused images. For the first stage, two auto-encoder networks with same architecture are trained for each modality. Then, with the fixed encoders, the CAM and a decoder are trained in the second stage. With the trained CAM, features extracted from two modalities are integrated into one fused feature in which the complementary information is enhanced and the redundant features are reduced. Finally, the fused image can be generated by the trained decoder. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed fusion method obtains the SOTA fusion performance compared with the existing fusion networks.

      <title>SparseRadNet: Sparse Perception Neural Network on Subsampled Radar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10600v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based perception has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving, yet the inherent sparsity of radars poses challenges. Radar raw data often contains excessive noise, whereas radar point clouds retain only limited information. In this work, we holistically treat the sparse nature of radar data by introducing an adaptive subsampling method together with a tailored network architecture that exploits the sparsity patterns to discover global and local dependencies in the radar signal. Our subsampling module selects a subset of pixels from range-doppler (RD) spectra that contribute most to the downstream perception tasks. To improve the feature extraction on sparse subsampled data, we propose a new way of applying graph neural networks on radar data and design a novel two-branch backbone to capture both global and local neighbor information. An attentive fusion module is applied to combine features from both branches. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our SparseRadNet exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in object detection and achieves close to SOTA accuracy in freespace segmentation, meanwhile using sparse subsampled input data.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Details: StyleFeatureEditor for Detail-Rich StyleGAN Inversion and High Quality Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of manipulating real image attributes through StyleGAN inversion has been extensively researched. This process involves searching latent variables from a well-trained StyleGAN generator that can synthesize a real image, modifying these latent variables, and then synthesizing an image with the desired edits. A balance must be struck between the quality of the reconstruction and the ability to edit. Earlier studies utilized the low-dimensional W-space for latent search, which facilitated effective editing but struggled with reconstructing intricate details. More recent research has turned to the high-dimensional feature space F, which successfully inverses the input image but loses much of the detail during editing. In this paper, we introduce StyleFeatureEditor -- a novel method that enables editing in both w-latents and F-latents. This technique not only allows for the reconstruction of finer image details but also ensures their preservation during editing. We also present a new training pipeline specifically designed to train our model to accurately edit F-latents. Our method is compared with state-of-the-art encoding approaches, demonstrating that our model excels in terms of reconstruction quality and is capable of editing even challenging out-of-domain examples.

      <title>Enhancing Anomaly Detection Generalization through Knowledge Exposure: The Dual Effects of Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection involves identifying instances within a dataset that deviate from the norm and occur infrequently. Current benchmarks tend to favor methods biased towards low diversity in normal data, which does not align with real-world scenarios. Despite advancements in these benchmarks, contemporary anomaly detection methods often struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, particularly in classifying samples with subtle transformations during testing. These methods typically assume that normal samples during test time have distributions very similar to those in the training set, while anomalies are distributed much further away. However, real-world test samples often exhibit various levels of distribution shift while maintaining semantic consistency. Therefore, effectively generalizing to samples that have undergone semantic-preserving transformations, while accurately detecting normal samples whose semantic meaning has changed after transformation as anomalies, is crucial for the trustworthiness and reliability of a model. For example, although it is clear that rotation shifts the meaning for a car in the context of anomaly detection but preserves the meaning for a bird, current methods are likely to detect both as abnormal. This complexity underscores the necessity for dynamic learning procedures rooted in the intrinsic concept of outliers. To address this issue, we propose new testing protocols and a novel method called Knowledge Exposure (KE), which integrates external knowledge to comprehend concept dynamics and differentiate transformations that induce semantic shifts. This approach enhances generalization by utilizing insights from a pre-trained CLIP model to evaluate the significance of anomalies for each concept. Evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN with the new protocols demonstrates superior performance compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Public Computer Vision Datasets for Precision Livestock Farming: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technology-driven precision livestock farming (PLF) empowers practitioners to monitor and analyze animal growth and health conditions for improved productivity and welfare. Computer vision (CV) is indispensable in PLF by using cameras and computer algorithms to supplement or supersede manual efforts for livestock data acquisition. Data availability is crucial for developing innovative monitoring and analysis systems through artificial intelligence-based techniques. However, data curation processes are tedious, time-consuming, and resource intensive. This study presents the first systematic survey of publicly available livestock CV datasets (https://github.com/Anil-Bhujel/Public-Computer-Vision-Dataset-A-Systematic-Survey). Among 58 public datasets identified and analyzed, encompassing different species of livestock, almost half of them are for cattle, followed by swine, poultry, and other animals. Individual animal detection and color imaging are the dominant application and imaging modality for livestock. The characteristics and baseline applications of the datasets are discussed, emphasizing the implications for animal welfare advocates. Challenges and opportunities are also discussed to inspire further efforts in developing livestock CV datasets. This study highlights that the limited quantity of high-quality annotated datasets collected from diverse environments, animals, and applications, the absence of contextual metadata, are a real bottleneck in PLF.</description>

      <title>fNeRF: High Quality Radiance Fields from Practical Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of Neural Radiance Fields has enabled a previously unseen level of photo-realistic 3D reconstruction of scenes and objects from multi-view camera data. However, previous methods use an oversimplified pinhole camera model resulting in defocus blur being `baked' into the reconstructed radiance field. We propose a modification to the ray casting that leverages the optics of lenses to enhance scene reconstruction in the presence of defocus blur. This allows us to improve the quality of radiance field reconstructions from the measurements of a practical camera with finite aperture. We show that the proposed model matches the defocus blur behavior of practical cameras more closely than pinhole models and other approximations of defocus blur models, particularly in the presence of partial occlusions. This allows us to achieve sharper reconstructions, improving the PSNR on validation of all-in-focus images, on both synthetic and real datasets, by up to 3 dB.</description>

      <title>Seeing Clearly, Answering Incorrectly: A Multimodal Robustness Benchmark for Evaluating MLLMs on Leading Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning, providing sightly reasonable answers, such as image descriptions. This has spurred extensive research on the evaluation of MLLMs. Most evaluation benchmarks assume that incorrect answers indicate a lack of understanding of the visual content. However, our findings reveal that, in many cases, MLLMs answer questions incorrectly despite correctly understanding the visual content. This suggests that incorrect answers do not necessarily imply a lack of comprehension but may instead result from lacking robustness to leading questions. To comprehensively measure MLLMs' understanding capability and robustness to leading questions, we introduce a MultiModal Robustness benchmark (MMR). MMR contains paired positive and negative questions across 12 categories, meticulously annotated by humans. We evaluate 18 leading MLLMs on the MMB benchmark, revealing that MLLMs suffer from fragility to leading questions despite understanding the visual content. To enhance MLLMs' understanding capability and robustness, we further present a training set with paired positive and negative visual question-answer samples. Experiments verify that MLLMs' robustness can be significantly enhanced by tuning on this new training set. The benchmark, training set, and code can be found at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/Multimodal-Robustness-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>MDeRainNet: An Efficient Neural Network for Rain Streak Removal from Macro-pixel Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since rainy weather always degrades image quality and poses significant challenges to most computer vision-based intelligent systems, image de-raining has been a hot research topic. Fortunately, in a rainy light field (LF) image, background obscured by rain streaks in one sub-view may be visible in the other sub-views, and implicit depth information and recorded 4D structural information may benefit rain streak detection and removal. However, existing LF image rain removal methods either do not fully exploit the global correlations of 4D LF data or only utilize partial sub-views, resulting in sub-optimal rain removal performance and no-equally good quality for all de-rained sub-views. In this paper, we propose an efficient network, called MDeRainNet, for rain streak removal from LF images. The proposed network adopts a multi-scale encoder-decoder architecture, which directly works on Macro-pixel images (MPIs) to improve the rain removal performance. To fully model the global correlation between the spatial and the angular information, we propose an Extended Spatial-Angular Interaction (ESAI) module to merge them, in which a simple and effective Transformer-based Spatial-Angular Interaction Attention (SAIA) block is also proposed for modeling long-range geometric correlations and making full use of the angular information. Furthermore, to improve the generalization performance of our network on real-world rainy scenes, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for our MDeRainNet, which utilizes multi-level KL loss to bridge the domain gap between features of synthetic and real-world rain streaks and introduces colored-residue image guided contrastive regularization to reconstruct rain-free images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world LFIs demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>SemanticMIM: Marring Masked Image Modeling with Semantics Compression for General Visual Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper represents a neat yet effective framework, named SemanticMIM, to integrate the advantages of masked image modeling (MIM) and contrastive learning (CL) for general visual representation. We conduct a thorough comparative analysis between CL and MIM, revealing that their complementary advantages fundamentally stem from two distinct phases, i.e., compression and reconstruction. Specifically, SemanticMIM leverages a proxy architecture that customizes interaction between image and mask tokens, bridging these two phases to achieve general visual representation with the property of abundant semantic and positional awareness. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that SemanticMIM effectively amalgamates the benefits of CL and MIM, leading to significant enhancement of performance and feature linear separability. SemanticMIM also offers notable interpretability through attention response visualization. Codes are available at https://github.com/yyk-wew/SemanticMIM.</description>

      <title>A Late-Stage Bitemporal Feature Fusion Network for Semantic Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic change detection is an important task in geoscience and earth observation. By producing a semantic change map for each temporal phase, both the land use land cover categories and change information can be interpreted. Recently some multi-task learning based semantic change detection methods have been proposed to decompose the task into semantic segmentation and binary change detection subtasks. However, previous works comprise triple branches in an entangled manner, which may not be optimal and hard to adopt foundation models. Besides, lacking explicit refinement of bitemporal features during fusion may cause low accuracy. In this letter, we propose a novel late-stage bitemporal feature fusion network to address the issue. Specifically, we propose local global attentional aggregation module to strengthen feature fusion, and propose local global context enhancement module to highlight pivotal semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, including SECOND and Landsat-SCD. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank Deconvolution (LRD) has appeared as a new multi-dimensional representation model that enjoys important efficiency and flexibility properties. In this work we ask ourselves if this analytical model can compete against Deep Learning (DL) frameworks like Deep Image Prior (DIP) or Blind-Spot Networks (BSN) and other classical methods in the task of signal restoration. More specifically, we propose to extend LRD with differential regularization. This approach allows us to easily incorporate Total Variation (TV) and integral priors to the formulation leading to considerable performance tested on signal restoration tasks such image denoising and video enhancement, and at the same time benefiting from its small computational cost.</description>

      <title>Voxel Mamba: Group-Free State Space Models for Point Cloud based 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10700v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serialization-based methods, which serialize the 3D voxels and group them into multiple sequences before inputting to Transformers, have demonstrated their effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, serializing 3D voxels into 1D sequences will inevitably sacrifice the voxel spatial proximity. Such an issue is hard to be addressed by enlarging the group size with existing serialization-based methods due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers with feature sizes. Inspired by the recent advances of state space models (SSMs), we present a Voxel SSM, termed as Voxel Mamba, which employs a group-free strategy to serialize the whole space of voxels into a single sequence. The linear complexity of SSMs encourages our group-free design, alleviating the loss of spatial proximity of voxels. To further enhance the spatial proximity, we propose a Dual-scale SSM Block to establish a hierarchical structure, enabling a larger receptive field in the 1D serialization curve, as well as more complete local regions in 3D space. Moreover, we implicitly apply window partition under the group-free framework by positional encoding, which further enhances spatial proximity by encoding voxel positional information. Our experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset show that Voxel Mamba not only achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, but also demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with an extensive list of automotive radar datasets that support autonomous driving, indoor radar datasets are scarce at a smaller scale in the format of low-resolution radar point clouds and usually under an open-space single-room setting. In this paper, we scale up indoor radar data collection using multi-view high-resolution radar heatmap in a multi-day, multi-room, and multi-subject setting, with an emphasis on the diversity of environment and subjects. Referred to as the millimeter-wave multi-view radar (MMVR) dataset, it consists of $345$K multi-view radar frames collected from $25$ human subjects over $6$ different rooms, $446$K annotated bounding boxes/segmentation instances, and $7.59$ million annotated keypoints to support three major perception tasks of object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation, respectively. For each task, we report performance benchmarks under two protocols: a single subject in an open space and multiple subjects in several cluttered rooms with two data splits: random split and cross-environment split over $395$ 1-min data segments. We anticipate that MMVR facilitates indoor radar perception development for indoor vehicle (robot/humanoid) navigation, building energy management, and elderly care for better efficiency, user experience, and safety.</description>

      <title>Object Detection using Oriented Window Learning Vi-sion Transformer: Roadway Assets Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection is a critical component of transportation systems, particularly for applications such as autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance. Traditional object detection methods often struggle with limited data and variability in object appearance. The Oriented Window Learning Vision Transformer (OWL-ViT) offers a novel approach by adapting window orientations to the geometry and existence of objects, making it highly suitable for detecting diverse roadway assets. This study leverages OWL-ViT within a one-shot learning framework to recognize transportation infrastructure components, such as traffic signs, poles, pavement, and cracks. This study presents a novel method for roadway asset detection using OWL-ViT. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of detection consistency, semantic flexibility, visual context adaptability, resolution robustness, and impact of non-max suppression. The results demonstrate the high efficiency and reliability of the OWL-ViT across various scenarios, underscoring its potential to enhance the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>GenMM: Geometrically and Temporally Consistent Multimodal Data Generation for Video and LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal synthetic data generation is crucial in domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, augmented/virtual reality, and retail. We propose a novel approach, GenMM, for jointly editing RGB videos and LiDAR scans by inserting temporally and geometrically consistent 3D objects. Our method uses a reference image and 3D bounding boxes to seamlessly insert and blend new objects into target videos. We inpaint the 2D Regions of Interest (consistent with 3D boxes) using a diffusion-based video inpainting model. We then compute semantic boundaries of the object and estimate it's surface depth using state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation techniques. Subsequently, we employ a geometry-based optimization algorithm to recover the 3D shape of the object's surface, ensuring it fits precisely within the 3D bounding box. Finally, LiDAR rays intersecting with the new object surface are updated to reflect consistent depths with its geometry. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenMM in inserting various 3D objects across video and LiDAR modalities.</description>

      <title>Eye in the Sky: Detection and Compliance Monitoring of Brick Kilns using Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. The brick manufacturing industry accounts for 8%-14% of air pollution in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plain. Due to the unorganized nature of brick kilns, policy violation detection, such as proximity to human habitats, remains challenging. While previous studies have utilized computer vision-based machine learning methods for brick kiln detection from satellite imagery, they utilize proprietary satellite data and rarely focus on compliance with government policies. In this research, we introduce a scalable framework for brick kiln detection and automatic compliance monitoring. We use Google Maps Static API to download the satellite imagery followed by the YOLOv8x model for detection. We identified and hand-verified 19579 new brick kilns across 9 states within the Indo-Gangetic plain. Furthermore, we automate and test the compliance to the policies affecting human habitats, rivers and hospitals. Our results show that a substantial number of brick kilns do not meet the compliance requirements. Our framework offers a valuable tool for governments worldwide to automate and enforce policy regulations for brick kilns, addressing critical environmental and public health concerns.</description>

      <title>FreeMotion: MoCap-Free Human Motion Synthesis with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion synthesis is a fundamental task in computer animation. Despite recent progress in this field utilizing deep learning and motion capture data, existing methods are always limited to specific motion categories, environments, and styles. This poor generalizability can be partially attributed to the difficulty and expense of collecting large-scale and high-quality motion data. At the same time, foundation models trained with internet-scale image and text data have demonstrated surprising world knowledge and reasoning ability for various downstream tasks. Utilizing these foundation models may help with human motion synthesis, which some recent works have superficially explored. However, these methods didn't fully unveil the foundation models' potential for this task and only support several simple actions and environments. In this paper, we for the first time, without any motion data, explore open-set human motion synthesis using natural language instructions as user control signals based on MLLMs across any motion task and environment. Our framework can be split into two stages: 1) sequential keyframe generation by utilizing MLLMs as a keyframe designer and animator; 2) motion filling between keyframes through interpolation and motion tracking. Our method can achieve general human motion synthesis for many downstream tasks. The promising results demonstrate the worth of mocap-free human motion synthesis aided by MLLMs and pave the way for future research.</description>

      <title>Spuriousness-Aware Meta-Learning for Learning Robust Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious correlations are brittle associations between certain attributes of inputs and target variables, such as the correlation between an image background and an object class. Deep image classifiers often leverage them for predictions, leading to poor generalization on the data where the correlations do not hold. Mitigating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial towards robust model generalization, but it often requires annotations of the spurious correlations in data -- a strong assumption in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework based on meta-learning, termed SPUME -- SPUriousness-aware MEta-learning, to train an image classifier to be robust to spurious correlations. We design the framework to iteratively detect and mitigate the spurious correlations that the classifier excessively relies on for predictions. To achieve this, we first propose to utilize a pre-trained vision-language model to extract text-format attributes from images. These attributes enable us to curate data with various class-attribute correlations, and we formulate a novel metric to measure the degree of these correlations' spuriousness. Then, to mitigate the reliance on spurious correlations, we propose a meta-learning strategy in which the support (training) sets and query (test) sets in tasks are curated with different spurious correlations that have high degrees of spuriousness. By meta-training the classifier on these spuriousness-aware meta-learning tasks, our classifier can learn to be invariant to the spurious correlations. We demonstrate that our method is robust to spurious correlations without knowing them a priori and achieves the best on five benchmark datasets with different robustness measures.</description>

Abstract: The intersection of physics-based vision and deep learning presents an exciting frontier for advancing computer vision technologies. By leveraging the principles of physics to inform and enhance deep learning models, we can develop more robust and accurate vision systems. Physics-based vision aims to invert the processes to recover scene properties such as shape, reflectance, light distribution, and medium properties from images. In recent years, deep learning has shown promising improvements for various vision tasks, and when combined with physics-based vision, these approaches can enhance the robustness and accuracy of vision systems. This technical report summarizes the outcomes of the Physics-Based Vision Meets Deep Learning (PBDL) 2024 challenge, held in CVPR 2024 workshop. The challenge consisted of eight tracks, focusing on Low-Light Enhancement and Detection as well as High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging. This report details the objectives, methodologies, and results of each track, highlighting the top-performing solutions and their innovative approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Traffic Crashes as Language: Datasets, Benchmarks, and What-if Causal Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing rate of road accidents worldwide results not only in significant loss of life but also imposes billions financial burdens on societies. Current research in traffic crash frequency modeling and analysis has predominantly approached the problem as classification tasks, focusing mainly on learning-based classification or ensemble learning methods. These approaches often overlook the intricate relationships among the complex infrastructure, environmental, human and contextual factors related to traffic crashes and risky situations. In contrast, we initially propose a large-scale traffic crash language dataset, named CrashEvent, summarizing 19,340 real-world crash reports and incorporating infrastructure data, environmental and traffic textual and visual information in Washington State. Leveraging this rich dataset, we further formulate the crash event feature learning as a novel text reasoning problem and further fine-tune various large language models (LLMs) to predict detailed accident outcomes, such as crash types, severity and number of injuries, based on contextual and environmental factors. The proposed model, CrashLLM, distinguishes itself from existing solutions by leveraging the inherent text reasoning capabilities of LLMs to parse and learn from complex, unstructured data, thereby enabling a more nuanced analysis of contributing factors. Our experiments results shows that our LLM-based approach not only predicts the severity of accidents but also classifies different types of accidents and predicts injury outcomes, all with averaged F1 score boosted from 34.9% to 53.8%. Furthermore, CrashLLM can provide valuable insights for numerous open-world what-if situational-awareness traffic safety analyses with learned reasoning features, which existing models cannot offer. We make our benchmark, datasets, and model public available for further exploration.</description>

      <title>STAR: Scale-wise Text-to-image generation via Auto-Regressive representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STAR, a text-to-image model that employs scale-wise auto-regressive paradigm. Unlike VAR, which is limited to class-conditioned synthesis within a fixed set of predetermined categories, our STAR enables text-driven open-set generation through three key designs: To boost diversity and generalizability with unseen combinations of objects and concepts, we introduce a pre-trained text encoder to extract representations for textual constraints, which we then use as guidance. To improve the interactions between generated images and fine-grained textual guidance, making results more controllable, additional cross-attention layers are incorporated at each scale. Given the natural structure correlation across different scales, we leverage 2D Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) and tweak it into a normalized version. This ensures consistent interpretation of relative positions across token maps at different scales and stabilizes the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses existing benchmarks in terms of fidelity,image text consistency, and aesthetic quality. Our findings emphasize the potential of auto-regressive methods in the field of high-quality image synthesis, offering promising new directions for the T2I field currently dominated by diffusion methods.</description>

      <title>Saliency-guided and Patch-based Mixup for Long-tailed Skin Cancer Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image datasets often exhibit long-tailed distributions due to the inherent challenges in medical data collection and annotation. In long-tailed contexts, some common disease categories account for most of the data, while only a few samples are available in the rare disease categories, resulting in poor performance of deep learning methods. To address this issue, previous approaches have employed class re-sampling or re-weighting techniques, which often encounter challenges such as overfitting to tail classes or difficulties in optimization during training. In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{S}aliency-guided and \textbf{P}atch-based \textbf{Mix}up (SPMix) for long-tailed skin cancer image classification. Specifically, given a tail-class image and a head-class image, we generate a new tail-class image by mixing them under the guidance of saliency mapping, which allows for preserving and augmenting the discriminative features of the tail classes without any interference of the head-class features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ISIC2018 dataset, demonstrating the superiority of SPMix over existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>GUI-WORLD: A Dataset for GUI-oriented Multimodal LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding code. However, current agents primarily exhibit excellent understanding capabilities in static environments and are predominantly applied in relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that ImageLLMs struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, VideoLLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Based on GUI-World, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned VideoLLM as a GUI agent, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using VideoLLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding. The code and dataset are publicly available at our project homepage: https://gui-world.github.io/.</description>

      <title>PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg.</description>

      <title>Reminding Multimodal Large Language Models of Object-aware Knowledge with Retrieved Tags</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in the general visual instruction-following ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they still struggle with critical problems when required to provide a precise and detailed response to a visual instruction: (1) failure to identify novel objects or entities, (2) mention of non-existent objects, and (3) neglect of object's attributed details. Intuitive solutions include improving the size and quality of data or using larger foundation models. They show effectiveness in mitigating these issues, but at an expensive cost of collecting a vast amount of new data and introducing a significantly larger model. Standing at the intersection of these approaches, we examine the three object-oriented problems from the perspective of the image-to-text mapping process by the multimodal connector. In this paper, we first identify the limitations of multimodal connectors stemming from insufficient training data. Driven by this, we propose to enhance the mapping with retrieval-augmented tag tokens, which contain rich object-aware information such as object names and attributes. With our Tag-grounded visual instruction tuning with retrieval Augmentation (TUNA), we outperform baselines that share the same language model and training data on 12 benchmarks. Furthermore, we show the zero-shot capability of TUNA when provided with specific datastores.</description>

      <title>LAIP: Learning Local Alignment from Image-Phrase Modeling for Text-based Person Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based person search aims at retrieving images of a particular person based on a given textual description. A common solution for this task is to directly match the entire images and texts, i.e., global alignment, which fails to deal with discerning specific details that discriminate against appearance-similar people. As a result, some works shift their attention towards local alignment. One group matches fine-grained parts using forward attention weights of the transformer yet underutilizes information. Another implicitly conducts local alignment by reconstructing masked parts based on unmasked context yet with a biased masking strategy. All limit performance improvement. This paper proposes the Local Alignment from Image-Phrase modeling (LAIP) framework, with Bidirectional Attention-weighted local alignment (BidirAtt) and Mask Phrase Modeling (MPM) module.BidirAtt goes beyond the typical forward attention by considering the gradient of the transformer as backward attention, utilizing two-sided information for local alignment. MPM focuses on mask reconstruction within the noun phrase rather than the entire text, ensuring an unbiased masking strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets demonstrate the superiority of the LAIP framework over existing methods.</description>

      <title>IG2: Integrated Gradient on Iterative Gradient Path for Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature attribution explains Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the instance level by providing importance scores of input features' contributions to model prediction. Integrated Gradients (IG) is a prominent path attribution method for deep neural networks, involving the integration of gradients along a path from the explained input (explicand) to a counterfactual instance (baseline). Current IG variants primarily focus on the gradient of explicand's output. However, our research indicates that the gradient of the counterfactual output significantly affects feature attribution as well. To achieve this, we propose Iterative Gradient path Integrated Gradients (IG2), considering both gradients. IG2 incorporates the counterfactual gradient iteratively into the integration path, generating a novel path (GradPath) and a novel baseline (GradCF). These two novel IG components effectively address the issues of attribution noise and arbitrary baseline choice in earlier IG methods. IG2, as a path method, satisfies many desirable axioms, which are theoretically justified in the paper. Experimental results on XAI benchmark, ImageNet, MNIST, TREC questions answering, wafer-map failure patterns, and CelebA face attributes validate that IG2 delivers superior feature attributions compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. The code is released at: https://github.com/JoeZhuo-ZY/IG2.</description>

      <title>MV2Cyl: Reconstructing 3D Extrusion Cylinders from Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MV2Cyl, a novel method for reconstructing 3D from 2D multi-view images, not merely as a field or raw geometry but as a sketch-extrude CAD model. Extracting extrusion cylinders from raw 3D geometry has been extensively researched in computer vision, while the processing of 3D data through neural networks has remained a bottleneck. Since 3D scans are generally accompanied by multi-view images, leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks allows these images to be exploited as a rich source for extracting extrusion cylinder information. However, we observe that extracting only the surface information of the extrudes and utilizing it results in suboptimal outcomes due to the challenges in the occlusion and surface segmentation. By synergizing with the extracted base curve information, we achieve the optimal reconstruction result with the best accuracy in 2D sketch and extrude parameter estimation. Our experiments, comparing our method with previous work that takes a raw 3D point cloud as input, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by taking advantage of multi-view images.</description>

      <title>ALPS: An Auto-Labeling and Pre-training Scheme for Remote Sensing Segmentation With Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fast-growing field of Remote Sensing (RS) image analysis, the gap between massive unlabeled datasets and the ability to fully utilize these datasets for advanced RS analytics presents a significant challenge. To fill the gap, our work introduces an innovative auto-labeling framework named ALPS (Automatic Labeling for Pre-training in Segmentation), leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to predict precise pseudo-labels for RS images without necessitating prior annotations or additional prompts. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces the labor and resource demands traditionally associated with annotating RS datasets. By constructing two comprehensive pseudo-labeled RS datasets via ALPS for pre-training purposes, our approach enhances the performance of downstream tasks across various benchmarks, including iSAID and ISPRS Potsdam. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to generalize well across multiple tasks even under the scarcity of extensively annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution to automatic segmentation and annotation challenges in the field. In addition, the proposed a pipeline is flexible and can be applied to medical image segmentation, remarkably boosting the performance. Note that ALPS utilizes pre-trained SAM to semi-automatically annotate RS images without additional manual annotations. Though every component in the pipeline has bee well explored, integrating clustering algorithms with SAM and novel pseudo-label alignment significantly enhances RS segmentation, as an off-the-shelf tool for pre-training data preparation.

      <title>Imperceptible Face Forgery Attack via Adversarial Semantic Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the great development of generative model techniques, face forgery detection draws more and more attention in the related field. Researchers find that existing face forgery models are still vulnerable to adversarial examples with generated pixel perturbations in the global image. These generated adversarial samples still can't achieve satisfactory performance because of the high detectability. To address these problems, we propose an Adversarial Semantic Mask Attack framework (ASMA) which can generate adversarial examples with good transferability and invisibility. Specifically, we propose a novel adversarial semantic mask generative model, which can constrain generated perturbations in local semantic regions for good stealthiness. The designed adaptive semantic mask selection strategy can effectively leverage the class activation values of different semantic regions, and further ensure better attack transferability and stealthiness. Extensive experiments on the public face forgery dataset prove the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with several representative adversarial attack methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/clawerO-O/ASMA.</description>

      <title>VELOCITI: Can Video-Language Models Bind Semantic Concepts through Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionality is a fundamental aspect of vision-language understanding and is especially required for videos since they contain multiple entities (e.g. persons, actions, and scenes) interacting dynamically over time. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on perception capabilities. However, they do not study binding, the ability of a model to associate entities through appropriate relationships. To this end, we propose VELOCITI, a new benchmark building on complex movie clips and dense semantic role label annotations to test perception and binding in video language models (contrastive and Video-LLMs). Our perception-based tests require discriminating video-caption pairs that share similar entities, and the binding tests require models to associate the correct entity to a given situation while ignoring the different yet plausible entities that also appear in the same video. While current state-of-the-art models perform moderately well on perception tests, accuracy is near random when both entities are present in the same video, indicating that they fail at binding tests. Even the powerful Gemini 1.5 Flash has a substantial gap (16-28%) with respect to human accuracy in such binding tests.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Label Noise in Instance Segmentation: Spatial Noise Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10891v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate labels for instance segmentation is particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the task. Each image necessitates multiple annotations, encompassing not only the object's class but also its precise spatial boundaries. These requirements elevate the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in both manual and automated annotation processes. By simulating different noise conditions, we provide a realistic scenario for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of instance segmentation models in different segmentation tasks, introducing COCO-N and Cityscapes-N. We also propose a benchmark for weakly annotation noise, dubbed COCO-WAN, which utilizes foundation models and weak annotations to simulate semi-automated annotation tools and their noisy labels. This study sheds light on the quality of segmentation masks produced by various models and challenges the efficacy of popular methods designed to address learning with label noise.</description>

      <title>AUTOHALLUSION: Automatic Generation of Hallucination Benchmarks for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) hallucinate: certain context cues in an image may trigger the language module's overconfident and incorrect reasoning on abnormal or hypothetical objects. Though a few benchmarks have been developed to investigate LVLM hallucinations, they mainly rely on hand-crafted corner cases whose fail patterns may hardly generalize, and finetuning on them could undermine their validity. These motivate us to develop the first automatic benchmark generation approach, AUTOHALLUSION, that harnesses a few principal strategies to create diverse hallucination examples. It probes the language modules in LVLMs for context cues and uses them to synthesize images by: (1) adding objects abnormal to the context cues; (2) for two co-occurring objects, keeping one and excluding the other; or (3) removing objects closely tied to the context cues. It then generates image-based questions whose ground-truth answers contradict the language module's prior. A model has to overcome contextual biases and distractions to reach correct answers, while incorrect or inconsistent answers indicate hallucinations. AUTOHALLUSION enables us to create new benchmarks at the minimum cost and thus overcomes the fragility of hand-crafted benchmarks. It also reveals common failure patterns and reasons, providing key insights to detect, avoid, or control hallucinations. Comprehensive evaluations of top-tier LVLMs, e.g., GPT-4V(ision), Gemini Pro Vision, Claude 3, and LLaVA-1.5, show a 97.7% and 98.7% success rate of hallucination induction on synthetic and real-world datasets of AUTOHALLUSION, paving the way for a long battle against hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Light Up the Shadows: Enhance Long-Tailed Entity Grounding with Concept-Guided Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) have proven valuable for various downstream tasks. However, scaling them up is challenging because building large-scale MMKGs often introduces mismatched images (i.e., noise). Most entities in KGs belong to the long tail, meaning there are few images of them available online. This scarcity makes it difficult to determine whether a found image matches the entity. To address this, we draw on the Triangle of Reference Theory and suggest enhancing vision-language models with concept guidance. Specifically, we introduce COG, a two-stage framework with COncept-Guided vision-language models. The framework comprises a Concept Integration module, which effectively identifies image-text pairs of long-tailed entities, and an Evidence Fusion module, which offers explainability and enables human verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COG, we create a dataset of 25k image-text pairs of long-tailed entities. Our comprehensive experiments show that COG not only improves the accuracy of recognizing long-tailed image-text pairs compared to baselines but also offers flexibility and explainability.</description>

      <title>SparseDet: A Simple and Effective Framework for Fully Sparse LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based sparse 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications due to its computational efficiency advantages. Existing methods either use the features of a single central voxel as an object proxy, or treat an aggregated cluster of foreground points as an object proxy. However, the former lacks the ability to aggregate contextual information, resulting in insufficient information expression in object proxies. The latter relies on multi-stage pipelines and auxiliary tasks, which reduce the inference speed. To maintain the efficiency of the sparse framework while fully aggregating contextual information, in this work, we propose SparseDet which designs sparse queries as object proxies. It introduces two key modules, the Local Multi-scale Feature Aggregation (LMFA) module and the Global Feature Aggregation (GFA) module, aiming to fully capture the contextual information, thereby enhancing the ability of the proxies to represent objects. Where LMFA sub-module achieves feature fusion across different scales for sparse key voxels %which does this through via coordinate transformations and using nearest neighbor relationships to capture object-level details and local contextual information, GFA sub-module uses self-attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate the features of the key voxels across the entire scene for capturing scene-level contextual information. Experiments on nuScenes and KITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on nuScene, SparseDet surpasses the previous best sparse detector VoxelNeXt by 2.2\% mAP with 13.5 FPS, and on KITTI, it surpasses VoxelNeXt by 1.12\% $\mathbf{AP_{3D}}$ on hard level tasks with 17.9 FPS.</description>

      <title>Investigating Video Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models with Tropes in Movies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness not only in language tasks but also in video reasoning. This paper introduces a novel dataset, Tropes in Movies (TiM), designed as a testbed for exploring two critical yet previously overlooked video reasoning skills: (1) Abstract Perception: understanding and tokenizing abstract concepts in videos, and (2) Long-range Compositional Reasoning: planning and integrating intermediate reasoning steps for understanding long-range videos with numerous frames. Utilizing tropes from movie storytelling, TiM evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches. Our experiments show that current methods, including Captioner-Reasoner, Large Multimodal Model Instruction Fine-tuning, and Visual Programming, only marginally outperform a random baseline when tackling the challenges of Abstract Perception and Long-range Compositional Reasoning. To address these deficiencies, we propose Face-Enhanced Viper of Role Interactions (FEVoRI) and Context Query Reduction (ConQueR), which enhance Visual Programming by fostering role interaction awareness and progressively refining movie contexts and trope queries during reasoning processes, significantly improving performance by 15 F1 points. However, this performance still lags behind human levels (40 vs. 65 F1). Additionally, we introduce a new protocol to evaluate the necessity of Abstract Perception and Long-range Compositional Reasoning for task resolution. This is done by analyzing the code generated through Visual Programming using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), thereby confirming the increased complexity of TiM. The dataset and code are available at: https://ander1119.github.io/TiM</description>

      <title>Improving Adversarial Robustness via Decoupled Visual Representation Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are proven to be vulnerable to fine-designed adversarial examples, and adversarial defense algorithms draw more and more attention nowadays. Pre-processing based defense is a major strategy, as well as learning robust feature representation has been proven an effective way to boost generalization. However, existing defense works lack considering different depth-level visual features in the training process. In this paper, we first highlight two novel properties of robust features from the feature distribution perspective: 1) \textbf{Diversity}. The robust feature of intra-class samples can maintain appropriate diversity; 2) \textbf{Discriminability}. The robust feature of inter-class samples should ensure adequate separation. We find that state-of-the-art defense methods aim to address both of these mentioned issues well. It motivates us to increase intra-class variance and decrease inter-class discrepancy simultaneously in adversarial training. Specifically, we propose a simple but effective defense based on decoupled visual representation masking. The designed Decoupled Visual Feature Masking (DFM) block can adaptively disentangle visual discriminative features and non-visual features with diverse mask strategies, while the suitable discarding information can disrupt adversarial noise to improve robustness. Our work provides a generic and easy-to-plugin block unit for any former adversarial training algorithm to achieve better protection integrally. Extensive experimental results prove the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art defense approaches.

      <title>Pick-or-Mix: Dynamic Channel Sampling for ConvNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel pruning approaches for convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) deactivate the channels, statically or dynamically, and require special implementation. In addition, channel squeezing in representative ConvNets is carried out via 1x1 convolutions which dominates a large portion of computations and network parameters. Given these challenges, we propose an effective multi-purpose module for dynamic channel sampling, namely Pick-or-Mix (PiX), which does not require special implementation. PiX divides a set of channels into subsets and then picks from them, where the picking decision is dynamically made per each pixel based on the input activations. We plug PiX into prominent ConvNet architectures and verify its multi-purpose utilities. After replacing 1x1 channel squeezing layers in ResNet with PiX, the network becomes 25% faster without losing accuracy. We show that PiX allows ConvNets to learn better data representation than widely adopted approaches to enhance networks' representation power (e.g., SE, CBAM, AFF, SKNet, and DWP). We also show that PiX achieves state-of-the-art performance on network downscaling and dynamic channel pruning applications.</description>

      <title>Rectified Iterative Disparity for Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both uncertainty-assisted and iteration-based methods have achieved great success in stereo matching. However, existing uncertainty estimation methods take a single image and the corresponding disparity as input, which imposes higher demands on the estimation network. In this paper, we propose Cost volume-based disparity Uncertainty Estimation (UEC). Based on the rich similarity information in the cost volume coming from the image pairs, the proposed UEC can achieve competitive performance with low computational cost. Secondly, we propose two methods of uncertainty-assisted disparity estimation, Uncertainty-based Disparity Rectification (UDR) and Uncertainty-based Disparity update Conditioning (UDC). These two methods optimise the disparity update process of the iterative-based approach without adding extra parameters. In addition, we propose Disparity Rectification loss that significantly improves the accuracy of small amount of disparity updates. We present a high-performance stereo architecture, DR Stereo, which is a combination of the proposed methods. Experimental results from SceneFlow, KITTI, Middlebury 2014, and ETH3D show that DR-Stereo achieves very competitive disparity estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary X-ray Prohibited Item Detection via Fine-tuning CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray prohibited item detection is an essential component of security check and categories of prohibited item are continuously increasing in accordance with the latest laws. Previous works all focus on close-set scenarios, which can only recognize known categories used for training and often require time-consuming as well as labor-intensive annotations when learning novel categories, resulting in limited real-world applications. Although the success of vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) provides a new perspectives for open-set X-ray prohibited item detection, directly applying CLIP to X-ray domain leads to a sharp performance drop due to domain shift between X-ray data and general data used for pre-training CLIP. To address aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we introduce distillation-based open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) task into X-ray security inspection domain by extending CLIP to learn visual representations in our specific X-ray domain, aiming to detect novel prohibited item categories beyond base categories on which the detector is trained. Specifically, we propose X-ray feature adapter and apply it to CLIP within OVOD framework to develop OVXD model. X-ray feature adapter containing three adapter submodules of bottleneck architecture, which is simple but can efficiently integrate new knowledge of X-ray domain with original knowledge, further bridge domain gap and promote alignment between X-ray images and textual concepts. Extensive experiments conducted on PIXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that proposed method performs favorably against other baseline OVOD methods in detecting novel categories in X-ray scenario. It outperforms previous best result by 15.2 AP50 and 1.5 AP50 on PIXray and PIDray with achieving 21.0 AP50 and 27.8 AP50 respectively.</description>

      <title>ExPLoRA: Parameter-Efficient Extended Pre-Training to Adapt Vision Transformers under Domain Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can effectively adapt large pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks using only a small fraction (0.1%-10%) of the original trainable weights. An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this new domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain. In this extended pre-training phase, ExPLoRA only unfreezes 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and all normalization layers, and then tunes all other layers with LoRA. Finally, we fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 7% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using &lt;10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the art approaches. Our ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our approach over other baselines, including PEFT and simply unfreezing more transformer blocks.</description>

      <title>ViD-GPT: Introducing GPT-style Autoregressive Generation in Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. But generating temporal consistent long videos is still challenging. A majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate long videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on last frames of previous clip. However, existing approaches all involve bidirectional computations, which restricts the receptive context of each autoregression step, and results in the model lacking long-term dependencies. Inspired from the huge success of large language models (LLMs) and following GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), we bring causal (i.e., unidirectional) generation into VDMs, and use past frames as prompt to generate future frames. For Causal Generation, we introduce causal temporal attention into VDM, which forces each generated frame to depend on its previous frames. For Frame as Prompt, we inject the conditional frames by concatenating them with noisy frames (frames to be generated) along the temporal axis. Consequently, we present Video Diffusion GPT (ViD-GPT). Based on the two key designs, in each autoregression step, it is able to acquire long-term context from prompting frames concatenated by all previously generated frames. Additionally, we bring the kv-cache mechanism to VDMs, which eliminates the redundant computation from overlapped frames, significantly boosting the inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ViD-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on long video generation. Code will be available at https://github.com/Dawn-LX/Causal-VideoGen.</description>

      <title>Concept-skill Transferability-based Data Selection for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning, or supervised finetuning on extensive task-specific data, is necessary for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generalize well across a broad range of vision-language (VL) tasks. However, training on large VL datasets can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we introduce COINCIDE, an effective and scalable data selection technique that uses a small model as a reference model to select visual instruction tuning data for efficient finetuning of a target LVLM, focusing on diversity and transferability. Specifically, we cluster the training data using internal activations from a small model, which identifies VL concept-skill compositions needed by a target LVLM. We then sample data from these diverse clusters by considering their density and transferability, or the ability to transfer well to other concept-skill compositions. This approach ensures the diversity of these compositions, which is vital for LVLM generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COINCIDE achieves superior performance and data selection efficiency against 8 strong baselines on two distinct datasets: LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan. Using only 20% of the LLaVA-1.5 dataset, COINCIDE achieves performance comparable to the LVLM finetuned on the whole dataset, with 70% reduction of the wall-clock running time. On the Vision-Flan dataset, our method achieves superior results with only 16.7% of the training data.</description>

      <title>3D Gaze Tracking for Studying Collaborative Interactions in Mixed-Reality Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel framework for 3D gaze tracking tailored for mixed-reality settings, aimed at enhancing joint attention and collaborative efforts in team-based scenarios. Conventional gaze tracking, often limited by monocular cameras and traditional eye-tracking apparatus, struggles with simultaneous data synchronization and analysis from multiple participants in group contexts. Our proposed framework leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques to overcome these obstacles, enabling precise 3D gaze estimation without dependence on specialized hardware or complex data fusion. Utilizing facial recognition and deep learning, the framework achieves real-time, tracking of gaze patterns across several individuals, addressing common depth estimation errors, and ensuring spatial and identity consistency within the dataset. Empirical results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of our method in group environments. This provides mechanisms for significant advances in behavior and interaction analysis in educational and professional training applications in dynamic and unstructured environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the task of simultaneous monocular depth and visual odometry estimation, we propose learning self-supervised transformer-based models in two steps. Our first step consists in a generic pretraining to learn 3D geometry, using cross-view completion objective (CroCo), followed by self-supervised finetuning on non-annotated videos. We show that our self-supervised models can reach state-of-the-art performance 'without bells and whistles' using standard components such as visual transformers, dense prediction transformers and adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by running evaluations on six benchmark datasets, both static and dynamic, indoor and outdoor, with synthetic and real images. For all datasets, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, in particular for depth prediction task.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-SSC: Uncertainty-Aware Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of autonomous vehicle (AV) perception, comprehending 3D scenes is paramount for tasks such as planning and mapping. Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer scene geometry and semantics from limited observations. While camera-based SSC has gained popularity due to affordability and rich visual cues, existing methods often neglect the inherent uncertainty in models. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware camera-based 3D semantic scene completion method ($\alpha$-SSC). Our approach includes an uncertainty propagation framework from depth models (Depth-UP) to enhance geometry completion (up to 11.58% improvement) and semantic segmentation (up to 14.61% improvement). Additionally, we propose a hierarchical conformal prediction (HCP) method to quantify SSC uncertainty, effectively addressing high-level class imbalance in SSC datasets. On the geometry level, we present a novel KL divergence-based score function that significantly improves the occupied recall of safety-critical classes (45% improvement) with minimal performance overhead (3.4% reduction). For uncertainty quantification, we demonstrate the ability to achieve smaller prediction set sizes while maintaining a defined coverage guarantee. Compared with baselines, it achieves up to 85% reduction in set sizes. Our contributions collectively signify significant advancements in SSC accuracy and robustness, marking a noteworthy step forward in autonomous perception systems.</description>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits impressive capabilities in zero-shot segmentation for natural images. Recently, SAM has gained a great deal of attention for its applications in medical image segmentation. However, to our best knowledge, no studies have shown how to harness the power of SAM for medical image classification. To fill this gap and make SAM a true ``foundation model'' for medical image analysis, it is highly desirable to customize SAM specifically for medical image classification. In this paper, we introduce SAMAug-C, an innovative augmentation method based on SAM for augmenting classification datasets by generating variants of the original images. The augmented datasets can be used to train a deep learning classification model, thereby boosting the classification performance. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously processes raw and SAMAug-C augmented image input, capitalizing on the complementary information that is offered by both. Experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our new approach.</description>

      <title>Advancing Solar Flare Prediction using Deep Learning with Active Region Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for leveraging shape-based characteristics of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches and provide a novel capability for predicting solar flares covering the entirety of the solar disk (AR patches spanning from -90$^{\circ}$ to +90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude). We create three deep learning models: (i) ResNet34, (ii) MobileNet, and (iii) MobileViT to predict $\geq$M-class flares and assess the efficacy of these models across various ranges of solar longitude. Given the inherent imbalance in our data, we employ augmentation techniques alongside undersampling during the model training phase, while maintaining imbalanced partitions in the testing data for realistic evaluation. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, computed as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare models. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel capability in solar flare prediction that allows predicting flares for each ARs throughout the solar disk and evaluate and compare the performance, (ii) Our candidate model (MobileNet) achieves a CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.60 and HSS=0.44), CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.59 and HSS=0.44), and CSS=0.48 (TSS=0.56 and HSS=0.40) for AR patches within $\pm$30$^{\circ}$, $\pm$60$^{\circ}$, $\pm$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90 $^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.39 (TSS=0.48 and HSS=0.32), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advancement opens new avenues for more reliable prediction of solar flares, thereby contributing to improved forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>FastPoseCNN: Real-Time Monocular Category-Level Pose and Size Estimation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary focus of this paper is the development of a framework for pose and size estimation of unseen objects given a single RGB image - all in real-time. In 2019, the first category-level pose and size estimation framework was proposed alongside two novel datasets called CAMERA and REAL. However, current methodologies are restricted from practical use because of its long inference time (2-4 fps). Their approach's inference had significant delays because they used the computationally expensive MaskedRCNN framework and Umeyama algorithm. To optimize our method and yield real-time results, our framework uses the efficient ResNet-FPN framework alongside decoupling the translation, rotation, and size regression problem by using distinct decoders. Moreover, our methodology performs pose and size estimation in a global context - i.e., estimating the involved parameters of all captured objects in the image all at once. We perform extensive testing to fully compare the performance in terms of precision and speed to demonstrate the capability of our method.</description>

      <title>Parameter Blending for Multi-Camera Harmonization for Automotive Surround View Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a surround view system, the image color and tone captured by multiple cameras can be different due to cameras applying auto white balance (AWB), global tone mapping (GTM) individually for each camera. The color and brightness along stitched seam location may look discontinuous among multiple cameras which impacts overall stitched image visual quality. To improve the color transition between adjacent cameras in stitching algorithm, we propose harmonization algorithm which applies before stitching to adjust multiple cameras' color and tone so that stitched image has smoother color and tone transition between adjacent cameras. Our proposed harmonization algorithm consists of AWB harmonization and GTM harmonization leveraging Image Signal Processor (ISP)'s AWB and GTM metadata statistics. Experiment result shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms global color transfer method in both visual quality and computational cost.</description>

      <title>WildVision: Evaluating Vision-Language Models in the Wild with Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in vision-language models (VLMs) emphasize the necessity of benchmarking human preferences in real-world multimodal interactions. To address this gap, we launched WildVision-Arena (WV-Arena), an online platform that collects human preferences to evaluate VLMs. We curated WV-Bench by selecting 500 high-quality samples from 8,000 user submissions in WV-Arena. WV-Bench uses GPT-4 as the judge to compare each VLM with Claude-3-Sonnet, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the WV-Arena Elo. This significantly outperforms other benchmarks like MMVet, MMMU, and MMStar.
  Our comprehensive analysis of 20K real-world interactions reveals important insights into the failure cases of top-performing VLMs. For example, we find that although GPT-4V surpasses many other models like Reka-Flash, Opus, and Yi-VL-Plus in simple visual recognition and reasoning tasks, it still faces challenges with subtle contextual cues, spatial reasoning, visual imagination, and expert domain knowledge. Additionally, current VLMs exhibit issues with hallucinations and safety when intentionally provoked. We are releasing our chat and feedback data to further advance research in the field of VLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning Relighting and Intrinsic Decomposition in Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of extracting intrinsic components, such as reflectance and shading, from neural radiance fields is of growing interest. However, current methods largely focus on synthetic scenes and isolated objects, overlooking the complexities of real scenes with backgrounds. To address this gap, our research introduces a method that combines relighting with intrinsic decomposition. By leveraging light variations in scenes to generate pseudo labels, our method provides guidance for intrinsic decomposition without requiring ground truth data. Our method, grounded in physical constraints, ensures robustness across diverse scene types and reduces the reliance on pre-trained models or hand-crafted priors. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving convincing results. Furthermore, the applicability of our method to image editing tasks demonstrates promising outcomes.</description>

      <title>GANmut: Generating and Modifying Facial Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of emotion synthesis, the ability to create authentic and nuanced facial expressions continues to gain importance. The GANmut study discusses a recently introduced advanced GAN framework that, instead of relying on predefined labels, learns a dynamic and interpretable emotion space. This methodology maps each discrete emotion as vectors starting from a neutral state, their magnitude reflecting the emotion's intensity. The current project aims to extend the study of this framework by benchmarking across various datasets, image resolutions, and facial detection methodologies. This will involve conducting a series of experiments using two emotional datasets: Aff-Wild2 and AffNet. Aff-Wild2 contains videos captured in uncontrolled environments, which include diverse camera angles, head positions, and lighting conditions, providing a real-world challenge. AffNet offers images with labelled emotions, improving the diversity of emotional expressions available for training. The first two experiments will focus on training GANmut using the Aff-Wild2 dataset, processed with either RetinaFace or MTCNN, both of which are high-performance deep learning face detectors. This setup will help determine how well GANmut can learn to synthesise emotions under challenging conditions and assess the comparative effectiveness of these face detection technologies. The subsequent two experiments will merge the Aff-Wild2 and AffNet datasets, combining the real world variability of Aff-Wild2 with the diverse emotional labels of AffNet. The same face detectors, RetinaFace and MTCNN, will be employed to evaluate whether the enhanced diversity of the combined datasets improves GANmut's performance and to compare the impact of each face detection method in this hybrid setup.</description>

      <title>An Analysis on Quantizing Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) utilize an iterative denoising process to transform random noise into synthetic data. Initally proposed with a UNet structure, DMs excel at producing images that are virtually indistinguishable with or without conditioned text prompts. Later transformer-only structure is composed with DMs to achieve better performance. Though Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) reduce the computational requirement by denoising in a latent space, it is extremely expensive to inference images for any operating devices due to the shear volume of parameters and feature sizes. Post Training Quantization (PTQ) offers an immediate remedy for a smaller storage size and more memory-efficient computation during inferencing. Prior works address PTQ of DMs on UNet structures have addressed the challenges in calibrating parameters for both activations and weights via moderate optimization. In this work, we pioneer an efficient PTQ on transformer-only structure without any optimization. By analysing challenges in quantizing activations and weights for diffusion transformers, we propose a single-step sampling calibration on activations and adapt group-wise quantization on weights for low-bit quantization. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed methods with preliminary experiments on conditional image generation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models, especially in areas where security is critical. However, traditional OOD detection methods often fail to capture complex data distributions from large scale date. In this paper, we present a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages the generative ability of diffusion models and the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CLIP. By using these features as conditional inputs to a diffusion model, we can reconstruct the images after encoding them with CLIP. The difference between the original and reconstructed images is used as a signal for OOD identification. The practicality and scalability of our method is increased by the fact that it does not require class-specific labeled ID data, as is the case with many other methods. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of our method, which have significantly improved the detection accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a well-behaved neural network, is possible to identify its parent, based on which it was tuned? In this paper, we introduce a novel task known as neural lineage detection, aiming at discovering lineage relationships between parent and child models. Specifically, from a set of parent models, neural lineage detection predicts which parent model a child model has been fine-tuned from. We propose two approaches to address this task. (1) For practical convenience, we introduce a learning-free approach, which integrates an approximation of the finetuning process into the neural network representation similarity metrics, leading to a similarity-based lineage detection scheme. (2) For the pursuit of accuracy, we introduce a learning-based lineage detector comprising encoders and a transformer detector. Through experimentation, we have validated that our proposed learning-free and learning-based methods outperform the baseline in various learning settings and are adaptable to a variety of visual models. Moreover, they also exhibit the ability to trace cross-generational lineage, identifying not only parent models but also their ancestors.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models in Low-Level Vision: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have garnered significant attention in low-level vision tasks due to their generative capabilities. Among them, diffusion model-based solutions, characterized by a forward diffusion process and a reverse denoising process, have emerged as widely acclaimed for their ability to produce samples of superior quality and diversity. This ensures the generation of visually compelling results with intricate texture information. Despite their remarkable success, a noticeable gap exists in a comprehensive survey that amalgamates these pioneering diffusion model-based works and organizes the corresponding threads. This paper proposes the comprehensive review of diffusion model-based techniques. We present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks and explore their correlations with other deep generative models, establishing the theoretical foundation. Following this, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models, considering both the underlying framework and the target task. Additionally, we summarize extended diffusion models applied in other tasks, including medical, remote sensing, and video scenarios. Moreover, we provide an overview of commonly used benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We conduct a thorough evaluation, encompassing both performance and efficiency, of diffusion model-based techniques in three prominent tasks. Finally, we elucidate the limitations of current diffusion models and propose seven intriguing directions for future research. This comprehensive examination aims to facilitate a profound understanding of the landscape surrounding denoising diffusion models in the context of low-level vision tasks. A curated list of diffusion model-based techniques in over 20 low-level vision tasks can be found at https://github.com/ChunmingHe/awesome-diffusion-models-in-low-level-vision.</description>

      <title>Federated Face Forgery Detection Learning with Personalized Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generator technology can produce high-quality fake videos that are indistinguishable, posing a serious social threat. Traditional forgery detection methods directly centralized training on data and lacked consideration of information sharing in non-public video data scenarios and data privacy. Naturally, the federated learning strategy can be applied for privacy protection, which aggregates model parameters of clients but not original data. However, simple federated learning can't achieve satisfactory performance because of poor generalization capabilities for the real hybrid-domain forgery dataset. To solve the problem, the paper proposes a novel federated face forgery detection learning with personalized representation. The designed Personalized Forgery Representation Learning aims to learn the personalized representation of each client to improve the detection performance of individual client models. In addition, a personalized federated learning training strategy is utilized to update the parameters of the distributed detection model. Here collaborative training is conducted on multiple distributed client devices, and shared representations of these client models are uploaded to the server side for aggregation. Experiments on several public face forgery detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at \emph{https://github.com/GANG370/PFR-Forgery.}</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Recognition via Stage-Wise Augmented Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot recognition aims to train a classification model with only a few labeled examples of pre-defined concepts, where annotation can be costly in a downstream task. In another related research area, zero-shot recognition, which assumes no access to any downstream-task data, has been greatly advanced by using pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this area, retrieval-augmented learning (RAL) effectively boosts zero-shot accuracy by retrieving and learning from external data relevant to downstream concepts. Motivated by these advancements, our work explores RAL for few-shot recognition. While seemingly straightforward despite being under-explored in the literature (till now!), we present novel challenges and opportunities for applying RAL for few-shot recognition. First, perhaps surprisingly, simply finetuning the VLM on a large amount of retrieved data barely surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot methods due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps compared to few-shot annotated data. Second, finetuning a VLM on few-shot examples alone significantly outperforms prior methods, and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third, to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issue, we propose Stage-Wise Augmented fineTuning (SWAT) method, which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data for the first stage and retraining the classifier solely on the few-shot data in the second stage. Extensive experiments show that SWAT achieves the best performance on standard benchmark datasets, resoundingly outperforming prior works by ~10% in accuracy.

      <title>SUGARCREPE++ Dataset: Vision-Language Model Sensitivity to Semantic and Lexical Alterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable successes, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including vision-and-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs), fail to understand precise semantics. For example, semantically equivalent sentences expressed using different lexical compositions elicit diverging representations. The degree of this divergence and its impact on encoded semantics is not very well understood. In this paper, we introduce the SUGARCREPE++ dataset to analyze the sensitivity of VLMs and ULMs to lexical and semantic alterations. Each sample in SUGARCREPE++ dataset consists of an image and a corresponding triplet of captions: a pair of semantically equivalent but lexically different positive captions and one hard negative caption. This poses a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence problem to the language models. We comprehensively evaluate VLMs and ULMs that differ in architecture, pre-training objectives and datasets to benchmark the performance of SUGARCREPE++ dataset. Experimental results highlight the difficulties of VLMs in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations, particularly in object attributes and spatial relations. Although VLMs with larger pre-training datasets, model sizes, and multiple pre-training objectives achieve better performance on SUGARCREPE++, there is a significant opportunity for improvement. We show that all the models which achieve better performance on compositionality datasets need not perform equally well on SUGARCREPE++, signifying that compositionality alone may not be sufficient for understanding semantic and lexical alterations. Given the importance of the property that the SUGARCREPE++ dataset targets, it serves as a new challenge to the vision-and-language community.</description>

      <title>Frozen CLIP: A Strong Backbone for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has witnessed great achievements with image-level labels. Several recent approaches use the CLIP model to generate pseudo labels for training an individual segmentation model, while there is no attempt to apply the CLIP model as the backbone to directly segment objects with image-level labels. In this paper, we propose WeCLIP, a CLIP-based single-stage pipeline, for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, the frozen CLIP model is applied as the backbone for semantic feature extraction, and a new decoder is designed to interpret extracted semantic features for final prediction. Meanwhile, we utilize the above frozen backbone to generate pseudo labels for training the decoder. Such labels cannot be optimized during training. We then propose a refinement module (RFM) to rectify them dynamically. Our architecture enforces the proposed decoder and RFM to benefit from each other to boost the final performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms other approaches with less training cost. Additionally, our WeCLIP also obtains promising results for fully supervised settings. The code is available at https://github.com/zbf1991/WeCLIP.</description>

      <title>Vid3D: Synthesis of Dynamic 3D Scenes using 2D Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent frontier in computer vision has been the task of 3D video generation, which consists of generating a time-varying 3D representation of a scene. To generate dynamic 3D scenes, current methods explicitly model 3D temporal dynamics by jointly optimizing for consistency across both time and views of the scene. In this paper, we instead investigate whether it is necessary to explicitly enforce multiview consistency over time, as current approaches do, or if it is sufficient for a model to generate 3D representations of each timestep independently. We hence propose a model, Vid3D, that leverages 2D video diffusion to generate 3D videos by first generating a 2D "seed" of the video's temporal dynamics and then independently generating a 3D representation for each timestep in the seed video. We evaluate Vid3D against two state-of-the-art 3D video generation methods and find that Vid3D is achieves comparable results despite not explicitly modeling 3D temporal dynamics. We further ablate how the quality of Vid3D depends on the number of views generated per frame. While we observe some degradation with fewer views, performance degradation remains minor. Our results thus suggest that 3D temporal knowledge may not be necessary to generate high-quality dynamic 3D scenes, potentially enabling simpler generative algorithms for this task.</description>

      <title>Consistency^2: Consistent and Fast 3D Painting with Latent Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative 3D Painting is among the top productivity boosters in high-resolution 3D asset management and recycling. Ever since text-to-image models became accessible for inference on consumer hardware, the performance of 3D Painting methods has consistently improved and is currently close to plateauing. At the core of most such models lies denoising diffusion in the latent space, an inherently time-consuming iterative process. Multiple techniques have been developed recently to accelerate generation and reduce sampling iterations by orders of magnitude. Designed for 2D generative imaging, these techniques do not come with recipes for lifting them into 3D. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by proposing a Latent Consistency Model (LCM) adaptation for the task at hand. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model and evaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on the Objaverse dataset samples study, our 3D painting method attains strong preference in all evaluations.

      <title>Zero-Shot Scene Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, training-free approach to scene change detection. Our method leverages tracking models, which inherently perform change detection between consecutive frames of video by identifying common objects and detecting new or missing objects. Specifically, our method takes advantage of the change detection effect of the tracking model by inputting reference and query images instead of consecutive frames. Furthermore, we focus on the content gap and style gap between two input images in change detection, and address both issues by proposing adaptive content threshold and style bridging layers, respectively. Finally, we extend our approach to video to exploit rich temporal information, enhancing scene change detection performance. We compare our approach and baseline through various experiments. While existing train-based baseline tend to specialize only in the trained domain, our method shows consistent performance across various domains, proving the competitiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Pixel Retrieval with Spatial and Uncertainty Aware Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of both image retrieval and pixel retrieval. Traditional diffusion methods struggle to propagate spatial information effectively in conventional graphs due to their reliance on scalar edge weights. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, uniquely capable of efficiently propagating spatial information using local features during query time, thereby accurately retrieving and localizing objects within a database.
  Additionally, we innovatively utilize the structural information of the image graph through a technique we term "community selection". This approach allows for the assessment of the initial search result's uncertainty and facilitates an optimal balance between accuracy and speed. This is particularly crucial in real-world applications where such trade-offs are often necessary.
  Our experimental results, conducted on the (P)ROxford and (P)RParis datasets, demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over existing diffusion techniques. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in both image-level and pixel-level retrieval, while also maintaining impressive processing speed. This dual achievement underscores the effectiveness of our hypergraph-based framework and community selection technique, marking a notable advancement in the field of content-based image retrieval.</description>

      <title>STEVE Series: Step-by-Step Construction of Agent Systems in Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building an embodied agent system with a large language model (LLM) as its core is a promising direction. Due to the significant costs and uncontrollable factors associated with deploying and training such agents in the real world, we have decided to begin our exploration within the Minecraft environment. Our STEVE Series agents can complete basic tasks in a virtual environment and more challenging tasks such as navigation and even creative tasks, with an efficiency far exceeding previous state-of-the-art methods by a factor of $2.5\times$ to $7.3\times$. We begin our exploration with a vanilla large language model, augmenting it with a vision encoder and an action codebase trained on our collected high-quality dataset STEVE-21K. Subsequently, we enhanced it with a Critic and memory to transform it into a complex system. Finally, we constructed a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our recent work explored how to prune the agent system through knowledge distillation. In the future, we will explore more potential applications of STEVE agents in the real world.</description>

      <title>Mining Open Semantics from CLIP: A Relation Transition Perspective for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training(CLIP) demonstrates impressive zero-shot capability. The key to improve the adaptation of CLIP to downstream task with few exemplars lies in how to effectively model and transfer the useful knowledge embedded in CLIP. Previous work mines the knowledge typically based on the limited visual samples and close-set semantics (i.e., within target category set of downstream task). However, the aligned CLIP image/text encoders contain abundant relationships between visual features and almost infinite open semantics, which may benefit the few-shot learning but remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose to mine open semantics as anchors to perform a relation transition from image-anchor relationship to image-target relationship to make predictions. Specifically, we adopt a transformer module which takes the visual feature as "Query", the text features of the anchors as "Key" and the similarity matrix between the text features of anchor and target classes as "Value". In this way, the output of such a transformer module represents the relationship between the image and target categories, i.e., the classification predictions. To avoid manually selecting the open semantics, we make the [CLASS] token of input text embedding learnable. We conduct extensive experiments on eleven representative classification datasets. The results show that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts considering few-shot classification settings.</description>

      <title>Holistic-Motion2D: Scalable Whole-body Human Motion Generation in 2D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel path to $\textit{general}$ human motion generation by focusing on 2D space. Traditional methods have primarily generated human motions in 3D, which, while detailed and realistic, are often limited by the scope of available 3D motion data in terms of both the size and the diversity. To address these limitations, we exploit extensive availability of 2D motion data. We present $\textbf{Holistic-Motion2D}$, the first comprehensive and large-scale benchmark for 2D whole-body motion generation, which includes over 1M in-the-wild motion sequences, each paired with high-quality whole-body/partial pose annotations and textual descriptions. Notably, Holistic-Motion2D is ten times larger than the previously largest 3D motion dataset. We also introduce a baseline method, featuring innovative $\textit{whole-body part-aware attention}$ and $\textit{confidence-aware modeling}$ techniques, tailored for 2D $\underline{\text T}$ext-driv$\underline{\text{EN}}$ whole-bo$\underline{\text D}$y motion gen$\underline{\text{ER}}$ation, namely $\textbf{Tender}$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textbf{Holistic-Motion2D}$ and $\textbf{Tender}$ in generating expressive, diverse, and realistic human motions. We also highlight the utility of 2D motion for various downstream applications and its potential for lifting to 3D motion. The page link is: https://holistic-motion2d.github.io.</description>

      <title>YOLO9tr: A Lightweight Model for Pavement Damage Detection Utilizing a Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network and Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining road pavement integrity is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient transportation. Conventional methods for assessing pavement condition are often laborious and susceptible to human error. This paper proposes YOLO9tr, a novel lightweight object detection model for pavement damage detection, leveraging the advancements of deep learning. YOLO9tr is based on the YOLOv9 architecture, incorporating a partial attention block that enhances feature extraction and attention mechanisms, leading to improved detection performance in complex scenarios. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising road damage images from multiple countries, including an expanded set of damage categories beyond the standard four. This broadened classification range allows for a more accurate and realistic assessment of pavement conditions. Comparative analysis demonstrates YOLO9tr's superior precision and inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models like YOLO8, YOLO9 and YOLO10, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy. The model achieves a high frame rate of up to 136 FPS, making it suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance and automated inspection systems. The research presents an ablation study to analyze the impact of architectural modifications and hyperparameter variations on model performance, further validating the effectiveness of the partial attention block. The results highlight YOLO9tr's potential for practical deployment in real-time pavement condition monitoring, contributing to the development of robust and efficient solutions for maintaining safe and functional road infrastructure.</description>

      <title>NLDF: Neural Light Dynamic Fields for Efficient 3D Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking head generation based on the neural radiation fields model has shown promising visual effects. However, the slow rendering speed of NeRF seriously limits its application, due to the burdensome calculation process over hundreds of sampled points to synthesize one pixel. In this work, a novel Neural Light Dynamic Fields model is proposed aiming to achieve generating high quality 3D talking face with significant speedup. The NLDF represents light fields based on light segments, and a deep network is used to learn the entire light beam's information at once. In learning the knowledge distillation is applied and the NeRF based synthesized result is used to guide the correct coloration of light segments in NLDF. Furthermore, a novel active pool training strategy is proposed to focus on high frequency movements, particularly on the speaker mouth and eyebrows. The propose method effectively represents the facial light dynamics in 3D talking video generation, and it achieves approximately 30 times faster speed compared to state of the art NeRF based method, with comparable generation visual quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use machine-generated instruction-following data to improve the zero-shot capabilities of a large multimodal model with additional support for generative and image editing tasks. We achieve this by curating a new multimodal instruction-following set using GPT-4V and existing datasets for image generation and editing. Using this instruction set and the existing LLaVA-Finetune instruction set for visual understanding tasks, we produce GenLLaVA, a Generative Large Language, and Visual Assistant. GenLLaVA is built through a strategy that combines three types of large pre-trained models through instruction finetuning: LLaMA for language modeling, SigLIP for image-text matching, and StableDiffusion for text-to-image generation. Our model demonstrates visual understanding capabilities on par with LLaVA and additionally demonstrates competitive results with native multimodal models such as Unified-IO 2, paving the way for building advanced general-purpose visual assistants by effectively re-using existing multimodal models. We open-source our dataset, codebase, and model checkpoints to foster further research and application in this domain.</description>

      <title>DRIP: Discriminative Rotation-Invariant Pole Landmark Descriptor for 3D LiDAR Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 3D LiDAR-based robot self-localization, pole-like landmarks are gaining popularity as lightweight and discriminative landmarks. This work introduces a novel approach called "discriminative rotation-invariant poles," which enhances the discriminability of pole-like landmarks while maintaining their lightweight nature. Unlike conventional methods that model a pole landmark as a 3D line segment perpendicular to the ground, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that includes not only the line segment's main body but also its surrounding local region of interest (ROI) as part of the pole landmark. Specifically, we describe the appearance, geometry, and semantic features within this ROI to improve the discriminability of the pole landmark. Since such pole landmarks are no longer rotation-invariant, we introduce a novel rotation-invariant convolutional neural network that automatically and efficiently extracts rotation-invariant features from input point clouds for recognition. Furthermore, we train a pole dictionary through unsupervised learning and use it to compress poles into compact pole words, thereby significantly reducing real-time costs while maintaining optimal self-localization performance. Monte Carlo localization experiments using publicly available NCLT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves a state-of-the-art pole-based localization framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and three billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS. Our data and code will be released at https://github.com/mlfoundations/MINT-1T.</description>

      <title>i-SRT: Aligning Large Multimodal Models for Videos by Iterative Self-Retrospective Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) face challenges such as modality misalignment and verbose responses. Although iterative approaches such as self-rewarding or iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) recently showed a significant improvement in language model alignment, particularly on reasoning tasks, self-aligned models applied to large video-language models often result in lengthy and irrelevant responses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that employs self-retrospection to enhance both response generation and preference modeling, and call iterative self-retrospective judgment (i-SRT). By revisiting and evaluating already generated content and preference in loop, i-SRT improves the alignment between textual and visual modalities, reduce verbosity, and enhances content relevance. Our empirical evaluations across diverse video question answering benchmarks demonstrate that i-SRT significantly outperforms prior arts. We are committed to opensourcing our code, models, and datasets to encourage further investigation.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Progress: Generating Road Network from Satellite Imagery for Socioeconomic Insights in Impoverished Areas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to resolve societal challenges, such as eradicating poverty and improving the lives of vulnerable populations in impoverished areas. Those areas rely on road infrastructure construction to promote accessibility and economic development. Although publicly available data like OpenStreetMap is available to monitor road status, data completeness in impoverished areas is limited. Meanwhile, the development of deep learning techniques and satellite imagery shows excellent potential for earth monitoring. To tackle the challenge of road network assessment in impoverished areas, we develop a systematic road extraction framework combining an encoder-decoder architecture and morphological operations on satellite imagery, offering an integrated workflow for interdisciplinary researchers. Extensive experiments of road network extraction on real-world data in impoverished regions achieve a 42.7% enhancement in the F1-score over the baseline methods and reconstruct about 80% of the actual roads. We also propose a comprehensive road network dataset covering approximately 794,178 km2 area and 17.048 million people in 382 impoverished counties in China. The generated dataset is further utilized to conduct socioeconomic analysis in impoverished counties, showing that road network construction positively impacts regional economic development. The technical appendix, code, and generated dataset can be found at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Road_network_extraction_impoverished_counties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalizability of Representation Learning for Data-Efficient 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of self-supervised 3D representation learning has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the challenge presented by the scarcity of extensive, well-annotated datasets. However, it continues to be hindered by the lack of diverse, large-scale, real-world 3D scene datasets for source data. To address this shortfall, we propose Generalizable Representation Learning (GRL), where we devise a generative Bayesian network to produce diverse synthetic scenes with real-world patterns, and conduct pre-training with a joint objective. By jointly learning a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning task and an occlusion-aware reconstruction task, the model is primed with transferable, geometry-informed representations. Post pre-training on synthetic data, the acquired knowledge of the model can be seamlessly transferred to two principal downstream tasks associated with 3D scene understanding, namely 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation, using real-world benchmark datasets. A thorough series of experiments robustly display our method's consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art pre-training approaches.</description>

      <title>VideoVista: A Versatile Benchmark for Video Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant breakthroughs in video analysis driven by the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), there remains a lack of a versatile evaluation benchmark to comprehensively assess these models' performance in video understanding and reasoning. To address this, we present VideoVista, a video QA benchmark that integrates challenges across diverse content categories, durations, and abilities. Specifically, VideoVista comprises 25,000 questions derived from 3,400 videos spanning 14 categories (e.g., Howto, Film, and Entertainment) with durations ranging from a few seconds to over 10 minutes. Besides, it encompasses 19 types of understanding tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, interaction understanding) and 8 reasoning tasks (e.g., logical reasoning, causal reasoning). To achieve this, we present an automatic data construction framework, leveraging powerful GPT-4o alongside advanced analysis tools (e.g., video splitting, object segmenting, and tracking). We also utilize this framework to construct training data to enhance the capabilities of video-related LMMs (Video-LMMs). Through a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of cutting-edge models, we reveal that: 1) Video-LMMs face difficulties in fine-grained video tasks involving temporal location, object tracking, and anomaly detection; 2) Video-LMMs present inferior logical and relation reasoning abilities; 3) Open-source Video-LMMs' performance is significantly lower than GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5, lagging by 20 points. This highlights the crucial role VideoVista will play in advancing LMMs that can accurately understand videos and perform precise reasoning.</description>

      <title>BaFTA: Backprop-Free Test-Time Adaptation For Zero-Shot Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11309v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot image classification capabilities across diverse domains. To enhance CLIP's performance while preserving the zero-shot paradigm, various test-time prompt tuning methods have been introduced to refine class embeddings through unsupervised learning objectives during inference. However, these methods often encounter challenges in selecting appropriate learning rates to prevent collapsed training in the absence of validation data during test-time adaptation. In this study, we propose a novel backpropagation-free algorithm BaFTA for test-time adaptation of vision-language models. Instead of fine-tuning text prompts to refine class embeddings, our approach directly estimates class centroids using online clustering within a projected embedding space that aligns text and visual embeddings. We dynamically aggregate predictions from both estimated and original class embeddings, as well as from distinct augmented views, by assessing the reliability of each prediction using R\'enyi Entropy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BaFTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Federated Active Learning Framework for Efficient Annotation Strategy in Skin-lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple institutes to train models collaboratively without sharing private data. Current FL research focuses on communication efficiency, privacy protection, and personalization and assumes that the data of FL have already been ideally collected. In medical scenarios, however, data annotation demands both expertise and intensive labor, which is a critical problem in FL. Active learning (AL), has shown promising performance in reducing the number of data annotations in medical image analysis. We propose a federated AL (FedAL) framework in which AL is executed periodically and interactively under FL. We exploit a local model in each hospital and a global model acquired from FL to construct an ensemble. We use ensemble-entropy-based AL as an efficient data-annotation strategy in FL. Therefore, our FedAL framework can decrease the amount of annotated data and preserve patient privacy while maintaining the performance of FL. To our knowledge, this is the first FedAL framework applied to medical images. We validated our framework on real-world dermoscopic datasets. Using only 50% of samples, our framework was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a skin-lesion classification task. Our framework performed better than several state-of-the-art AL methods under FL and achieved comparable performance to full-data FL.</description>

      <title>Syn-to-Real Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Indoor 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of synthetic data in indoor 3D object detection offers the potential of greatly reducing the manual labor involved in 3D annotations and training effective zero-shot detectors. However, the complicated domain shifts across syn-to-real indoor datasets remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Object-wise Hierarchical Domain Alignment (OHDA) framework for syn-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation in indoor 3D object detection. Our approach includes an object-aware augmentation strategy to effectively diversify the source domain data, and we introduce a two-branch adaptation framework consisting of an adversarial training branch and a pseudo labeling branch, in order to simultaneously reach holistic-level and class-level domain alignment. The pseudo labeling is further refined through two proposed schemes specifically designed for indoor UDA. Our adaptation results from synthetic dataset 3D-FRONT to real-world datasets ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate remarkable mAP25 improvements of 9.7% and 9.1% over Source-Only baselines, respectively, and consistently outperform the methods adapted from 2D and 3D outdoor scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation Using Target-Oriented Domain Augmentation for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, in real-world environments, variations in sensor data distribution due to sensor upgrades, weather changes, and geographic differences can adversely affect detection performance. Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) aims to mitigate these challenges by transferring knowledge from a source domain, abundant in labeled data, to a target domain where labels are scarce. This paper presents a new SSDA method referred to as Target-Oriented Domain Augmentation (TODA) specifically tailored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. TODA efficiently utilizes all available data, including labeled data in the source domain, and both labeled data and unlabeled data in the target domain to enhance domain adaptation performance. TODA consists of two stages: TargetMix and AdvMix. TargetMix employs mixing augmentation accounting for LiDAR sensor characteristics to facilitate feature alignment between the source-domain and target-domain. AdvMix applies point-wise adversarial augmentation with mixing augmentation, which perturbs the unlabeled data to align the features within both labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain. Our experiments conducted on the challenging domain adaptation tasks demonstrate that TODA outperforms existing domain adaptation techniques designed for 3D object detection by significant margins. The code is available at: https://github.com/rasd3/TODA.</description>

      <title>Temporal Lidar Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the lidar measurements from an autonomous vehicle, we can project the points and generate a sparse depth image. Depth completion aims at increasing the resolution of such a depth image by infilling and interpolating the sparse depth values. Like most existing approaches, we make use of camera images as guidance in very sparse or occluded regions. In addition, we propose a temporal algorithm that utilizes information from previous timesteps using recurrence. In this work, we show how a state-of-the-art method PENet can be modified to benefit from recurrency. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI depth completion dataset while adding only less than one percent of additional overhead in terms of both neural network parameters and floating point operations. The accuracy is especially improved for faraway objects and regions containing a low amount of lidar depth samples. Even in regions without any ground truth (like sky and rooftops) we observe large improvements which are not captured by the existing evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Low-power Ship Detection in Satellite Images Using Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitting Earth observation image data from satellites to ground stations incurs significant costs in terms of power and bandwidth. For maritime ship detection, on-board data processing can identify ships and reduce the amount of data sent to the ground. However, most images captured on board contain only bodies of water or land, with the Airbus Ship Detection dataset showing only 22.1\% of images containing ships. We designed a low-power, two-stage system to optimize performance instead of relying on a single complex model. The first stage is a lightweight binary classifier that acts as a gating mechanism to detect the presence of ships. This stage runs on Brainchip's Akida 1.0, which leverages activation sparsity to minimize dynamic power consumption. The second stage employs a YOLOv5 object detection model to identify the location and size of ships. This approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 76.9\%, which increases to 79.3\% when evaluated solely on images containing ships, by reducing false positives. Additionally, we calculated that evaluating the full validation set on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano device requires 111.4 kJ of energy. Our two-stage system reduces this energy consumption to 27.3 kJ, which is less than a fourth, demonstrating the efficiency of a heterogeneous computing system.</description>

      <title>ClawMachine: Fetching Visual Tokens as An Entity for Referring and Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential topic for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is aligning vision and language concepts at a finer level. In particular, we devote efforts to encoding visual referential information for tasks such as referring and grounding. Existing methods, including proxy encoding and geometry encoding, incorporate additional syntax to encode the object's location, bringing extra burdens in training MLLMs to communicate between language and vision. This study presents ClawMachine, offering a new methodology that notates an entity directly using the visual tokens. It allows us to unify the prompt and answer of visual referential tasks without additional syntax. Upon a joint vision-language vocabulary, ClawMachine unifies visual referring and grounding into an auto-regressive format and learns with a decoder-only architecture. Experiments validate that our model achieves competitive performance across visual referring and grounding tasks with a reduced demand for training data. Additionally, ClawMachine demonstrates a native ability to integrate multi-source information for complex visual reasoning, which prior MLLMs can hardly perform without specific adaptions.</description>

      <title>They're All Doctors: Synthesizing Diverse Counterfactuals to Mitigate Associative Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are powerful models; however they can exhibit unwanted biases, making them less safe when deployed directly in applications such as text-to-image, text-to-video retrievals, reverse search, or classification tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic counterfactual images to create a diverse and balanced dataset that can be used to fine-tune CLIP. Given a set of diverse synthetic base images from text-to-image models, we leverage off-the-shelf segmentation and inpainting models to place humans with diverse visual appearances in context. We show that CLIP trained on such datasets learns to disentangle the human appearance from the context of an image, i.e., what makes a doctor is not correlated to the person's visual appearance, like skin color or body type, but to the context, such as background, the attire they are wearing, or the objects they are holding. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned CLIP model, $CF_\alpha$, improves key fairness metrics such as MaxSkew, MinSkew, and NDKL by 40-66\% for image retrieval tasks, while still achieving similar levels of performance in downstream tasks. We show that, by design, our model retains maximal compatibility with the original CLIP models, and can be easily controlled to support different accuracy versus fairness trade-offs in a plug-n-play fashion.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Mitigation Prompts Long-term Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models have made significant advancements in video understanding tasks. However, their ability to understand unprocessed long videos is very limited, primarily due to the difficulty in supporting the enormous memory overhead. Although existing methods achieve a balance between memory and information by aggregating frames, they inevitably introduce the severe hallucination issue. To address this issue, this paper constructs a comprehensive hallucination mitigation pipeline based on existing MLLMs. Specifically, we use the CLIP Score to guide the frame sampling process with questions, selecting key frames relevant to the question. Then, We inject question information into the queries of the image Q-former to obtain more important visual features. Finally, during the answer generation stage, we utilize chain-of-thought and in-context learning techniques to explicitly control the generation of answers. It is worth mentioning that for the breakpoint mode, we found that image understanding models achieved better results than video understanding models. Therefore, we aggregated the answers from both types of models using a comparison mechanism. Ultimately, We achieved 84.2\% and 62.9\% for the global and breakpoint modes respectively on the MovieChat dataset, surpassing the official baseline model by 29.1\% and 24.1\%. Moreover the proposed method won the third place in the CVPR LOVEU 2024 Long-Term Video Question Answering Challenge.

      <title>CM2-Net: Continual Cross-Modal Mapping Network for Driver Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11340v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver action recognition has significantly advanced in enhancing driver-vehicle interactions and ensuring driving safety by integrating multiple modalities, such as infrared and depth. Nevertheless, compared to RGB modality only, it is always laborious and costly to collect extensive data for all types of non-RGB modalities in car cabin environments. Therefore, previous works have suggested independently learning each non-RGB modality by fine-tuning a model pre-trained on RGB videos, but these methods are less effective in extracting informative features when faced with newly-incoming modalities due to large domain gaps. In contrast, we propose a Continual Cross-Modal Mapping Network (CM2-Net) to continually learn each newly-incoming modality with instructive prompts from the previously-learned modalities. Specifically, we have developed Accumulative Cross-modal Mapping Prompting (ACMP), to map the discriminative and informative features learned from previous modalities into the feature space of newly-incoming modalities. Then, when faced with newly-incoming modalities, these mapped features are able to provide effective prompts for which features should be extracted and prioritized. These prompts are accumulating throughout the continual learning process, thereby boosting further recognition performances. Extensive experiments conducted on the Drive&amp;Act dataset demonstrate the performance superiority of CM2-Net on both uni- and multi-modal driver action recognition.</description>

      <title>Video Frame Interpolation for Polarization via Swin-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has been extensively explored and demonstrated, yet its application to polarization remains largely unexplored. Due to the selective transmission of light by polarized filters, longer exposure times are typically required to ensure sufficient light intensity, which consequently lower the temporal sample rates. Furthermore, because polarization reflected by objects varies with shooting perspective, focusing solely on estimating pixel displacement is insufficient to accurately reconstruct the intermediate polarization. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a multi-stage and multi-scale network called Swin-VFI based on the Swin-Transformer and introduces a tailored loss function to facilitate the network's understanding of polarization changes. To ensure the practicality of our proposed method, this study evaluates its interpolated frames in Shape from Polarization (SfP) and Human Shape Reconstruction tasks, comparing them with other state-of-the-art methods such as CAIN, FLAVR, and VFIT. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's superior reconstruction accuracy across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Multi-Granularity for Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging research area focused on segmenting fine-grained entities based on diverse and previously unseen vocabularies. Our study highlights the inherent complexities of part segmentation due to intricate boundaries and diverse granularity, reflecting the knowledge-based nature of part identification. To address these challenges, we propose PartCLIPSeg, a novel framework utilizing generalized parts and object-level contexts to mitigate the lack of generalization in fine-grained parts. PartCLIPSeg integrates competitive part relationships and attention control techniques, alleviating ambiguous boundaries and underrepresented parts. Experimental results demonstrate that PartCLIPSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art OVPS methods, offering refined segmentation and an advanced understanding of part relationships in images. Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrated an improvement over the state-of-the-art models on the Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Structured Generation: CVPR's 2nd MMFM Challenge Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Foundation Models (MMFMs) have shown remarkable performance on various computer vision and natural language processing tasks. However, their performance on particular tasks such as document understanding is still limited. They also require more compute, time, and engineering resources to finetune and deploy compared to traditional, unimodal models. In this report, we present Multimodal Structured Generation, a general framework which constrains the output logits of frozen MMFMs to force them to reason before responding with structured outputs that downstream APIs can parse and use. We provide a detailed account of our approach, including the technical details, theoretical discussions, and final evaluation results in the 2nd Multimodal Foundation Models Challenge hosted by the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference. Our approach achieved the second highest score in the hidden test set for Phase 2 and third highest overall. This shows the method's ability to generalize to unseen tasks. And that simple engineering can beat expensive &amp; complicated modelling steps as we first discussed in our paper, Retrieval Augmented Structured Generation: Business Document Information Extraction as Tool Use.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AnyTrans, an all-encompassing framework for the task-Translate AnyText in the Image (TATI), which includes multilingual text translation and text fusion within images. Our framework leverages the strengths of large-scale models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and text-guided diffusion models, to incorporate contextual cues from both textual and visual elements during translation. The few-shot learning capability of LLMs allows for the translation of fragmented texts by considering the overall context. Meanwhile, the advanced inpainting and editing abilities of diffusion models make it possible to fuse translated text seamlessly into the original image while preserving its style and realism. Additionally, our framework can be constructed entirely using open-source models and requires no training, making it highly accessible and easily expandable. To encourage advancement in the TATI task, we have meticulously compiled a test dataset called MTIT6, which consists of multilingual text image translation data from six language pairs.</description>

      <title>SWCF-Net: Similarity-weighted Convolution and Local-global Fusion for Efficient Large-scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale point cloud consists of a multitude of individual objects, thereby encompassing rich structural and underlying semantic contextual information, resulting in a challenging problem in efficiently segmenting a point cloud. Most existing researches mainly focus on capturing intricate local features without giving due consideration to global ones, thus failing to leverage semantic context. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Weighted Convolution and local-global Fusion Network, named SWCF-Net, which takes into account both local and global features. We propose a Similarity-Weighted Convolution (SWConv) to effectively extract local features, where similarity weights are incorporated into the convolution operation to enhance the generalization capabilities. Then, we employ a downsampling operation on the K and V channels within the attention module, thereby reducing the quadratic complexity to linear, enabling the Transformer to deal with large-scale point clouds. At last, orthogonal components are extracted in the global features and then aggregated with local features, thereby eliminating redundant information between local and global features and consequently promoting efficiency. We evaluate SWCF-Net on large-scale outdoor datasets SemanticKITTI and Toronto3D. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network. Our method achieves a competitive result with less computational cost, and is able to handle large-scale point clouds efficiently.</description>

      <title>PrAViC: Probabilistic Adaptation Framework for Real-Time Video Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. The latter is often driven by the need to identify rapidly potential critical or dangerous situations. These could include machine failure, traffic accidents, heart problems, or dangerous behavior. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this, we present \our{}, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for dealing with the online classification problem for video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a robust mathematical foundation for the theory of classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return an outcome much faster. The subsequent phase is to demonstrate a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to online and recurrent operations. Finally, by comparing the proposed approach to the non-online state-of-the-art baseline, it is demonstrated that the use of \our{} encourages the network to make earlier classification decisions without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Solving the Inverse Problem of Electrocardiography for Cardiac Digital Twins: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac digital twins are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex heart mechanisms. Solving the ECG inverse problem is crucial for accurate virtual heart modelling, enabling the derivation of internal electrical activity information from recorded surface potentials. Despite challenges from cardiac complexity, noisy ECG data, and computational efficiency, recent advancements hold significant promise for enhancing virtual heart modelling, ultimately advancing precision medicine in cardiology. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods of solving ECG inverse problem, the validation strategies, the clinical applications, and future perspectives. For the computing methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in cardiac digital twins.</description>

      <title>MedThink: Inducing Medical Large-scale Visual Language Models to Hallucinate Less by Thinking More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11451v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are applied to multimodal medical generative tasks, they suffer from significant model hallucination issues. This severely impairs the model's generative accuracy, making it challenging for LVLMs to be implemented in real-world medical scenarios to assist doctors in diagnosis. Enhancing the training data for downstream medical generative tasks is an effective way to address model hallucination. Moreover, the limited availability of training data in the medical field and privacy concerns greatly hinder the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that mimics human cognitive processes to construct fine-grained instruction pairs and apply the concept of chain-of-thought (CoT) from inference scenarios to training scenarios, thereby proposing a method called MedThink. Our experiments on various LVLMs demonstrate that our novel data construction method tailored for the medical domain significantly improves the model's performance in medical image report generation tasks and substantially mitigates the hallucinations. All resources of this work will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Learning from Exemplars for Interactive Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive image segmentation enables users to interact minimally with a machine, facilitating the gradual refinement of the segmentation mask for a target of interest. Previous studies have demonstrated impressive performance in extracting a single target mask through interactive segmentation. However, the information cues of previously interacted objects have been overlooked in the existing methods, which can be further explored to speed up interactive segmentation for multiple targets in the same category. To this end, we introduce novel interactive segmentation frameworks for both a single object and multiple objects in the same category. Specifically, our model leverages transformer backbones to extract interaction-focused visual features from the image and the interactions to obtain a satisfactory mask of a target as an exemplar. For multiple objects, we propose an exemplar-informed module to enhance the learning of similarities among the objects of the target category. To combine attended features from different modules, we incorporate cross-attention blocks followed by a feature fusion module. Experiments conducted on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that our models achieve superior performance compared to previous methods. Particularly, our model reduces users' labor by around 15\%, requiring two fewer clicks to achieve target IoUs 85\% and 90\%. The results highlight our models' potential as a flexible and practical annotation tool. The source code will be released after publication.</description>

      <title>GeoGPT4V: Towards Geometric Multi-modal Large Language Models with Geometric Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have seen widespread adoption in math problem-solving. However, in geometry problems that usually require visual aids for better understanding, even the most advanced multi-modal models currently still face challenges in effectively using image information. High-quality data is crucial for enhancing the geometric capabilities of multi-modal models, yet existing open-source datasets and related efforts are either too challenging for direct model learning or suffer from misalignment between text and images. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and GPT-4V to generate relatively basic geometry problems with aligned text and images, facilitating model learning. We have produced a dataset of 4.9K geometry problems and combined it with 19K open-source data to form our GeoGPT4V dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the GeoGPT4V dataset significantly improves the geometry performance of various models on the MathVista and MathVision benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Lanyu0303/GeoGPT4V_Project</description>

      <title>Prior Normality Prompt Transformer for Multi-class Industrial Image Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in industrial inspection. Traditional approaches often demand distinct models for specific categories, resulting in substantial deployment costs. This raises concerns about multi-class anomaly detection, where a unified model is developed for multiple classes. However, applying conventional methods, particularly reconstruction-based models, directly to multi-class scenarios encounters challenges such as identical shortcut learning, hindering effective discrimination between normal and abnormal instances. To tackle this issue, our study introduces the Prior Normality Prompt Transformer (PNPT) method for multi-class image anomaly detection. PNPT strategically incorporates normal semantics prompting to mitigate the "identical mapping" problem. This entails integrating a prior normality prompt into the reconstruction process, yielding a dual-stream model. This innovative architecture combines normal prior semantics with abnormal samples, enabling dual-stream reconstruction grounded in both prior knowledge and intrinsic sample characteristics. PNPT comprises four essential modules: Class-Specific Normality Prompting Pool (CS-NPP), Hierarchical Patch Embedding (HPE), Semantic Alignment Coupling Encoding (SACE), and Contextual Semantic Conditional Decoding (CSCD). Experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets and real-world industrial applications highlights PNPT's superior performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>HyperSIGMA: Hyperspectral Intelligence Comprehension Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are revolutionizing the analysis and understanding of remote sensing (RS) scenes, including aerial RGB, multispectral, and SAR images. However, hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are rich in spectral information, have not seen much application of FMs, with existing methods often restricted to specific tasks and lacking generality. To fill this gap, we introduce HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model for HSI interpretation, scalable to over a billion parameters. To tackle the spectral and spatial redundancy challenges in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, and real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Inpainting the Gaps: A Novel Framework for Evaluating Explanation Methods in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbation test remains the go-to evaluation approach for explanation methods in computer vision. This evaluation method has a major drawback of test-time distribution shift due to pixel-masking that is not present in the training set. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel evaluation framework called \textbf{Inpainting the Gaps (InG)}. Specifically, we propose inpainting parts that constitute partial or complete objects in an image. In this way, one can perform meaningful image perturbations with lower test-time distribution shifts, thereby improving the efficacy of the perturbation test. InG is applied to the PartImageNet dataset to evaluate the performance of popular explanation methods for three training strategies of the Vision Transformer (ViT). Based on this evaluation, we found Beyond Intuition and Generic Attribution to be the two most consistent explanation models. Further, and interestingly, the proposed framework results in higher and more consistent evaluation scores across all the ViT models considered in this work. To the best of our knowledge, InG is the first semi-synthetic framework for the evaluation of ViT explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Quality Control of Whole Slide Images by Explicit Artifact Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of artifacts in whole slide image acquisition, prevalent in both clinical workflows and research-oriented settings, necessitates human intervention and re-scanning. Overcoming this challenge requires developing quality control algorithms, that are hindered by the limited availability of relevant annotated data in histopathology. The manual annotation of ground-truth for artifact detection methods is expensive and time-consuming. This work addresses the issue by proposing a method dedicated to augmenting whole slide images with artifacts. The tool seamlessly generates and blends artifacts from an external library to a given histopathology dataset. The augmented datasets are then utilized to train artifact classification methods. The evaluation shows their usefulness in classification of the artifacts, where they show an improvement from 0.10 to 0.01 AUROC depending on the artifact type. The framework, model, weights, and ground-truth annotations are freely released to facilitate open science and reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Simple Yet Efficient: Towards Self-Supervised FG-SBIR with Unified Sample Feature Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) aims to minimize the distance between sketches and corresponding images in the embedding space. However, scalability is hindered by the growing complexity of solutions, mainly due to the abstract nature of fine-grained sketches. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to narrow the gap between the two modes. It mainly facilitates unified mutual information sharing both intra- and inter-samples, rather than treating them as a single feature alignment problem between modalities. Specifically, our approach includes: (i) Employing dual weight-sharing networks to optimize alignment within sketch and image domain, which also effectively mitigates model learning saturation issues. (ii) Introducing an objective optimization function based on contrastive loss to enhance the model's ability to align features intra- and inter-samples. (iii) Presenting a learnable TRSM combined of self-attention and cross-attention to promote feature representations among tokens, further enhancing sample alignment in the embedding space. Our framework achieves excellent results on CNN- and ViT-based backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. We also introduce Cloths-V1, the first professional fashion sketches and images dataset, utilized to validate our method and will be beneficial for other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color image inpainting is a challenging task in imaging science. The existing method is based on real operation, and the red, green and blue channels of the color image are processed separately, ignoring the correlation between each channel. In order to make full use of the correlation between each channel, this paper proposes a Quaternion Generative Adversarial Neural Network (QGAN) model and related theory, and applies it to solve the problem of color image inpainting with large area missing. Firstly, the definition of quaternion deconvolution is given and the quaternion batch normalization is proposed. Secondly, the above two innovative modules are applied to generate adversarial networks to improve stability. Finally, QGAN is applied to color image inpainting and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that QGAN has superiority in color image inpainting with large area missing.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Feature Maps: A Graph Convolutional Approach for Enhancing Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to adversarial perturbations presents significant security concerns, as the imperceptible perturbations can contaminate the feature space and lead to incorrect predictions. Recent studies have attempted to calibrate contaminated features by either suppressing or over-activating particular channels. Despite these efforts, we claim that adversarial attacks exhibit varying disruption levels across individual channels. Furthermore, we argue that harmonizing feature maps via graph and employing graph convolution can calibrate contaminated features. To this end, we introduce an innovative plug-and-play module called Feature Map-based Reconstructed Graph Convolution (FMR-GC). FMR-GC harmonizes feature maps in the channel dimension to reconstruct the graph, then employs graph convolution to capture neighborhood information, effectively calibrating contaminated features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance and scalability of FMR-GC. Moreover, our model can be combined with advanced adversarial training methods to considerably enhance robustness without compromising the model's clean accuracy.</description>

      <title>Duoduo CLIP: Efficient 3D Understanding with Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Duoduo CLIP, a model for 3D representation learning that learns shape encodings from multi-view images instead of point-clouds. The choice of multi-view images allows us to leverage 2D priors from off-the-shelf CLIP models to facilitate fine-tuning with 3D data. Our approach not only shows better generalization compared to existing point cloud methods, but also reduces GPU requirements and training time. In addition, we modify the model with cross-view attention to leverage information across multiple frames of the object which further boosts performance. Compared to the current SOTA point cloud method that requires 480 A100 hours to train 1 billion model parameters we only require 57 A5000 hours and 87 million parameters. Multi-view images also provide more flexibility in use cases compared to point clouds. This includes being able to encode objects with a variable number of images, with better performance when more views are used. This is in contrast to point cloud based methods, where an entire scan or model of an object is required. We showcase this flexibility with object retrieval from images of real-world objects. Our model also achieves better performance in more fine-grained text to shape retrieval, demonstrating better text-and-shape alignment than point cloud based models.</description>

      <title>ChildDiffusion: Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI and Controllable Augmentations for Child Facial Data using Stable Diffusion and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research work we have proposed high-level ChildDiffusion framework capable of generating photorealistic child facial samples and further embedding several intelligent augmentations on child facial data using short text prompts, detailed textual guidance from LLMs, and further image to image transformation using text guidance control conditioning thus providing an opportunity to curate fully synthetic large scale child datasets. The framework is validated by rendering high-quality child faces representing ethnicity data, micro expressions, face pose variations, eye blinking effects, facial accessories, different hair colours and styles, aging, multiple and different child gender subjects in a single frame. Addressing privacy concerns regarding child data acquisition requires a comprehensive approach that involves legal, ethical, and technological considerations. Keeping this in view this framework can be adapted to synthesise child facial data which can be effectively used for numerous downstream machine learning tasks. The proposed method circumvents common issues encountered in generative AI tools, such as temporal inconsistency and limited control over the rendered outputs. As an exemplary use case we have open-sourced child ethnicity data consisting of 2.5k child facial samples of five different classes which includes African, Asian, White, South Asian/ Indian, and Hispanic races by deploying the model in production inference phase. The rendered data undergoes rigorous qualitative as well as quantitative tests to cross validate its efficacy and further fine-tuning Yolo architecture for detecting and classifying child ethnicity as an exemplary downstream machine learning task.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Semantic Classification by Grounding on Consistent Image Segmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical semantic classification requires the prediction of a taxonomy tree instead of a single flat level of the tree, where both accuracies at individual levels and consistency across levels matter. We can train classifiers for individual levels, which has accuracy but not consistency, or we can train only the finest level classification and infer higher levels, which has consistency but not accuracy. Our key insight is that hierarchical recognition should not be treated as multi-task classification, as each level is essentially a different task and they would have to compromise with each other, but be grounded on image segmentations that are consistent across semantic granularities. Consistency can in fact improve accuracy. We build upon recent work on learning hierarchical segmentation for flat-level recognition, and extend it to hierarchical recognition. It naturally captures the intuition that fine-grained recognition requires fine image segmentation whereas coarse-grained recognition requires coarse segmentation; they can all be integrated into one recognition model that drives fine-to-coarse internal visual parsing.Additionally, we introduce a Tree-path KL Divergence loss to enforce consistent accurate predictions across levels. Our extensive experimentation and analysis demonstrate our significant gains on predicting an accurate and consistent taxonomy tree.</description>

      <title>DocGenome: An Open Large-scale Scientific Document Benchmark for Training and Testing Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific documents record research findings and valuable human knowledge, comprising a vast corpus of high-quality data. Leveraging multi-modality data extracted from these documents and assessing large models' abilities to handle scientific document-oriented tasks is therefore meaningful. Despite promising advancements, large models still perform poorly on multi-page scientific document extraction and understanding tasks, and their capacity to process within-document data formats such as charts and equations remains under-explored. To address these issues, we present DocGenome, a structured document benchmark constructed by annotating 500K scientific documents from 153 disciplines in the arXiv open-access community, using our custom auto-labeling pipeline. DocGenome features four key characteristics: 1) Completeness: It is the first dataset to structure data from all modalities including 13 layout attributes along with their LaTeX source codes. 2) Logicality: It provides 6 logical relationships between different entities within each scientific document. 3) Diversity: It covers various document-oriented tasks, including document classification, visual grounding, document layout detection, document transformation, open-ended single-page QA and multi-page QA. 4) Correctness: It undergoes rigorous quality control checks conducted by a specialized team. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of DocGenome and objectively evaluate the performance of large models on our benchmark.</description>

      <title>YOLO-FEDER FusionNet: A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Drone Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predominant methods for image-based drone detection frequently rely on employing generic object detection algorithms like YOLOv5. While proficient in identifying drones against homogeneous backgrounds, these algorithms often struggle in complex, highly textured environments. In such scenarios, drones seamlessly integrate into the background, creating camouflage effects that adversely affect the detection quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture called YOLO-FEDER FusionNet. Unlike conventional approaches, YOLO-FEDER FusionNet combines generic object detection methods with the specialized strength of camouflage object detection techniques to enhance drone detection capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet show the efficiency of the proposed model and demonstrate substantial improvements in both reducing missed detections and false alarms.</description>

      <title>AnyMaker: Zero-shot General Object Customization via Decoupled Dual-Level ID Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image based object customization, aiming to generate images with the same identity (ID) as objects of interest in accordance with text prompts and reference images, has made significant progress. However, recent customizing research is dominated by specialized tasks, such as human customization or virtual try-on, leaving a gap in general object customization. To this end, we introduce AnyMaker, an innovative zero-shot object customization framework capable of generating general objects with high ID fidelity and flexible text editability. The efficacy of AnyMaker stems from its novel general ID extraction, dual-level ID injection, and ID-aware decoupling. Specifically, the general ID extraction module extracts sufficient ID information with an ensemble of self-supervised models to tackle the diverse customization tasks for general objects. Then, to provide the diffusion UNet with the extracted ID as much while not damaging the text editability in the generation process, we design a global-local dual-level ID injection module, in which the global-level semantic ID is injected into text descriptions while the local-level ID details are injected directly into the model through newly added cross-attention modules. In addition, we propose an ID-aware decoupling module to disentangle ID-related information from non-ID elements in the extracted representations for high-fidelity generation of both identity and text descriptions. To validate our approach and boost the research of general object customization, we create the first large-scale general ID dataset, Multi-Category ID-Consistent (MC-IDC) dataset, with 315k text-image samples and 10k categories. Experiments show that AnyMaker presents remarkable performance in general object customization and outperforms specialized methods in corresponding tasks. Code and dataset will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Effective Rank Analysis and Regularization for Enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11672v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision and graphics. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges, including needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals, due to the Gaussians converging into anisotropic Gaussians with one dominant variance. We propose using effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Model Pre-training via Language Guided Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of pre-training for small models, which is essential for many mobile devices. Current state-of-the-art methods on this problem transfer the representational knowledge of a large network (as a Teacher) into a smaller model (as a Student) using self-supervised distillation, improving the performance of the small model on downstream tasks. However, existing approaches are insufficient in extracting the crucial knowledge that is useful for discerning categories in downstream tasks during the distillation process. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce language guidance to the distillation process and propose a new method named Language-Guided Distillation (LGD) system, which uses category names of the target downstream task to help refine the knowledge transferred between the teacher and student. To this end, we utilize a pre-trained text encoder to extract semantic embeddings from language and construct a textual semantic space called Textual Semantics Bank (TSB). Furthermore, we design a Language-Guided Knowledge Aggregation (LGKA) module to construct the visual semantic space, also named Visual Semantics Bank (VSB). The task-related knowledge is transferred by driving a student encoder to mimic the similarity score distribution inferred by a teacher over TSB and VSB. Compared with other small models obtained by either ImageNet pre-training or self-supervised distillation, experiment results show that the distilled lightweight model using the proposed LGD method presents state-of-the-art performance and is validated on various downstream tasks, including classification, detection, and segmentation. We have made the code available at https://github.com/mZhenz/LGD.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth completion is the task of generating a dense depth map given an image and a sparse depth map as inputs. It has important applications in various downstream tasks. In this paper, we present OGNI-DC, a novel framework for depth completion. The key to our method is "Optimization-Guided Neural Iterations" (OGNI). It consists of a recurrent unit that refines a depth gradient field and a differentiable depth integrator that integrates the depth gradients into a depth map. OGNI-DC exhibits strong generalization, outperforming baselines by a large margin on unseen datasets and across various sparsity levels. Moreover, OGNI-DC has high accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and the KITTI benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/OGNI-DC.</description>

      <title>Latent Denoising Diffusion GAN: Faster sampling, Higher image quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are emerging as powerful solutions for generating high-fidelity and diverse images, often surpassing GANs under many circumstances. However, their slow inference speed hinders their potential for real-time applications. To address this, DiffusionGAN leveraged a conditional GAN to drastically reduce the denoising steps and speed up inference. Its advancement, Wavelet Diffusion, further accelerated the process by converting data into wavelet space, thus enhancing efficiency. Nonetheless, these models still fall short of GANs in terms of speed and image quality. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces the Latent Denoising Diffusion GAN, which employs pre-trained autoencoders to compress images into a compact latent space, significantly improving inference speed and image quality. Furthermore, we propose a Weighted Learning strategy to enhance diversity and image quality. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and LSUN-Church datasets prove that our model achieves state-of-the-art running speed among diffusion models. Compared to its predecessors, DiffusionGAN and Wavelet Diffusion, our model shows remarkable improvements in all evaluation metrics.

      <title>Correspondence Free Multivector Cloud Registration using Conformal Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, for the first time, a novel theoretical approach to address the problem of correspondence free multivector cloud registration in conformal geometric algebra. Such formalism achieves several favorable properties. Primarily, it forms an orthogonal automorphism that extends beyond the typical vector space to the entire conformal geometric algebra while respecting the multivector grading. Concretely, the registration can be viewed as an orthogonal transformation (\it i.e., scale, translation, rotation) belonging to $SO(4,1)$ - group of special orthogonal transformations in conformal geometric algebra. We will show that such formalism is able to: $(i)$ perform the registration without directly accessing the input multivectors. Instead, we use primitives or geometric objects provided by the conformal model - the multivectors, $(ii)$ the geometric objects are obtained by solving a multilinear eigenvalue problem to find sets of eigenmultivectors. In this way, we can explicitly avoid solving the correspondences in the registration process. Most importantly, this offers rotation and translation equivariant properties between the input multivectors and the eigenmultivectors. Experimental evaluation is conducted in datasets commonly used in point cloud registration, to testify the usefulness of the approach with emphasis to ambiguities arising from high levels of noise. The code is available at https://github.com/Numerical-Geometric-Algebra/RegistrationGA . This work was submitted to the International Journal of Computer Vision and is currently under review.</description>

      <title>InterNeRF: Scaling Radiance Fields via Parameter Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have unmatched fidelity on large, real-world scenes. A common approach for scaling NeRFs is to partition the scene into regions, each of which is assigned its own parameters. When implemented naively, such an approach is limited by poor test-time scaling and inconsistent appearance and geometry. We instead propose InterNeRF, a novel architecture for rendering a target view using a subset of the model's parameters. Our approach enables out-of-core training and rendering, increasing total model capacity with only a modest increase to training time. We demonstrate significant improvements in multi-room scenes while remaining competitive on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>V3Det Challenge 2024 on Vast Vocabulary and Open Vocabulary Object Detection: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting objects in real-world scenes is a complex task due to various challenges, including the vast range of object categories, and potential encounters with previously unknown or unseen objects. The challenges necessitate the development of public benchmarks and challenges to advance the field of object detection. Inspired by the success of previous COCO and LVIS Challenges, we organize the V3Det Challenge 2024 in conjunction with the 4th Open World Vision Workshop: Visual Perception via Learning in an Open World (VPLOW) at CVPR 2024, Seattle, US. This challenge aims to push the boundaries of object detection research and encourage innovation in this field. The V3Det Challenge 2024 consists of two tracks: 1) Vast Vocabulary Object Detection: This track focuses on detecting objects from a large set of 13204 categories, testing the detection algorithm's ability to recognize and locate diverse objects. 2) Open Vocabulary Object Detection: This track goes a step further, requiring algorithms to detect objects from an open set of categories, including unknown objects. In the following sections, we will provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of the solutions submitted by participants. By analyzing the methods and solutions presented, we aim to inspire future research directions in vast vocabulary and open-vocabulary object detection, driving progress in this field.

      <title>Domain Generalization for In-Orbit 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, of a target spacecraft, from a monocular image, a key capability for future autonomous Rendezvous and Proximity Operations. Due to the difficulty of acquiring large sets of real images, spacecraft pose estimation networks are exclusively trained on synthetic ones. However, because those images do not capture the illumination conditions encountered in orbit, pose estimation networks face a domain gap problem, i.e., they do not generalize to real images. Our work introduces a method that bridges this domain gap. It relies on a novel, end-to-end, neural-based architecture as well as a novel learning strategy. This strategy improves the domain generalization abilities of the network through multi-task learning and aggressive data augmentation policies, thereby enforcing the network to learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that our method effectively closes the domain gap, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the widespread SPEED+ dataset. Finally, ablation studies assess the impact of key components of our method on its generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>Matching Query Image Against Selected NeRF Feature for Efficient and Scalable Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural implicit representations such as NeRF have revolutionized 3D scene representation with photo-realistic quality. However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.</description>

      <title>Solving Vision Tasks with Simple Photoreceptors Instead of Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A de facto standard in solving computer vision problems is to use a common high-resolution camera and choose its placement on an agent (i.e., position and orientation) based on human intuition. On the other hand, extremely simple and well-designed visual sensors found throughout nature allow many organisms to perform diverse, complex behaviors. In this work, motivated by these examples, we raise the following questions: 1. How effective simple visual sensors are in solving vision tasks? 2. What role does their design play in their effectiveness? We explore simple sensors with resolutions as low as one-by-one pixel, representing a single photoreceptor First, we demonstrate that just a few photoreceptors can be enough to solve many tasks, such as visual navigation and continuous control, reasonably well, with performance comparable to that of a high-resolution camera. Second, we show that the design of these simple visual sensors plays a crucial role in their ability to provide useful information and successfully solve these tasks. To find a well-performing design, we present a computational design optimization algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness across different tasks and domains, showing promising results. Finally, we perform a human survey to evaluate the effectiveness of intuitive designs devised manually by humans, showing that the computationally found design is among the best designs in most cases.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning methodology for the identification of wood species using high-resolution macroscopic images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements in the field of wood species identification are needed worldwide to support sustainable timber trade. In this work we contribute to automate the identification of wood species via high-resolution macroscopic images of timber. The main challenge of this problem is that fine-grained patterns in timber are crucial in order to accurately identify wood species, and these patterns are not properly learned by traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on low/medium resolution images.
  We propose a Timber Deep Learning Identification with Patch-based Inference Voting methodology, abbreviated TDLI-PIV methodology. Our proposal exploits the concept of patching and the availability of high-resolution macroscopic images of timber in order to overcome the inherent challenges that CNNs face in timber identification. The TDLI-PIV methodology is able to capture fine-grained patterns in timber and, moreover, boosts robustness and prediction accuracy via a collaborative voting inference process.
  In this work we also introduce a new data set of marcroscopic images of timber, called GOIMAI-Phase-I, which has been obtained using optical magnification in order to capture fine-grained details, which contrasts to the other datasets that are publicly available. More concretely, images in GOIMAI-Phase-I are taken with a smartphone with a 24x magnifying lens attached to the camera. Our data set contains 2120 images of timber and covers 37 legally protected wood species.
  Our experiments have assessed the performance of the TDLI-PIV methodology, involving the comparison with other methodologies available in the literature, exploration of data augmentation methods and the effect that the dataset size has on the accuracy of TDLI-PIV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks for large multimodal language models (MLMs) now serve to simultaneously assess the general capabilities of models instead of evaluating for a specific capability. As a result, when a developer wants to identify which models to use for their application, they are overwhelmed by the number of benchmarks and remain uncertain about which benchmark's results are most reflective of their specific use case. This paper introduces Task-Me-Anything, a benchmark generation engine which produces a benchmark tailored to a user's needs. Task-Me-Anything maintains an extendable taxonomy of visual assets and can programmatically generate a vast number of task instances. Additionally, it algorithmically addresses user queries regarding MLM performance efficiently within a computational budget. It contains 113K images, 10K videos, 2K 3D object assets, over 365 object categories, 655 attributes, and 335 relationships. It can generate 750M image/video question-answering pairs, which focus on evaluating MLM perceptual capabilities. Task-Me-Anything reveals critical insights: open-source MLMs excel in object and attribute recognition but lack spatial and temporal understanding; each model exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses; larger models generally perform better, though exceptions exist; and GPT4o demonstrates challenges in recognizing rotating/moving objects and distinguishing colors.</description>

      <title>PhyBench: A Physical Commonsense Benchmark for Evaluating Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have made substantial progress in generating images from textual prompts. However, they frequently fail to produce images consistent with physical commonsense, a vital capability for applications in world simulation and everyday tasks. Current T2I evaluation benchmarks focus on metrics such as accuracy, bias, and safety, neglecting the evaluation of models' internal knowledge, particularly physical commonsense. To address this issue, we introduce PhyBench, a comprehensive T2I evaluation dataset comprising 700 prompts across 4 primary categories: mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, and material properties, encompassing 31 distinct physical scenarios. We assess 6 prominent T2I models, including proprietary models DALLE3 and Gemini, and demonstrate that incorporating physical principles into prompts enhances the models' ability to generate physically accurate images. Our findings reveal that: (1) even advanced models frequently err in various physical scenarios, except for optics; (2) GPT-4o, with item-specific scoring instructions, effectively evaluates the models' understanding of physical commonsense, closely aligning with human assessments; and (3) current T2I models are primarily focused on text-to-image translation, lacking profound reasoning regarding physical commonsense. We advocate for increased attention to the inherent knowledge within T2I models, beyond their utility as mere image generation tools. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PhyBench.</description>

      <title>Faces of Experimental Pain: Transferability of Deep Learned Heat Pain Features to Electrical Pain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited size of pain datasets are a challenge in developing robust deep learning models for pain recognition. Transfer learning approaches are often employed in these scenarios. In this study, we investigate whether deep learned feature representation for one type of experimentally induced pain can be transferred to another. Participating in the AI4Pain challenge, our goal is to classify three levels of pain (No-Pain, Low-Pain, High-Pain). The challenge dataset contains data collected from 65 participants undergoing varying intensities of electrical pain. We utilize the video recording from the dataset to investigate the transferability of deep learned heat pain model to electrical pain. In our proposed approach, we leverage an existing heat pain convolutional neural network (CNN) - trained on BioVid dataset - as a feature extractor. The images from the challenge dataset are inputted to the pre-trained heat pain CNN to obtain feature vectors. These feature vectors are used to train two machine learning models: a simple feed-forward neural network and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our approach was tested using the dataset's predefined training, validation, and testing splits. Our models outperformed the baseline of the challenge on both the validation and tests sets, highlighting the potential of models trained on other pain datasets for reliable feature extraction.</description>

      <title>VideoLLM-online: Online Video Large Language Model for Streaming Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Models have been enhanced with vision capabilities, enabling them to comprehend images, videos, and interleaved vision-language content. However, the learning methods of these large multimodal models typically treat videos as predetermined clips, making them less effective and efficient at handling streaming video inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning-In-Video-Stream (LIVE) framework, which enables temporally aligned, long-context, and real-time conversation within a continuous video stream. Our LIVE framework comprises comprehensive approaches to achieve video streaming dialogue, encompassing: (1) a training objective designed to perform language modeling for continuous streaming inputs, (2) a data generation scheme that converts offline temporal annotations into a streaming dialogue format, and (3) an optimized inference pipeline to speed up the model responses in real-world video streams. With our LIVE framework, we built VideoLLM-online model upon Llama-2/Llama-3 and demonstrate its significant advantages in processing streaming videos. For instance, on average, our model can support streaming dialogue in a 5-minute video clip at over 10 FPS on an A100 GPU. Moreover, it also showcases state-of-the-art performance on public offline video benchmarks, such as recognition, captioning, and forecasting. The code, model, data, and demo have been made available at https://showlab.github.io/videollm-online.</description>

      <title>MegaScenes: Scene-Level View Synthesis at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene-level novel view synthesis (NVS) is fundamental to many vision and graphics applications. Recently, pose-conditioned diffusion models have led to significant progress by extracting 3D information from 2D foundation models, but these methods are limited by the lack of scene-level training data. Common dataset choices either consist of isolated objects (Objaverse), or of object-centric scenes with limited pose distributions (DTU, CO3D). In this paper, we create a large-scale scene-level dataset from Internet photo collections, called MegaScenes, which contains over 100K structure from motion (SfM) reconstructions from around the world. Internet photos represent a scalable data source but come with challenges such as lighting and transient objects. We address these issues to further create a subset suitable for the task of NVS. Additionally, we analyze failure cases of state-of-the-art NVS methods and significantly improve generation consistency. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of both our dataset and method on generating in-the-wild scenes. For details on the dataset and code, see our project page at https://megascenes.github.io .</description>

      <title>Composing Object Relations and Attributes for Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the visual semantic embedding problem for image-text matching. Most existing work utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism to perform local alignment across the two image and text modalities. This is computationally expensive, even though it is more powerful than the unimodal dual-encoder approach. This work introduces a dual-encoder image-text matching model, leveraging a scene graph to represent captions with nodes for objects and attributes interconnected by relational edges. Utilizing a graph attention network, our model efficiently encodes object-attribute and object-object semantic relations, resulting in a robust and fast-performing system. Representing caption as a scene graph offers the ability to utilize the strong relational inductive bias of graph neural networks to learn object-attribute and object-object relations effectively. To train the model, we propose losses that align the image and caption both at the holistic level (image-caption) and the local level (image-object entity), which we show is key to the success of the model. Our model is termed Composition model for Object Relations and Attributes, CORA. Experimental results on two prominent image-text retrieval benchmarks, Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate that CORA outperforms existing state-of-the-art computationally expensive cross-attention methods regarding recall score while achieving fast computation speed of the dual encoder.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Language and Vision Assistants for Visually-Situated Natural Language Understanding: What Matters in Reading and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language and vision assistants have showcased impressive capabilities but suffer from a lack of transparency, limiting broader research and reproducibility. While open-source models handle general image tasks effectively, they face challenges with the high computational demands of complex visually-situated text understanding. Such tasks often require increased token inputs and large vision modules to harness high-resolution information. Striking a balance between model size and data importance remains an open question. This study aims to redefine the design of vision-language models by identifying key components and creating efficient models with constrained inference costs. By strategically formulating datasets, optimizing vision modules, and enhancing supervision techniques, we achieve significant improvements in inference throughput while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments across models ranging from 160M to 13B parameters offer insights into model optimization. We will fully open-source our codebase, models, and datasets at https://github.com/naver-ai/elva .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Infinigen Indoors, a Blender-based procedural generator of photorealistic indoor scenes. It builds upon the existing Infinigen system, which focuses on natural scenes, but expands its coverage to indoor scenes by introducing a diverse library of procedural indoor assets, including furniture, architecture elements, appliances, and other day-to-day objects. It also introduces a constraint-based arrangement system, which consists of a domain-specific language for expressing diverse constraints on scene composition, and a solver that generates scene compositions that maximally satisfy the constraints. We provide an export tool that allows the generated 3D objects and scenes to be directly used for training embodied agents in real-time simulators such as Omniverse and Unreal. Infinigen Indoors is open-sourced under the BSD license. Please visit https://infinigen.org for code and videos.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Prompt Encoding for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models. However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework. Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DiT across model size and data size. Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. The powerful LI-DiT-10B will be available after further optimization and security checks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Encoder-Free Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/baaivision/EVE.</description>

      <title>MMDU: A Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialog Understanding Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset for LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating natural and meaningful responses to communicate with multi-modal human inputs is a fundamental capability of Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs). While current open-source LVLMs demonstrate promising performance in simplified scenarios such as single-turn single-image input, they fall short in real-world conversation scenarios such as following instructions in a long context history with multi-turn and multi-images. Existing LVLM benchmarks primarily focus on single-choice questions or short-form responses, which do not adequately assess the capabilities of LVLMs in real-world human-AI interaction applications. Therefore, we introduce MMDU, a comprehensive benchmark, and MMDU-45k, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset, designed to evaluate and improve LVLMs' abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations. We employ the clustering algorithm to ffnd the relevant images and textual descriptions from the open-source Wikipedia and construct the question-answer pairs by human annotators with the assistance of the GPT-4o model. MMDU has a maximum of 18k image+text tokens, 20 images, and 27 turns, which is at least 5x longer than previous benchmarks and poses challenges to current LVLMs. Our in-depth analysis of 15 representative LVLMs using MMDU reveals that open-source LVLMs lag behind closed-source counterparts due to limited conversational instruction tuning data. We demonstrate that ffne-tuning open-source LVLMs on MMDU-45k signiffcantly address this gap, generating longer and more accurate conversations, and improving scores on MMDU and existing benchmarks (MMStar: +1.1%, MathVista: +1.5%, ChartQA:+1.2%). Our contributions pave the way for bridging the gap between current LVLM models and real-world application demands. This project is available at https://github.com/Liuziyu77/MMDU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles require a precise understanding of their environment to navigate safely. Reliable identification of unknown objects, especially those that are absent during training, such as wild animals, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been driven by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we have extended the most commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation task. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation methods shows that this challenge remains an unsolved problem. The benchmark website and the competition page can be found at: https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/oodis .</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of training high-parameter 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) models on large-scale, high-resolution datasets. We design a general model parallel training method for 3DGS, named RetinaGS, which uses a proper rendering equation and can be applied to any scene and arbitrary distribution of Gaussian primitives. It enables us to explore the scaling behavior of 3DGS in terms of primitive numbers and training resolutions that were difficult to explore before and surpass previous state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We observe a clear positive trend of increasing visual quality when increasing primitive numbers with our method. We also demonstrate the first attempt at training a 3DGS model with more than one billion primitives on the full MatrixCity dataset that attains a promising visual quality.</description>

      <title>Scaling the Codebook Size of VQGAN to 100,000 with a Utilization Rate of 99%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of image quantization exemplified by VQGAN, the process encodes images into discrete tokens drawn from a codebook with a predefined size. Recent advancements, particularly with LLAMA 3, reveal that enlarging the codebook significantly enhances model performance. However, VQGAN and its derivatives, such as VQGAN-FC (Factorized Codes) and VQGAN-EMA, continue to grapple with challenges related to expanding the codebook size and enhancing codebook utilization. For instance, VQGAN-FC is restricted to learning a codebook with a maximum size of 16,384, maintaining a typically low utilization rate of less than 12% on ImageNet. In this work, we propose a novel image quantization model named VQGAN-LC (Large Codebook), which extends the codebook size to 100,000, achieving an utilization rate exceeding 99%. Unlike previous methods that optimize each codebook entry, our approach begins with a codebook initialized with 100,000 features extracted by a pre-trained vision encoder. Optimization then focuses on training a projector that aligns the entire codebook with the feature distributions of the encoder in VQGAN-LC. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model over its counterparts across a variety of tasks, including image reconstruction, image classification, auto-regressive image generation using GPT, and image creation with diffusion- and flow-based generative models. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zh460045050/VQGAN-LC.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Image Generation without Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that autoregressive models for image generation are typically accompanied by vector-quantized tokens. We observe that while a discrete-valued space can facilitate representing a categorical distribution, it is not a necessity for autoregressive modeling. In this work, we propose to model the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, which allows us to apply autoregressive models in a continuous-valued space. Rather than using categorical cross-entropy loss, we define a Diffusion Loss function to model the per-token probability. This approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. We evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of cases, including standard autoregressive models and generalized masked autoregressive (MAR) variants. By removing vector quantization, our image generator achieves strong results while enjoying the speed advantage of sequence modeling. We hope this work will motivate the use of autoregressive generation in other continuous-valued domains and applications.</description>

      <title>mDPO: Conditional Preference Optimization for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) has shown to be an effective method for large language model (LLM) alignment. Recent works have attempted to apply DPO to multimodal scenarios but have found it challenging to achieve consistent improvement. Through a comparative experiment, we identify the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization, where the model overlooks the image condition. To address this problem, we propose mDPO, a multimodal DPO objective that prevents the over-prioritization of language-only preferences by also optimizing image preference. Moreover, we introduce a reward anchor that forces the reward to be positive for chosen responses, thereby avoiding the decrease in their likelihood -- an intrinsic problem of relative preference optimization. Experiments on two multimodal LLMs of different sizes and three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that mDPO effectively addresses the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization and significantly improves model performance, particularly in reducing hallucination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of images and 3D data. However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&amp;A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in predicting $\geq$M-class solar flares with a prediction window of 24 hours, using hourly sampled full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images, particularly focusing on the often overlooked flare events corresponding to the near-limb regions (beyond $\pm$70$^{\circ}$ of the solar disk). We trained three well-known deep learning architectures--AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet34 using transfer learning and compared and evaluated the overall performance of our models using true skill statistics (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS) and computed recall scores to understand the prediction sensitivity in central and near-limb regions for both X- and M-class flares. The following points summarize the key findings of our study: (1) The highest overall performance was observed with the AlexNet-based model, which achieved an average TSS$\sim$0.53 and HSS$\sim$0.37; (2) Further, a spatial analysis of recall scores disclosed that for the near-limb events, the VGG16- and ResNet34-based models exhibited superior prediction sensitivity. The best results, however, were seen with the ResNet34-based model for the near-limb flares, where the average recall was approximately 0.59 (the recall for X- and M-class was 0.81 and 0.56 respectively) and (3) Our research findings demonstrate that our models are capable of discerning complex spatial patterns from full-disk magnetograms and exhibit skill in predicting solar flares, even in the vicinity of near-limb regions. This ability holds substantial importance for operational flare forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>BrainFounder: Towards Brain Foundation Models for Neuroimage Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret and analyze neurological data. This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

      <title>HumanPlus: Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key arguments for building robots that have similar form factors to human beings is that we can leverage the massive human data for training. Yet, doing so has remained challenging in practice due to the complexities in humanoid perception and control, lingering physical gaps between humanoids and humans in morphologies and actuation, and lack of a data pipeline for humanoids to learn autonomous skills from egocentric vision. In this paper, we introduce a full-stack system for humanoids to learn motion and autonomous skills from human data. We first train a low-level policy in simulation via reinforcement learning using existing 40-hour human motion datasets. This policy transfers to the real world and allows humanoid robots to follow human body and hand motion in real time using only a RGB camera, i.e. shadowing. Through shadowing, human operators can teleoperate humanoids to collect whole-body data for learning different tasks in the real world. Using the data collected, we then perform supervised behavior cloning to train skill policies using egocentric vision, allowing humanoids to complete different tasks autonomously by imitating human skills. We demonstrate the system on our customized 33-DoF 180cm humanoid, autonomously completing tasks such as wearing a shoe to stand up and walk, unloading objects from warehouse racks, folding a sweatshirt, rearranging objects, typing, and greeting another robot with 60-100% success rates using up to 40 demonstrations.

      <title>Object-Attribute-Relation Representation based Video Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of multimedia data volume, there is an increasing need for efficient video transmission in applications such as virtual reality and future video streaming services. Semantic communication is emerging as a vital technique for ensuring efficient and reliable transmission in low-bandwidth, high-noise settings. However, most current approaches focus on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) that depends on end-to-end training. These methods often lack an interpretable semantic representation and struggle with adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce the use of object-attribute-relation (OAR) as a semantic framework for videos to facilitate low bit-rate coding and enhance the JSCC process for more effective video transmission. We utilize OAR sequences for both low bit-rate representation and generative video reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate OAR into the image JSCC model to prioritize communication resources for areas more critical to downstream tasks. Our experiments on traffic surveillance video datasets assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of video transmission performance. The empirical findings demonstrate that our OAR-based video coding method not only outperforms H.265 coding at lower bit-rates but also synergizes with JSCC to deliver robust and efficient video transmission.</description>

      <title>A Label is Worth a Thousand Images in Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data $\textit{quality}$ is a crucial factor in the performance of machine learning models, a principle that dataset distillation methods exploit by compressing training datasets into much smaller counterparts that maintain similar downstream performance. Understanding how and why data distillation methods work is vital not only for improving these methods but also for revealing fundamental characteristics of "good" training data. However, a major challenge in achieving this goal is the observation that distillation approaches, which rely on sophisticated but mostly disparate methods to generate synthetic data, have little in common with each other. In this work, we highlight a largely overlooked aspect common to most of these methods: the use of soft (probabilistic) labels. Through a series of ablation experiments, we study the role of soft labels in depth. Our results reveal that the main factor explaining the performance of state-of-the-art distillation methods is not the specific techniques used to generate synthetic data but rather the use of soft labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that not all soft labels are created equal; they must contain $\textit{structured information}$ to be beneficial. We also provide empirical scaling laws that characterize the effectiveness of soft labels as a function of images-per-class in the distilled dataset and establish an empirical Pareto frontier for data-efficient learning. Combined, our findings challenge conventional wisdom in dataset distillation, underscore the importance of soft labels in learning, and suggest new directions for improving distillation methods. Code for all experiments is available at https://github.com/sunnytqin/no-distillation.</description>

      <title>Candidate Pseudolabel Learning: Enhancing Vision-Language Models by Prompt Tuning with Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) with abundant unlabeled data recently has attracted increasing attention. Existing methods that resort to the pseudolabeling strategy would suffer from heavily incorrect hard pseudolabels when VLMs exhibit low zero-shot performance in downstream tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Candidate Pseudolabel Learning method, termed CPL, to fine-tune VLMs with suitable candidate pseudolabels of unlabeled data in downstream tasks. The core of our method lies in the generation strategy of candidate pseudolabels, which progressively generates refined candidate pseudolabels by both intra- and inter-instance label selection, based on a confidence score matrix for all unlabeled data. This strategy can result in better performance in true label inclusion and class-balanced instance selection. In this way, we can directly apply existing loss functions to learn with generated candidate psueudolabels. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code can be found at https://github.com/vanillaer/CPL-ICML2024.</description>

      <title>MDA: An Interpretable Multi-Modal Fusion with Missing Modalities and Intrinsic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial in medical data research, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diseases and improving diagnostic performance by combining diverse modalities. However, multi-modal fusion faces challenges, including capturing interactions between modalities, addressing missing modalities, handling erroneous modal information, and ensuring interpretability. Many existing researchers tend to design different solutions for these problems, often overlooking the commonalities among them. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal fusion framework that achieves adaptive adjustment over the weights of each modality by introducing the Modal-Domain Attention (MDA). It aims to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal information while allowing for the inclusion of missing modalities or intrinsic noise, thereby enhancing the representation of multi-modal data. We provide visualizations of accuracy changes and MDA weights by observing the process of modal fusion, offering a comprehensive analysis of its interpretability. Extensive experiments on various gastrointestinal disease benchmarks, the proposed MDA maintains high accuracy even in the presence of missing modalities and intrinsic noise. One thing worth mentioning is that the visualization of MDA is highly consistent with the conclusions of existing clinical studies on the dependence of different diseases on various modalities. Code and dataset will be made available.</description>

      <title>MINT: a Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset for Foley Audio Content Planning and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foley audio, critical for enhancing the immersive experience in multimedia content, faces significant challenges in the AI-generated content (AIGC) landscape. Despite advancements in AIGC technologies for text and image generation, the foley audio dubbing remains rudimentary due to difficulties in cross-modal scene matching and content correlation. Current text-to-audio technology, which relies on detailed and acoustically relevant textual descriptions, falls short in practical video dubbing applications. Existing datasets like AudioSet, AudioCaps, Clotho, Sound-of-Story, and WavCaps do not fully meet the requirements for real-world foley audio dubbing task. To address this, we introduce the Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset (MINT), designed to enhance mainstream dubbing tasks such as literary story audiobooks dubbing, image/silent video dubbing. Besides, to address the limitations of existing TTA technology in understanding and planning complex prompts, a Foley Audio Content Planning, Generation, and Alignment (CPGA) framework is proposed, which includes a content planning module leveraging large language models for complex multi-modal prompts comprehension. Additionally, the training process is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization based reinforcement learning, significantly improving the alignment and auditory realism of generated foley audio. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly advances the field of foley audio dubbing, providing robust solutions for the challenges of multi-modal dubbing. Even when utilizing the relatively lightweight GPT-2 model, our framework outperforms open-source multimodal large models such as LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL, and Moondream2. The dataset is available at https://github.com/borisfrb/MINT .</description>

      <title>Leveraging Locality to Boost Sample Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the high cost of collecting robotic data in the real world, sample efficiency is a consistently compelling pursuit in robotics. In this paper, we introduce SGRv2, an imitation learning framework that enhances sample efficiency through improved visual and action representations. Central to the design of SGRv2 is the incorporation of a critical inductive bias-action locality, which posits that robot's actions are predominantly influenced by the target object and its interactions with the local environment. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that action locality is essential for boosting sample efficiency. SGRv2 excels in RLBench tasks with keyframe control using merely 5 demonstrations and surpasses the RVT baseline in 23 of 26 tasks. Furthermore, when evaluated on ManiSkill2 and MimicGen using dense control, SGRv2's success rate is 2.54 times that of SGR. In real-world environments, with only eight demonstrations, SGRv2 can perform a variety of tasks at a markedly higher success rate compared to baseline models.

      <title>RoboPoint: A Vision-Language Model for Spatial Affordance Prediction for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From rearranging objects on a table to putting groceries into shelves, robots must plan precise action points to perform tasks accurately and reliably. In spite of the recent adoption of vision language models (VLMs) to control robot behavior, VLMs struggle to precisely articulate robot actions using language. We introduce an automatic synthetic data generation pipeline that instruction-tunes VLMs to robotic domains and needs. Using the pipeline, we train RoboPoint, a VLM that predicts image keypoint affordances given language instructions. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse environments and viewpoints. In addition, RoboPoint is a general model that enables several downstream applications such as robot navigation, manipulation, and augmented reality (AR) assistance. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboPoint outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o) and visual prompting techniques (PIVOT) by 21.8% in the accuracy of predicting spatial affordance and by 30.5% in the success rate of downstream tasks.

      <title>Beyond the Visible: Jointly Attending to Spectral and Spatial Dimensions with HSI-Diffusion for the FINCH Spacecraft</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite remote sensing missions have gained popularity over the past fifteen years due to their ability to cover large swaths of land at regular intervals, making them ideal for monitoring environmental trends. The FINCH mission, a 3U+ CubeSat equipped with a hyperspectral camera, aims to monitor crop residue cover in agricultural fields. Although hyperspectral imaging captures both spectral and spatial information, it is prone to various types of noise, including random noise, stripe noise, and dead pixels. Effective denoising of these images is crucial for downstream scientific tasks. Traditional methods, including hand-crafted techniques encoding strong priors, learned 2D image denoising methods applied across different hyperspectral bands, or diffusion generative models applied independently on bands, often struggle with varying noise strengths across spectral bands, leading to significant spectral distortion. This paper presents a novel approach to hyperspectral image denoising using latent diffusion models that integrate spatial and spectral information. We particularly do so by building a 3D diffusion model and presenting a 3-stage training approach on real and synthetically crafted datasets. The proposed method preserves image structure while reducing noise. Evaluations on both popular hyperspectral denoising datasets and synthetically crafted datasets for the FINCH mission demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are large-scale deep-learning models trained on extensive datasets using self-supervised techniques. These models serve as a base for various downstream tasks, including healthcare. FMs have been adopted with great success across various domains within healthcare, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, graph learning, biology, and omics. Existing healthcare-based surveys have not yet included all of these domains. Therefore, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of FMs in healthcare. We focus on the history, learning strategies, flagship models, applications, and challenges of FMs. We explore how FMs such as the BERT and GPT families are reshaping various healthcare domains, including clinical large language models, medical image analysis, and omics data. Furthermore, we provide a detailed taxonomy of healthcare applications facilitated by FMs, such as clinical NLP, medical computer vision, graph learning, and other biology-related tasks. Despite the promising opportunities FMs provide, they also have several associated challenges, which are explained in detail. We also outline potential future directions to provide researchers and practitioners with insights into the potential and limitations of FMs in healthcare to advance their deployment and mitigate associated risks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Domains, Dynamic Solutions: DPCore for Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) seeks to adapt a source pre-trained model to continually changing, unlabeled target domains. Existing TTA methods are typically designed for environments where domain changes occur gradually and can struggle in more dynamic scenarios. Inspired by the principles of online K-Means, this paper introduces a novel approach to continual TTA through visual prompting. We propose a Dynamic Prompt Coreset that not only preserves knowledge from previously visited domains but also accommodates learning from new potential domains. This is complemented by a distance-based weight updating mechanism that ensures the coreset remains current and relevant. Our approach employs a fixed model architecture alongside the coreset and an innovative updating system to effectively mitigate challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Extensive testing across various benchmarks-including ImageNet-C, CIFAR100-C, and CIFAR10-C-demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) alternatives, particularly excelling in dynamically changing environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) method for image classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Supervision in Asymmetric Non-Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised contrastive representation learning has been shown to be effective in various transfer learning scenarios. However, while asymmetric non-contrastive learning (ANCL) often outperforms its contrastive learning counterpart in self-supervised representation learning, the extension of ANCL to supervised scenarios is less explored. To bridge the gap, we study ANCL for supervised representation learning, coined SupSiam and SupBYOL, leveraging labels in ANCL to achieve better representations. The proposed supervised ANCL framework improves representation learning while avoiding collapse. Our analysis reveals that providing supervision to ANCL reduces intra-class variance, and the contribution of supervision should be adjusted to achieve the best performance. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of supervised ANCL across various datasets and tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/JH-Oh-23/Sup-ANCL.</description>

      <title>Geometric Distortion Guided Transformer for Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As virtual and augmented reality applications gain popularity, omnidirectional image (ODI) super-resolution has become increasingly important. Unlike 2D plain images that are formed on a plane, ODIs are projected onto spherical surfaces. Applying established image super-resolution methods to ODIs, therefore, requires performing equirectangular projection (ERP) to map the ODIs onto a plane. ODI super-resolution needs to take into account geometric distortion resulting from ERP. However, without considering such geometric distortion of ERP images, previous deep-learning-based methods only utilize a limited range of pixels and may easily miss self-similar textures for reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a novel Geometric Distortion Guided Transformer for Omnidirectional image Super-Resolution (GDGT-OSR). Specifically, a distortion modulated rectangle-window self-attention mechanism, integrated with deformable self-attention, is proposed to better perceive the distortion and thus involve more self-similar textures. Distortion modulation is achieved through a newly devised distortion guidance generator that produces guidance by exploiting the variability of distortion across latitudes. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic feature aggregation scheme to adaptively fuse the features from different self-attention modules. We present extensive experimental results on public datasets and show that the new GDGT-OSR outperforms methods in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Development and Validation of Fully Automatic Deep Learning-Based Algorithms for Immunohistochemistry Reporting of Invasive Breast Ductal Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis is a well-accepted and widely used method for molecular subtyping, a procedure for prognosis and targeted therapy of breast carcinoma, the most common type of tumor affecting women. There are four molecular biomarkers namely progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), antigen Ki67, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) whose assessment is needed under IHC procedure to decide prognosis as well as predictors of response to therapy. However, IHC scoring is based on subjective microscopic examination of tumor morphology and suffers from poor reproducibility, high subjectivity, and often incorrect scoring in low-score cases. In this paper, we present, a deep learning-based semi-supervised trained, fully automatic, decision support system (DSS) for IHC scoring of invasive ductal carcinoma. Our system automatically detects the tumor region removing artifacts and scores based on Allred standard. The system is developed using 3 million pathologist-annotated image patches from 300 slides, fifty thousand in-house cell annotations, and forty thousand pixels marking of HER2 membrane. We have conducted multicentric trials at four centers with three different types of digital scanners in terms of percentage agreement with doctors. And achieved agreements of 95, 92, 88 and 82 percent for Ki67, HER2, ER, and PR stain categories, respectively. In addition to overall accuracy, we found that there is 5 percent of cases where pathologist have changed their score in favor of algorithm score while reviewing with detailed algorithmic analysis. Our approach could improve the accuracy of IHC scoring and subsequent therapy decisions, particularly where specialist expertise is unavailable. Our system is highly modular. The proposed algorithm modules can be used to develop DSS for other cancer types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical report we present TrafficBots V1.5, a baseline method for the closed-loop simulation of traffic agents. TrafficBots V1.5 achieves baseline-level performance and a 3rd place ranking in the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) 2024. It is a simple baseline that combines TrafficBots, a CVAE-based multi-agent policy conditioned on each agent's individual destination and personality, and HPTR, the heterogeneous polyline transformer with relative pose encoding. To improve the performance on the WOSAC leaderboard, we apply scheduled teacher-forcing at the training time and we filter the sampled scenarios at the inference time. The code is available at https://github.com/zhejz/TrafficBotsV1.5.</description>

      <title>Generalization and Knowledge Transfer in Abstract Visual Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generalization and knowledge reuse capabilities of deep neural networks in the domain of abstract visual reasoning (AVR), employing Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs), a recognized benchmark task for assessing AVR abilities. Two knowledge transfer scenarios referring to the I-RAVEN dataset are investigated. Firstly, inspired by generalization assessment capabilities of the PGM dataset and popularity of I-RAVEN, we introduce Attributeless-I-RAVEN, a benchmark with four generalization regimes that allow to test generalization of abstract rules applied to held-out attributes. Secondly, we construct I-RAVEN-Mesh, a dataset that enriches RPMs with a novel component structure comprising line-based patterns, facilitating assessment of progressive knowledge acquisition in transfer learning setting. The developed benchmarks reveal shortcomings of the contemporary deep learning models, which we partly address with Pathways of Normalized Group Convolution (PoNG) model, a novel neural architecture for solving AVR tasks. PoNG excels in both presented challenges, as well as the standard I-RAVEN and PGM setups.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Abstract Visual Reasoning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) encompasses a wide range of problems, many of which are inspired by human IQ tests. The variety of AVR tasks has resulted in state-of-the-art AVR methods being task-specific approaches. Furthermore, contemporary methods consider each AVR problem instance not as a whole, but in the form of a set of individual panels with particular locations and roles (context vs. answer panels) pre-assigned according to the task-specific arrangements. While these highly specialized approaches have recently led to significant progress in solving particular AVR tasks, considering each task in isolation hinders the development of universal learning systems in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a unified view of AVR tasks, where each problem instance is rendered as a single image, with no a priori assumptions about the number of panels, their location, or role. The main advantage of the proposed unified view is the ability to develop universal learning models applicable to various AVR tasks. What is more, the proposed approach inherently facilitates transfer learning in the AVR domain, as various types of problems share a common representation. The experiments conducted on four AVR datasets with Raven's Progressive Matrices and Visual Analogy Problems, and one real-world visual analogy dataset show that the proposed unified representation of AVR tasks poses a challenge to state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) AVR models and, more broadly, contemporary DL image recognition methods. In order to address this challenge, we introduce the Unified Model for Abstract Visual Reasoning (UMAVR) capable of dealing with various types of AVR problems in a unified manner. UMAVR outperforms existing AVR methods in selected single-task learning experiments, and demonstrates effective knowledge reuse in transfer learning and curriculum learning setups.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Classes and How to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, coarse-grained labels are readily available compared to fine-grained labels that reflect subtle differences between classes. However, existing methods cannot leverage coarse labels to infer fine-grained labels in an unsupervised manner. To bridge this gap, we propose FALCON, a method that discovers fine-grained classes from coarsely labeled data without any supervision at the fine-grained level. FALCON simultaneously infers unknown fine-grained classes and underlying relationships between coarse and fine-grained classes. Moreover, FALCON is a modular method that can effectively learn from multiple datasets labeled with different strategies. We evaluate FALCON on eight image classification tasks and a single-cell classification task. FALCON outperforms baselines by a large margin, achieving 22% improvement over the best baseline on the tieredImageNet dataset with over 600 fine-grained classes.</description>

      <title>Graspness Discovery in Clutters for Fast and Accurate Grasp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and robust grasp pose detection is vital for robotic manipulation. For general 6 DoF grasping, conventional methods treat all points in a scene equally and usually adopt uniform sampling to select grasp candidates. However, we discover that ignoring where to grasp greatly harms the speed and accuracy of current grasp pose detection methods. In this paper, we propose "graspness", a quality based on geometry cues that distinguishes graspable areas in cluttered scenes. A look-ahead searching method is proposed for measuring the graspness and statistical results justify the rationality of our method. To quickly detect graspness in practice, we develop a neural network named cascaded graspness model to approximate the searching process. Extensive experiments verify the stability, generality and effectiveness of our graspness model, allowing it to be used as a plug-and-play module for different methods. A large improvement in accuracy is witnessed for various previous methods after equipping our graspness model. Moreover, we develop GSNet, an end-to-end network that incorporates our graspness model for early filtering of low-quality predictions. Experiments on a large-scale benchmark, GraspNet-1Billion, show that our method outperforms previous arts by a large margin (30+ AP) and achieves a high inference speed. The library of GSNet has been integrated into AnyGrasp, which is at https://github.com/graspnet/anygrasp_sdk.</description>

      <title>WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models , including GPT4, Claude3, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

      <title>Multimodal Needle in a Haystack: Benchmarking Long-Context Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant promise in various applications, leading to broad interest from researchers and practitioners alike. However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models. All the code, data, and instructions required to reproduce the main results are available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/multimodal-needle-in-a-haystack.</description>

      <title>MFC-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Fact-Checking with Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have significantly improved multimodal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from actual facts due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three tasks: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked 12 diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy artificial intelligence potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.</description>

      <title>GUICourse: From General Vision Language Models to Versatile GUI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Graphic User Interface (GUI) for human-computer interaction is essential for accessing a wide range of digital tools. Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks. However, current VLMs are challenged in terms of fundamental abilities (OCR and grounding) and GUI knowledge (the functions and control methods of GUI elements), preventing them from becoming practical GUI agents. To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks. Finally, we analyze the different varieties in the training stage of this agent by ablation study. Our source codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yiye3/GUICourse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of image deblurring has seen tremendous progress with the rise of deep learning models. These models, albeit efficient, are computationally expensive and energy consuming. Dictionary based learning approaches have shown promising results in image denoising and Single Image Super-Resolution. We propose an extension of the Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution (RAISR) algorithm introduced by Isidoro, Romano and Milanfar for the task of out-of-focus blur removal. We define a sharpness quality measure which aligns well with the perceptual quality of an image. A metric based blending strategy based on asset allocation management is also proposed. Our method demonstrates an average increase of approximately 13% (PSNR) and 10% (SSIM) compared to popular deblurring methods. Furthermore, our blending scheme curtails ringing artefacts post restoration.</description>

      <title>Preserving Knowledge in Large Language Model: A Model-Agnostic Self-Decompression Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can retain old knowledge while learning new information, but Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when post-pretrained or supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on domain-specific data. Moreover, for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which are composed of the LLM base and visual projector (e.g. LLaVA), a significant decline in performance on language benchmarks was observed compared to their single-modality counterparts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model-agnostic self-decompression method, Tree Generation (TG), that decompresses knowledge within LLMs into the training corpus. This paper focuses on TG-SFT, which can synthetically generate SFT data for the instruction tuning steps. By incorporating the dumped corpus during SFT for MLLMs, we significantly reduce the forgetting problem.</description>

      <title>Multi-Camera Hand-Eye Calibration for Human-Robot Collaboration in Industrial Robotic Workcells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial scenarios, effective human-robot collaboration relies on multi-camera systems to robustly monitor human operators despite the occlusions that typically show up in a robotic workcell. In this scenario, precise localization of the person in the robot coordinate system is essential, making the hand-eye calibration of the camera network critical. This process presents significant challenges when high calibration accuracy should be achieved in short time to minimize production downtime, and when dealing with extensive camera networks used for monitoring wide areas, such as industrial robotic workcells. Our paper introduces an innovative and robust multi-camera hand-eye calibration method, designed to optimize each camera's pose relative to both the robot's base and to each other camera. This optimization integrates two types of key constraints: i) a single board-to-end-effector transformation, and ii) the relative camera-to-camera transformations. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method through comprehensive experiments employing the METRIC dataset and real-world data collected on industrial scenarios, showing notable advancements over state-of-the-art techniques even using less than 10 images. Additionally, we release an open-source version of our multi-camera hand-eye calibration algorithm at https://github.com/davidea97/Multi-Camera-Hand-Eye-Calibration.git.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Where It Matters: Constrained Temperature Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider calibration of convolutional classifiers for diagnostic decision making. Clinical decision makers can use calibrated classifiers to minimise expected costs given their own cost function. Such functions are usually unknown at training time. If minimising expected costs is the primary aim, algorithms should focus on tuning calibration in regions of probability simplex likely to effect decisions. We give an example, modifying temperature scaling calibration, and demonstrate improved calibration where it matters using convnets trained to classify dermoscopy images.</description>

      <title>RO-SVD: A Reconfigurable Hardware Copyright Protection Framework for AIGC Applications</title>

Abstract: The dramatic surge in the utilisation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) underscores the need for a secure and efficient mechanism to responsibly manage, use and disseminate multi-dimensional data generated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based copyright traceability framework called ring oscillator-singular value decomposition (RO-SVD), which introduces decomposition computing to approximate low-rank matrices generated from hardware entropy sources and establishes an AI-generated content (AIGC) copyright traceability mechanism at the device level. By leveraging the parallelism and reconfigurability of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), our framework can be easily constructed on existing AI-accelerated devices and provide a low-cost solution to emerging copyright issues of AIGC. We developed a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design prototype based on comprehensive analysis and on-board experiments with multiple AI-applicable FPGAs. Using AI-generated images as a case study, our framework demonstrated effectiveness and emphasised customisation, unpredictability, efficiency, management and reconfigurability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical hardware study discussing and implementing copyright traceability specifically for AI-generated content.</description>

      <title>AIC MLLM: Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects.Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly.However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses. To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities.We carefully design two types of prompt instructions through interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2)textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction.During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts.To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.Real-world demonstration can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and SLAM technology, the performance of autonomous systems using multimodal sensors highly relies on accurate extrinsic calibration. Addressing the need for a convenient, maintenance-friendly calibration process in any natural environment, this paper introduces Galibr, a fully automatic targetless LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration tool designed for ground vehicle platforms in any natural setting. The method utilizes the ground planes and edge information from both LiDAR and camera inputs, streamlining the calibration process. It encompasses two main steps: an initial pose estimation algorithm based on ground planes (GP-init), and a refinement phase through edge extraction and matching. Our approach significantly enhances calibration performance, primarily attributed to our novel initial pose estimation method, as demonstrated in unstructured natural environments, including on the KITTI dataset and the KAIST quadruped dataset.</description>

      <title>Words in Motion: Representation Engineering for Motion Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion forecasting transforms sequences of past movements and environment context into future motion. Recent methods rely on learned representations, resulting in hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we use natural language to quantize motion features in a human-interpretable way, and measure the degree to which they are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal that hidden states of motion sequences are arranged with respect to our discrete sets of motion features. Following these insights, we fit control vectors to motion features, which allow for controlling motion forecasts at inference. Consequently, our method enables controlling transformer-based motion forecasting models with textual inputs, providing a unique interface to interact with and understand these models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Federated Learning from Client Databases with Different Brain Diseases and MRI Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmentation models for brain lesions in MRI are commonly developed for a specific disease and trained on data with a predefined set of MRI modalities. Each such model cannot segment the disease using data with a different set of MRI modalities, nor can it segment any other type of disease. Moreover, this training paradigm does not allow a model to benefit from learning from heterogeneous databases that may contain scans and segmentation labels for different types of brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities. Is it feasible to use Federated Learning (FL) for training a single model on client databases that contain scans and labels of different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities? We demonstrate promising results by combining appropriate, simple, and practical modifications to the model and training strategy: Designing a model with input channels that cover the whole set of modalities available across clients, training with random modality drop, and exploring the effects of feature normalization methods. Evaluation on 7 brain MRI databases with 5 different diseases shows that such FL framework can train a single model that is shown to be very promising in segmenting all disease types seen during training. Importantly, it is able to segment these diseases in new databases that contain sets of modalities different from those in training clients. These results demonstrate, for the first time, feasibility and effectiveness of using FL to train a single segmentation model on decentralised data with diverse brain diseases and MRI modalities, a necessary step towards leveraging heterogeneous real-world databases.

      <title>SeamPose: Repurposing Seams as Capacitive Sensors in a Shirt for Upper-Body Pose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seams are areas of overlapping fabric formed by stitching two or more pieces of fabric together in the cut-and-sew apparel manufacturing process. In SeamPose, we repurposed seams as capacitive sensors in a shirt for continuous upper-body pose estimation. Compared to previous all-textile motion-capturing garments that place the electrodes on the surface of clothing, our solution leverages existing seams inside of a shirt by machine-sewing insulated conductive threads over the seams. The unique invisibilities and placements of the seams afford the sensing shirt to look and wear the same as a conventional shirt while providing exciting pose-tracking capabilities. To validate this approach, we implemented a proof-of-concept untethered shirt. With eight capacitive sensing seams, our customized deep-learning pipeline accurately estimates the upper-body 3D joint positions relative to the pelvis. With a 12-participant user study, we demonstrated promising cross-user and cross-session tracking performance. SeamPose represents a step towards unobtrusive integration of smart clothing for everyday pose estimation.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning To Improve Segmentation With Intraoperative CBCT &amp; Preoperative CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intraoperative medical imaging, particularly Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), is an important tool facilitating computer aided interventions, despite a lower visual quality. While this degraded image quality can affect downstream segmentation, the availability of high quality preoperative scans represents potential for improvements. Here we consider a setting where preoperative CT and intraoperative CBCT scans are available, however, the alignment (registration) between the scans is imperfect. We propose a multimodal learning method that fuses roughly aligned CBCT and CT scans and investigate the effect of CBCT quality and misalignment (affine and elastic transformations facilitating misalignment) on the final segmentation performance. As an application scenario, we focus on the segmentation of liver and liver tumor semantic segmentation and evaluate the effect of intraoperative image quality and misalignment on segmentation performance. To accomplish this, high quality, labelled CTs are defined as preoperative and used as a basis to simulate intraoperative CBCT. We show that the fusion of preoperative CT and simulated, intraoperative CBCT mostly improves segmentation performance and that even clearly misaligned preoperative data has the potential to improve segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder for Accurate Tumor Segmentation in Data-Scarce Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has gained significant attention in medical image segmentation. However, the limited availability of annotated training data presents a challenge to achieving accurate results. In efforts to overcome this challenge, data augmentation techniques have been proposed. However, the majority of these approaches primarily focus on image generation. For segmentation tasks, providing both images and their corresponding target masks is crucial, and the generation of diverse and realistic samples remains a complex task, especially when working with limited training datasets. To this end, we propose a new end-to-end hybrid architecture based on Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoders (HVAE) and a discriminative regularization to improve the quality of generated images. Our method provides an accuracte estimation of the joint distribution of the images and masks, resulting in the generation of realistic medical images with reduced artifacts and off-distribution instances. As generating 3D volumes requires substantial time and memory, our architecture operates on a slice-by-slice basis to segment 3D volumes, capitilizing on the richly augmented dataset. Experiments conducted on two public datasets, BRATS (MRI modality) and HECKTOR (PET modality), demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method on different medical imaging modalities with limited data.</description>

      <title>See It from My Perspective: Diagnosing the Western Cultural Bias of Large Vision-Language Models in Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can respond to queries about images in many languages. However, beyond language, culture affects how we see things. For example, individuals from Western cultures focus more on the central figure in an image while individuals from Eastern cultures attend more to scene context. In this work, we present a novel investigation that demonstrates and localizes VLMs' Western bias in image understanding. We evaluate large VLMs across subjective and objective visual tasks with culturally diverse images and annotations. We find that VLMs perform better on the Western subset than the Eastern subset of each task. Controlled experimentation tracing the source of this bias highlights the importance of a diverse language mix in text-only pre-training for building equitable VLMs, even when inference is performed in English. Moreover, while prompting in the language of a target culture can lead to reductions in bias, it is not a substitute for building AI more representative of the world's languages.</description>

      <title>A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities.
  Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Robotic grasping presents a difficult motor task in real-world scenarios, constituting a major hurdle to the deployment of capable robots across various industries. Notably, the scarcity of data makes grasping particularly challenging for learned models. Recent advancements in computer vision have witnessed a growth of successful unsupervised training mechanisms predicated on massive amounts of data sourced from the Internet, and now nearly all prominent models leverage pretrained backbone networks. Against this backdrop, we begin to investigate the potential benefits of large-scale visual pretraining in enhancing robot grasping performance. This preliminary literature review sheds light on critical challenges and delineates prospective directions for future research in visual pretraining for robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning for Unpaired H&amp;E-to-IHC Stain Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H&amp;E-to-IHC stain translation techniques offer a promising solution for precise cancer diagnosis, especially in low-resource regions where there is a shortage of health professionals and limited access to expensive equipment. Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&amp;E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&amp;E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&amp;E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, instruction-tuned Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been successful at several tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering; yet leveraging these models remains an open question for robotics. Prior LMMs for robotics applications have been extensively trained on language and action data, but their ability to generalize in different settings has often been less than desired. To address this, we introduce LLARVA, a model trained with a novel instruction tuning method that leverages structured prompts to unify a range of robotic learning tasks, scenarios, and environments. Additionally, we show that predicting intermediate 2-D representations, which we refer to as "visual traces", can help further align vision and action spaces for robot learning. We generate 8.5M image-visual trace pairs from the Open X-Embodiment dataset in order to pre-train our model, and we evaluate on 12 different tasks in the RLBench simulator as well as a physical Franka Emika Panda 7-DoF robot. Our experiments yield strong performance, demonstrating that LLARVA - using 2-D and language representations - performs well compared to several contemporary baselines, and can generalize across various robot environments and configurations.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive Attention Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.10529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across multiple datasets is a challenging task due to two main reasons: the presence of large cross-dataset distinctions and the absence of annotated target instances. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a domain adaptive attention learning approach to reliably transfer discriminative representation from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. In this approach, a domain adaptive attention model is learned to separate the feature map into domain-shared part and domain-specific part. In this manner, the domain-shared part is used to capture transferable cues that can compensate cross-dataset distinctions and give positive contributions to the target task, while the domain-specific part aims to model the noisy information to avoid the negative transfer caused by domain diversity. A soft label loss is further employed to take full use of unlabeled target data by estimating pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Joint stereo 3D object detection and implicit surface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new learning-based framework S-3D-RCNN that can recover accurate object orientation in SO(3) and simultaneously predict implicit rigid shapes from stereo RGB images. For orientation estimation, in contrast to previous studies that map local appearance to observation angles, we propose a progressive approach by extracting meaningful Intermediate Geometrical Representations (IGRs). This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities from one or two views to object part coordinates to achieve direct egocentric object orientation estimation in the camera coordinate system. To further achieve finer description inside 3D bounding boxes, we investigate the implicit shape estimation problem from stereo images. We model visible object surfaces by designing a point-based representation, augmenting IGRs to explicitly address the unseen surface hallucination problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed IGRs, and S-3D-RCNN achieves superior 3D scene understanding performance. We also designed new metrics on the KITTI benchmark for our evaluation of implicit shape estimation.</description>

      <title>PointSCNet: Point Cloud Structure and Correlation Learning Based on Space Filling Curve-Guided Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical structures and the internal local region relationship, such as symmetry, regular array, junction, etc., are essential for understanding a 3D shape. This paper proposes a point cloud feature extraction network named PointSCNet, to capture the geometrical structure information and local region correlation information of a point cloud. The PointSCNet consists of three main modules: the space-filling curve-guided sampling module, the information fusion module, and the channel-spatial attention module. The space-filling curve-guided sampling module uses Z-order curve coding to sample points that contain geometrical correlation. The information fusion module uses a correlation tensor and a set of skip connections to fuse the structure and correlation information. The channel-spatial attention module enhances the representation of key points and crucial feature channels to refine the network. The proposed PointSCNet is evaluated on shape classification and part segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the PointSCNet outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods by learning the structure and correlation of point clouds effectively.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalisation for Object Detection under Covariate and Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05294v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalisation aims to promote the learning of domain-invariant features while suppressing domain-specific features, so that a model can generalise better to previously unseen target domains. An approach to domain generalisation for object detection is proposed, the first such approach applicable to any object detection architecture. Based on a rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend approaches based on feature alignment with a novel component for performing class conditional alignment at the instance level, in addition to aligning the marginal feature distributions across domains at the image level. This allows us to fully address both components of domain shift, i.e. covariate and concept shift, and learn a domain agnostic feature representation. We perform extensive evaluation with both one-stage (FCOS, YOLO) and two-stage (FRCNN) detectors, on a newly proposed benchmark comprising several different datasets for autonomous driving applications (Cityscapes, BDD10K, ACDC, IDD) as well as the GWHD dataset for precision agriculture, and show consistent improvements to the generalisation and localisation performance over baselines and state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Domain Camera Adaptation and Collaborative Multiple Feature Clustering for Unsupervised Person Re-ID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn much attention due to its open-world scenario settings where limited annotated data is available. Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on unseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity information and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we aim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from two aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source domain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain. Besides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate the influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network is utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain. Moreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel collaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the internal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial feature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised clustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature branch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the competitive performance of our method under unsupervised person re-ID settings.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Framework for Topology-Preserving Segmentation using Quasiconformal Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Topology-Preserving Segmentation Network, a deformation-based model that can extract objects in an image while maintaining their topological properties. This network generates segmentation masks that have the same topology as the template mask, even when trained with limited data. The network consists of two components: the Deformation Estimation Network, which produces a deformation map that warps the template mask to enclose the region of interest, and the Beltrami Adjustment Module, which ensures the bijectivity of the deformation map by truncating the associated Beltrami coefficient based on Quasiconformal theories. The proposed network can also be trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled training data. This is achieved by incorporating an unsupervised segmentation loss. Our experimental results on various image datasets show that TPSN achieves better segmentation accuracy than state-of-the-art models with correct topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate TPSN's ability to handle multiple object segmentation.</description>

      <title>SeaFormer++: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13156v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone. Our code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/fudan-zvg/SeaFormer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KBody is a method for fitting a low-dimensional body model to an image. It follows a predict-and-optimize approach, relying on data-driven model estimates for the constraints that will be used to solve for the body's parameters. Acknowledging the importance of high quality correspondences, it leverages ``virtual joints" to improve fitting performance, disentangles the optimization between the pose and shape parameters, and integrates asymmetric distance fields to strike a balance in terms of pose and shape capturing capacity, as well as pixel alignment. We also show that generative model inversion offers a strong appearance prior that can be used to complete partial human images and used as a building block for generalized and robust monocular body fitting.

      <title>PiClick: Picking the desired mask from multiple candidates in click-based interactive segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-based interactive segmentation aims to generate target masks via human clicking, which facilitates efficient pixel-level annotation and image editing. In such a task, target ambiguity remains a problem hindering the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation. That is, in scenes with rich context, one click may correspond to multiple potential targets, while most previous interactive segmentors only generate a single mask and fail to deal with target ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive segmentation network named PiClick, to yield all potentially reasonable masks and suggest the most plausible one for the user. Specifically, PiClick utilizes a Transformer-based architecture to generate all potential target masks by mutually interactive mask queries. Moreover, a Target Reasoning module(TRM) is designed in PiClick to automatically suggest the user-desired mask from all candidates, relieving target ambiguity and extra-human efforts. Extensive experiments on 9 interactive segmentation datasets demonstrate PiClick performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts considering the segmentation results. Moreover, we show that PiClick effectively reduces human efforts in annotating and picking the desired masks. To ease the usage and inspire future research, we release the source code of PiClick together with a plug-and-play annotation tool at https://github.com/cilinyan/PiClick.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instance segmentation of point clouds is a crucial task in 3D field with numerous applications that involve localizing and segmenting objects in a scene. However, achieving satisfactory results requires a large number of manual annotations, which is a time-consuming and expensive process. To alleviate dependency on annotations, we propose a novel framework, FreePoint, for underexplored unsupervised class-agnostic instance segmentation on point clouds. In detail, we represent the point features by combining coordinates, colors, and self-supervised deep features. Based on the point features, we perform a bottom-up multicut algorithm to segment point clouds into coarse instance masks as pseudo labels, which are used to train a point cloud instance segmentation model. We propose an id-as-feature strategy at this stage to alleviate the randomness of the multicut algorithm and improve the pseudo labels' quality. During training, we propose a weakly-supervised two-step training strategy and corresponding losses to overcome the inaccuracy of coarse masks. FreePoint has achieved breakthroughs in unsupervised class-agnostic instance segmentation on point clouds and outperformed previous traditional methods by over 18.2% and a competitive concurrent work UnScene3D by 5.5% in AP. Additionally, when used as a pretext task and fine-tuned on S3DIS, FreePoint performs significantly better than existing self-supervised pre-training methods with limited annotations and surpasses CSC by 6.0% in AP with 10% annotation masks.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Label-Efficient Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, deep neural networks have achieved significant progress in point cloud learning. However, collecting large-scale precisely-annotated training data is extremely laborious and expensive, which hinders the scalability of existing point cloud datasets and poses a bottleneck for efficient exploration of point cloud data in various tasks and applications. Label-efficient learning offers a promising solution by enabling effective deep network training with much-reduced annotation efforts. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of label-efficient learning of point clouds. We address three critical questions in this emerging research field: i) the importance and urgency of label-efficient learning in point cloud processing, ii) the subfields it encompasses, and iii) the progress achieved in this area. To achieve this, we propose a taxonomy that organizes label-efficient learning methods based on the data prerequisites provided by different types of labels. We categorize four typical label-efficient learning approaches that significantly reduce point cloud annotation efforts: data augmentation, domain transfer learning, weakly-supervised learning, and pretrained foundation models. For each approach, we outline the problem setup and provide an extensive literature review that showcases relevant progress and challenges. Finally, we share insights into current research challenges and potential future directions. A project associated with this survey has been built at https://github.com/xiaoaoran/3D_label_efficient_learning.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Generative Model for Interpretable Subject-level Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest in methods for predicting an unknown variable of interest, such as a subject's diagnosis, from medical images depicting its anatomical-functional effects. Methods based on discriminative modeling excel at making accurate predictions, but are challenged in their ability to explain their decisions in anatomically meaningful terms. In this paper, we propose a simple technique for single-subject prediction that is inherently interpretable. It augments the generative models used in classical human brain mapping techniques, in which the underlying cause-effect relations can be encoded, with a multivariate noise model that captures dominant spatial correlations. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting model can be efficiently inverted to make accurate subject-level predictions, while at the same time offering intuitive visual explanations of its inner workings. The method is easy to use: training is fast for typical training set sizes, and only a single hyperparameter needs to be set by the user. Our code is available at https://github.com/chiara-mauri/Interpretable-subject-level-prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving applications, accurate and efficient road surface reconstruction is paramount. This paper introduces RoMe, a novel framework designed for the robust reconstruction of large-scale road surfaces. Leveraging a unique mesh representation, RoMe ensures that the reconstructed road surfaces are accurate and seamlessly aligned with semantics. To address challenges in computational efficiency, we propose a waypoint sampling strategy, enabling RoMe to reconstruct vast environments by focusing on sub-areas and subsequently merging them. Furthermore, we incorporate an extrinsic optimization module to enhance the robustness against inaccuracies in extrinsic calibration. Our extensive evaluations of both public datasets and wild data underscore RoMe's superiority in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness. For instance, it costs only 2 GPU hours to recover a road surface of 600*600 square meters from thousands of images. Notably, RoMe's capability extends beyond mere reconstruction, offering significant value for autolabeling tasks in autonomous driving applications. All related data and code are available at https://github.com/DRosemei/RoMe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abdominal wall defects often lead to pain, discomfort, and recurrence of incisional hernias, resulting in significant morbidity and repeated surgical repairs worldwide. Mesh repair for large hernias is usually based on the defect area with a fixed overlap, neglecting biomechanical factors such as muscle activation, intra-abdominal pressure, tissue elasticity, and abdominal wall distension. To address this issue, we present a biomechanical approach to incisional hernia repair that takes into account the unstable abdominal wall. Additionally, we introduce HEDI, a tool that uses computed tomography with Valsalva maneuver to automatically detect and assess hernia size, volume, and abdominal wall instability. Our first clinical application of HEDI in the preoperative evaluation of 31 patients shows significantly improved success rates compared to reported rates, with all patients remaining pain-free and experiencing no hernia recurrence after three years of follow-up.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous driving on water surfaces plays an essential role in executing hazardous and time-consuming missions, such as maritime surveillance, survivors rescue, environmental monitoring, hydrography mapping and waste cleaning. This work presents WaterScenes, the first multi-task 4D radar-camera fusion dataset for autonomous driving on water surfaces. Equipped with a 4D radar and a monocular camera, our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) proffers all-weather solutions for discerning object-related information, including color, shape, texture, range, velocity, azimuth, and elevation. Focusing on typical static and dynamic objects on water surfaces, we label the camera images and radar point clouds at pixel-level and point-level, respectively. In addition to basic perception tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, we also provide annotations for free-space segmentation and waterline segmentation. Leveraging the multi-task and multi-modal data, we conduct benchmark experiments on the uni-modality of radar and camera, as well as the fused modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that 4D radar-camera fusion can considerably improve the accuracy and robustness of perception on water surfaces, especially in adverse lighting and weather conditions. WaterScenes dataset is public on https://waterscenes.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, novel view synthesis has gained popularity in generating high-fidelity images. While demonstrating superior performance in the task of synthesizing novel views, the majority of these methods are still based on the conventional multi-layer perceptron for scene embedding. Furthermore, light field models suffer from geometric blurring during pixel rendering, while radiance field-based volume rendering methods have multiple solutions for a certain target of density distribution integration. To address these issues, we introduce the Convolutional Neural Radiance Fields to model the derivatives of radiance along rays. Based on 1D convolutional operations, our proposed method effectively extracts potential ray representations through a structured neural network architecture. Besides, with the proposed ray modeling, a proposed recurrent module is employed to solve geometric ambiguity in the fully neural rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising results of our proposed model compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms benefit from accurate product understanding to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. Traditional methods often focus on isolated tasks such as attribute extraction or categorization, posing adaptability issues to evolving tasks and leading to usability challenges with noisy data from the internet. Current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) lack domain-specific fine-tuning, thus falling short in precision and instruction following. To address these issues, we introduce PumGPT, the first e-commerce specialized LVLM designed for multi-modal product understanding tasks. We collected and curated a dataset of over one million products from AliExpress, filtering out non-inferable attributes using a universal hallucination detection framework, resulting in 663k high-quality data samples. PumGPT focuses on five essential tasks aimed at enhancing workflows for e-commerce platforms and retailers. We also introduce PumBench, a benchmark to evaluate product understanding across LVLMs. Our experiments show that PumGPT outperforms five other open-source LVLMs and GPT-4V in product understanding tasks. We also conduct extensive analytical experiments to delve deeply into the superiority of PumGPT, demonstrating the necessity for a specialized model in the e-commerce domain.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast-and-Ultralight ConvNet-Based Intelligent Monitoring System for Diagnosing Early-Stage Mpox Anytime and Anywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13492</link>

Abstract: Due to the absence of more efficient diagnostic tools, the spread of mpox continues to be unchecked. Although related studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of deep learning models in diagnosing mpox, key aspects such as model inference speed and parameter size have always been overlooked. Herein, an ultrafast and ultralight network named Fast-MpoxNet is proposed. Fast-MpoxNet, with only 0.27M parameters, can process input images at 68 frames per second (FPS) on the CPU. To detect subtle image differences and optimize model parameters better, Fast-MpoxNet incorporates an attention-based feature fusion module and a multiple auxiliary losses enhancement strategy. Experimental results indicate that Fast-MpoxNet, utilizing transfer learning and data augmentation, produces 98.40% classification accuracy for four classes on the mpox dataset. Furthermore, its Recall for early-stage mpox is 93.65%. Most importantly, an application system named Mpox-AISM V2 is developed, suitable for both personal computers and smartphones. Mpox-AISM V2 can rapidly and accurately diagnose mpox and can be easily deployed in various scenarios to offer the public real-time mpox diagnosis services. This work has the potential to mitigate future mpox outbreaks and pave the way for developing real-time diagnostic tools in the healthcare field.</description>

      <title>Attention-Guided Lidar Segmentation and Odometry Using Image-to-Point Cloud Saliency Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR odometry estimation and 3D semantic segmentation are crucial for autonomous driving, which has achieved remarkable advances recently. However, these tasks are challenging due to the imbalance of points in different semantic categories for 3D semantic segmentation and the influence of dynamic objects for LiDAR odometry estimation, which increases the importance of using representative/salient landmarks as reference points for robust feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose a saliency-guided approach that leverages attention information to improve the performance of LiDAR odometry estimation and semantic segmentation models. Unlike in the image domain, only a few studies have addressed point cloud saliency information due to the lack of annotated training data. To alleviate this, we first present a universal framework to transfer saliency distribution knowledge from color images to point clouds, and use this to construct a pseudo-saliency dataset (i.e. FordSaliency) for point clouds. Then, we adopt point cloud-based backbones to learn saliency distribution from pseudo-saliency labels, which is followed by our proposed SalLiDAR module. SalLiDAR is a saliency-guided 3D semantic segmentation model that integrates saliency information to improve segmentation performance. Finally, we introduce SalLONet, a self-supervised saliency-guided LiDAR odometry network that uses the semantic and saliency predictions of SalLiDAR to achieve better odometry estimation. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SalLiDAR and SalLONet models achieve state-of-the-art performance against existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of image-to-LiDAR saliency knowledge transfer. Source code will be available at https://github.com/nevrez/SalLONet.</description>

      <title>To Generate or Not? Safety-Driven Unlearned Diffusion Models Are Still Easy To Generate Unsafe Images ... For Now</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized the generation of realistic and complex images. However, these models also introduce potential safety hazards, such as producing harmful content and infringing data copyrights. Despite the development of safety-driven unlearning techniques to counteract these challenges, doubts about their efficacy persist. To tackle this issue, we introduce an evaluation framework that leverages adversarial prompts to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-driven DMs after they have undergone the process of unlearning harmful concepts. Specifically, we investigated the adversarial robustness of DMs, assessed by adversarial prompts, when eliminating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects. We develop an effective and efficient adversarial prompt generation approach for DMs, termed UnlearnDiffAtk. This method capitalizes on the intrinsic classification abilities of DMs to simplify the creation of adversarial prompts, thereby eliminating the need for auxiliary classification or diffusion models.Through extensive benchmarking, we evaluate the robustness of five widely-used safety-driven unlearned DMs (i.e., DMs after unlearning undesirable concepts, styles, or objects) across a variety of tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency merits of UnlearnDiffAtk over the state-of-the-art adversarial prompt generation method and reveal the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques when applied to DMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Diffusion-MU-Attack.

      <title>Siamese-DETR for Generic Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to detect and track the dynamic objects in different scenes is fundamental to real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Emotional Theory of Mind: Bridging Fast Visual Processing with Slow Linguistic Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emotional theory of mind problem requires facial expressions, body pose, contextual information and implicit commonsense knowledge to reason about the person's emotion and its causes, making it currently one of the most difficult problems in affective computing. In this work, we propose multiple methods to incorporate the emotional reasoning capabilities by constructing "narrative captions" relevant to emotion perception, that includes contextual and physical signal descriptors that focuses on "Who", "What", "Where" and "How" questions related to the image and emotions of the individual. We propose two distinct ways to construct these captions using zero-shot classifiers (CLIP) and fine-tuning visual-language models (LLaVA) over human generated descriptors. We further utilize these captions to guide the reasoning of language (GPT-4) and vision-language models (LLaVa, GPT-Vision). We evaluate the use of the resulting models in an image-to-language-to-emotion task. Our experiments showed that combining the "Fast" narrative descriptors and "Slow" reasoning of language models is a promising way to achieve emotional theory of mind.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle refers to a vehicle capable of perceiving its surrounding environment and driving with little or no human driver input. The perception system is a fundamental component which enables the autonomous vehicle to collect data and extract relevant information from the environment to drive safely. Benefit from the recent advances in computer vision, the perception task can be achieved by using sensors, such as camera, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensor. This paper reviews publications on computer vision and autonomous driving that are published during the last ten years. In particular, we first investigate the development of autonomous driving systems and summarize these systems that are developed by the major automotive manufacturers from different countries. Second, we investigate the sensors and benchmark data sets that are commonly utilized for autonomous driving. Then, a comprehensive overview of computer vision applications for autonomous driving such as depth estimation, object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition are discussed. Additionally, we review public opinions and concerns on autonomous vehicles. Based on the discussion, we analyze the current technological challenges that autonomous vehicles meet with. Finally, we present our insights and point out some promising directions for future research. This paper will help the reader to understand autonomous vehicles from the perspectives of academia and industry.</description>

      <title>InterControl: Zero-shot Human Interaction Generation by Controlling Every Joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-conditioned motion synthesis has made remarkable progress with the emergence of diffusion models. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for a single character and overlook multi-human interactions. In our approach, we strive to explore this problem by synthesizing human motion with interactions for a group of characters of any size in a zero-shot manner. The key aspect of our approach is the adaptation of human-wise interactions as pairs of human joints that can be either in contact or separated by a desired distance. In contrast to existing methods that necessitate training motion generation models on multi-human motion datasets with a fixed number of characters, our approach inherently possesses the flexibility to model human interactions involving an arbitrary number of individuals, thereby transcending the limitations imposed by the training data. We introduce a novel controllable motion generation method, InterControl, to encourage the synthesized motions maintaining the desired distance between joint pairs. It consists of a motion controller and an inverse kinematics guidance module that realistically and accurately aligns the joints of synthesized characters to the desired location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distance between joint pairs for human-wise interactions can be generated using an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM). Experimental results highlight the capability of our framework to generate interactions with multiple human characters and its potential to work with off-the-shelf physics-based character simulators.</description>

      <title>Emergent Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from Off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which prove effective for tasks like visual question answering. However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K). Our codebase is at https://github.com/letitiabanana/PnP-OVSS.</description>

      <title>Leveraging VLM-Based Pipelines to Annotate 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained vision language models (VLMs) present an opportunity to caption unlabeled 3D objects at scale. The leading approach to summarize VLM descriptions from different views of an object (Luo et al., 2023) relies on a language model (GPT4) to produce the final output. This text-based aggregation is susceptible to hallucinations as it merges potentially contradictory descriptions. We propose an alternative algorithm to marginalize over factors such as the viewpoint that affect the VLM's response. Instead of merging text-only responses, we utilize the VLM's joint image-text likelihoods. We show our probabilistic aggregation is not only more reliable and efficient, but sets the SoTA on inferring object types with respect to human-verified labels. The aggregated annotations are also useful for conditional inference; they improve downstream predictions (e.g., of object material) when the object's type is specified as an auxiliary text-based input. Such auxiliary inputs allow ablating the contribution of visual reasoning over visionless reasoning in an unsupervised setting. With these supervised and unsupervised evaluations, we show how a VLM-based pipeline can be leveraged to produce reliable annotations for 764K objects from the Objaverse dataset.</description>

      <title>FSGS: Real-Time Few-shot View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis from limited observations remains an important and persistent task. However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

      <title>A Picture is Worth More Than 77 Text Tokens: Evaluating CLIP-Style Models on Dense Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curation methods for massive vision-language datasets trade off between dataset size and quality. However, even the highest quality of available curated captions are far too short to capture the rich visual detail in an image. To show the value of dense and highly-aligned image-text pairs, we collect the Densely Captioned Images (DCI) dataset, containing 7805 natural images human-annotated with mask-aligned descriptions averaging above 1000 words each. With precise and reliable captions associated with specific parts of an image, we can evaluate vision-language models' (VLMs) understanding of image content with a novel task that matches each caption with its corresponding subcrop. As current models are often limited to 77 text tokens, we also introduce a summarized version (sDCI) in which each caption length is limited. We show that modern techniques that make progress on standard benchmarks do not correspond with significant improvement on our sDCI based benchmark. Lastly, we finetune CLIP using sDCI and show significant improvements over the baseline despite a small training set. By releasing the first human annotated dense image captioning dataset, we hope to enable the development of new benchmarks or fine-tuning recipes for the next generation of VLMs to come.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a generalist radiology diagnosis system can greatly enhance clinical diagnostics. In this paper, we introduce RadDiag, a foundational model supporting 2D and 3D inputs across various modalities and anatomies, using a transformer-based fusion module for comprehensive disease diagnosis. Due to patient privacy concerns and the lack of large-scale radiology diagnosis datasets, we utilize high-quality, clinician-reviewed radiological images available online with diagnosis labels. Our dataset, RP3D-DiagDS, contains 40,936 cases with 195,010 scans covering 5,568 disorders (930 unique ICD-10-CM codes). Experimentally, our RadDiag achieves 95.14% AUC on internal evaluation with the knowledge-enhancement strategy. Additionally, RadDiag can be zero-shot applied or fine-tuned to external diagnosis datasets sourced from various hospitals, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In conclusion, we show that publicly shared medical data on the Internet is a tremendous and valuable resource that can potentially support building a generalist AI for healthcare.</description>

      <title>GenAI Mirage: The Impostor Bias and the Deepfake Detection Challenge in the Era of Artificial Illusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making in forensics and digital forensics, exploring biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and hindsight bias. It assesses existing methods to mitigate biases and improve decision-making, introducing the novel "Impostor Bias", which arises as a systematic tendency to question the authenticity of multimedia content, such as audio, images, and videos, often assuming they are generated by AI tools. This bias goes beyond evaluators' knowledge levels, as it can lead to erroneous judgments and false accusations, undermining the reliability and credibility of forensic evidence. Impostor Bias stems from an a priori assumption rather than an objective content assessment, and its impact is expected to grow with the increasing realism of AI-generated multimedia products. The paper discusses the potential causes and consequences of Impostor Bias, suggesting strategies for prevention and counteraction. By addressing these topics, this paper aims to provide valuable insights, enhance the objectivity and validity of forensic investigations, and offer recommendations for future research and practical applications to ensure the integrity and reliability of forensic practices.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation Framework, Dataset, and Efficient Deep Model for Pedestrian Intention Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is crucial for autonomous driving. In particular, knowing if pedestrians are going to cross in front of the ego-vehicle is core to performing safe and comfortable maneuvers. Creating accurate and fast models that predict such intentions from sequential images is challenging. A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diverse crossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios. We address this scarceness by introducing a framework, named ARCANE, which allows programmatically generating synthetic datasets consisting of C/NC video clip samples. As an example, we use ARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show how PedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, so enabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction. Considering the onboard deployment of C/NC prediction models, we also propose a deep model named PedGNN, which is fast and has a very low memory footprint. PedGNN is based on a GNN-GRU architecture that takes a sequence of pedestrian skeletons as input to predict crossing intentions.</description>

      <title>Fast graph-based denoising for point cloud color information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point clouds are utilized in various 3D applications such as cross-reality (XR) and realistic 3D displays. In some applications, e.g., for live streaming using a 3D point cloud, real-time point cloud denoising methods are required to enhance the visual quality. However, conventional high-precision denoising methods cannot be executed in real time for large-scale point clouds owing to the complexity of graph constructions with K nearest neighbors and noise level estimation. This paper proposes a fast graph-based denoising (FGBD) for a large-scale point cloud. First, high-speed graph construction is achieved by scanning a point cloud in various directions and searching adjacent neighborhoods on the scanning lines. Second, we propose a fast noise level estimation method using eigenvalues of the covariance matrix on a graph. Finally, we also propose a new low-cost filter selection method to enhance denoising accuracy to compensate for the degradation caused by the acceleration algorithms. In our experiments, we succeeded in reducing the processing time dramatically while maintaining accuracy relative to conventional denoising methods. Denoising was performed at 30fps, with frames containing approximately 1 million points.</description>

      <title>ConTextual: Evaluating Context-Sensitive Text-Rich Visual Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks require an agent to reason jointly over text and visual objects, (e.g., navigating in public spaces), which we refer to as context-sensitive text-rich visual reasoning. Specifically, these tasks require an understanding of the context in which the text interacts with visual elements within an image. However, there is a lack of existing datasets to benchmark the state-of-the-art multimodal models' capability on context-sensitive text-rich visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce ConTextual, a novel dataset featuring human-crafted instructions that require context-sensitive reasoning for text-rich images. We conduct experiments to assess the performance of 14 foundation models (GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision, LLaVA-Next) and establish a human performance baseline. Further, we perform human evaluations of the model responses and observe a significant performance gap of 30.8% between GPT-4V (the current best-performing Large Multimodal Model) and human performance. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that GPT-4V encounters difficulties interpreting time-related data and infographics. However, it demonstrates proficiency in comprehending abstract visual contexts such as memes and quotes. Finally, our qualitative analysis uncovers various factors contributing to poor performance including lack of precise visual perception and hallucinations. Our dataset, code, and leaderboard can be found on the project page https://con-textual.github.io/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Apparel's significant role in human appearance underscores the importance of garment digitalization for digital human creation. Recent advances in 3D content creation are pivotal for digital human creation. Nonetheless, garment generation from text guidance is still nascent. We introduce a text-driven 3D garment generation framework, DressCode, which aims to democratize design for novices and offer immense potential in fashion design, virtual try-on, and digital human creation. We first introduce SewingGPT, a GPT-based architecture integrating cross-attention with text-conditioned embedding to generate sewing patterns with text guidance. We then tailor a pre-trained Stable Diffusion to generate tile-based Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures for the garments. By leveraging a large language model, our framework generates CG-friendly garments through natural language interaction. It also facilitates pattern completion and texture editing, streamlining the design process through user-friendly interaction. This framework fosters innovation by allowing creators to freely experiment with designs and incorporate unique elements into their work. With comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, our method showcases superior quality and alignment with input prompts. User studies further validate our high-quality rendering results, highlighting its practical utility and potential in production settings.

      <title>Tuning Large Multimodal Models for Videos using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have influenced the development of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). The previous approaches for VLMMs involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction-tuned datasets, integrating LLM with visual encoders, and adding additional learnable modules. Video and text multimodal alignment remains challenging, primarily due to the deficient volume and quality of multimodal instruction-tune data compared to text-only data. We present a novel alignment strategy that employs multimodal AI system to oversee itself called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), providing self-preference feedback to refine itself and facilitating the alignment of video and text modalities. In specific, we propose context-aware reward modeling by providing detailed video descriptions as context during the generation of preference feedback in order to enrich the understanding of video content. Demonstrating enhanced performance across diverse video benchmarks, our multimodal RLAIF approach, VLM-RLAIF, outperforms existing approaches, including the SFT model. We commit to open-sourcing our code, models, and datasets to foster further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Pretraining Vision-Language Model for Difference Visual Question Answering in Longitudinal Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair of images. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder that tackles diverse video understanding tasks with a single frozen model. We pretrain VideoPrism on a heterogeneous corpus containing 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M video clips with noisy parallel text (e.g., ASR transcripts). The pretraining approach improves upon masked autoencoding by global-local distillation of semantic video embeddings and a token shuffling scheme, enabling VideoPrism to focus primarily on the video modality while leveraging the invaluable text associated with videos. We extensively test VideoPrism on four broad groups of video understanding tasks, from web video question answering to CV for science, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 31 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework and Dataset for Assessing Societal Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained widespread adoption in both industry and academia. In this study, we propose a unified framework for systematically evaluating gender, race, and age biases in VLMs with respect to professions. Our evaluation encompasses all supported inference modes of the recent VLMs, including image-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image. Additionally, we propose an automated pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic datasets that intentionally conceal gender, race, and age information across different professional domains, both in generated text and images. The dataset includes action-based descriptions of each profession and serves as a benchmark for evaluating societal biases in vision-language models (VLMs). In our comparative analysis of widely used VLMs, we have identified that varying input-output modalities lead to discernible differences in bias magnitudes and directions. Additionally, we find that VLM models exhibit distinct biases across different bias attributes we investigated. We hope our work will help guide future progress in improving VLMs to learn socially unbiased representations. We will release our data and code.</description>

      <title>Visual Hallucinations of Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual hallucination (VH) means that a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) imagines incorrect details about an image in visual question answering. Existing studies find VH instances only in existing image datasets, which results in biased understanding of MLLMs' performance under VH due to limited diversity of such VH instances. In this work, we propose a tool called VHTest to generate a diverse set of VH instances. Specifically, VHTest finds some initial VH instances in existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), generates a text description for each VH mode, and uses a text-to-image generative model (e.g., DALL-E-3) to generate VH images based on the text descriptions. We collect a benchmark dataset with 1,200 VH instances in 8 VH modes using VHTest. We find that existing MLLMs such as GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MiniGPT-v2 hallucinate for a large fraction of the instances in our benchmark. Moreover, we find that fine-tuning an MLLM using our benchmark dataset reduces its likelihood to hallucinate without sacrificing its performance on other benchmarks. Our benchmarks are publicly available: https://github.com/wenhuang2000/VHTest.</description>

      <title>GenNBV: Generalizable Next-Best-View Policy for Active 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advances in neural radiance field enable realistic digitization for large-scale scenes, the image-capturing process is still time-consuming and labor-intensive. Previous works attempt to automate this process using the Next-Best-View (NBV) policy for active 3D reconstruction. However, the existing NBV policies heavily rely on hand-crafted criteria, limited action space, or per-scene optimized representations. These constraints limit their cross-dataset generalizability. To overcome them, we propose GenNBV, an end-to-end generalizable NBV policy. Our policy adopts a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework and extends typical limited action space to 5D free space. It empowers our agent drone to scan from any viewpoint, and even interact with unseen geometries during training. To boost the cross-dataset generalizability, we also propose a novel multi-source state embedding, including geometric, semantic, and action representations. We establish a benchmark using the Isaac Gym simulator with the Houses3K and OmniObject3D datasets to evaluate this NBV policy. Experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves a 98.26% and 97.12% coverage ratio on unseen building-scale objects from these datasets, respectively, outperforming prior solutions.</description>

      <title>Taming the Tail in Class-Conditional GANs: Knowledge Sharing via Unconditional Training at Lower Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on training generative adversarial networks (GANs) with limited training data, learning to generate images from long-tailed training distributions remains fairly unexplored. In the presence of imbalanced multi-class training data, GANs tend to favor classes with more samples, leading to the generation of low-quality and less diverse samples in tail classes. In this study, we aim to improve the training of class-conditional GANs with long-tailed data. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for knowledge sharing, allowing tail classes to borrow from the rich information from classes with more abundant training data. More concretely, we propose modifications to existing class-conditional GAN architectures to ensure that the lower-resolution layers of the generator are trained entirely unconditionally while reserving class-conditional generation for the higher-resolution layers. Experiments on several long-tail benchmarks and GAN architectures demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods in both the diversity and fidelity of the generated images.

      <title>Why Not Use Your Textbook? Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning of Instructional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the capability of an agent to construct a logical sequence of action steps, thereby assembling a strategic procedural plan. This plan is crucial for navigating from an initial visual observation to a target visual outcome, as depicted in real-life instructional videos. Existing works have attained partial success by extensively leveraging various sources of information available in the datasets, such as heavy intermediate visual observations, procedural names, or natural language step-by-step instructions, for features or supervision signals. However, the task remains formidable due to the implicit causal constraints in the sequencing of steps and the variability inherent in multiple feasible plans. To tackle these intricacies that previous efforts have overlooked, we propose to enhance the capabilities of the agent by infusing it with procedural knowledge. This knowledge, sourced from training procedure plans and structured as a directed weighted graph, equips the agent to better navigate the complexities of step sequencing and its potential variations. We coin our approach KEPP, a novel Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning system, which harnesses a probabilistic procedural knowledge graph extracted from training data, effectively acting as a comprehensive textbook for the training domain. Experimental evaluations across three widely-used datasets under settings of varying complexity reveal that KEPP attains superior, state-of-the-art results while requiring only minimal supervision.</description>

Abstract: Tactility provides crucial support and enhancement for the perception and interaction capabilities of both humans and robots. Nevertheless, the multimodal research related to touch primarily focuses on visual and tactile modalities, with limited exploration in the domain of language. Beyond vocabulary, sentence-level descriptions contain richer semantics. Based on this, we construct a touch-language-vision dataset named TLV (Touch-Language-Vision) by human-machine cascade collaboration, featuring sentence-level descriptions for multimode alignment. The new dataset is used to fine-tune our proposed lightweight training framework, STLV-Align (Synergistic Touch-Language-Vision Alignment), achieving effective semantic alignment with minimal parameter adjustments (1%).

      <description>arXiv:2403.11207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructions of visual perception from brain activity have improved tremendously, but the practical utility of such methods has been limited. This is because such models are trained independently per subject where each subject requires dozens of hours of expensive fMRI training data to attain high-quality results. The present work showcases high-quality reconstructions using only 1 hour of fMRI training data. We pretrain our model across 7 subjects and then fine-tune on minimal data from a new subject. Our novel functional alignment procedure linearly maps all brain data to a shared-subject latent space, followed by a shared non-linear mapping to CLIP image space. We then map from CLIP space to pixel space by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL to accept CLIP latents as inputs instead of text. This approach improves out-of-subject generalization with limited training data and also attains state-of-the-art image retrieval and reconstruction metrics compared to single-subject approaches. MindEye2 demonstrates how accurate reconstructions of perception are possible from a single visit to the MRI facility. All code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Human Mesh Recovery from Arbitrary Multi-view Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery from arbitrary multi-view images involves two characteristics: the arbitrary camera poses and arbitrary number of camera views. Because of the variability, designing a unified framework to tackle this task is challenging. The challenges can be summarized as the dilemma of being able to simultaneously estimate arbitrary camera poses and recover human mesh from arbitrary multi-view images while maintaining flexibility. To solve this dilemma, we propose a divide and conquer framework for Unified Human Mesh Recovery (U-HMR) from arbitrary multi-view images. In particular, U-HMR consists of a decoupled structure and two main components: camera and body decoupling (CBD), camera pose estimation (CPE), and arbitrary view fusion (AVF). As camera poses and human body mesh are independent of each other, CBD splits the estimation of them into two sub-tasks for two individual sub-networks (ie, CPE and AVF) to handle respectively, thus the two sub-tasks are disentangled. In CPE, since each camera pose is unrelated to the others, we adopt a shared MLP to process all views in a parallel way. In AVF, in order to fuse multi-view information and make the fusion operation independent of the number of views, we introduce a transformer decoder with a SMPL parameters query token to extract cross-view features for mesh recovery. To demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework and effect of each component, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and TotalCapture.</description>

      <title>Beyond Embeddings: The Promise of Visual Table in Visual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision, involving typical forms such as visual embeddings, structural symbols, and text-based representations. Despite the success of CLIP-type visual embeddings, they often lack access to world knowledge critical for visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel form of visual representation tailored for visual reasoning. Visual tables are constructed as hierarchical descriptions of visual scenes, featuring a scene description and multiple object-centric descriptions covering categories, attributes, and knowledge. Thanks to the structural and textual formats, visual tables offer unique advantages over mere visual embeddings, such as interpretability and controllable editing. Furthermore, they deliver instance-level world knowledge and detailed attributes that are essential for visual reasoning. To create visual tables, we develop a generator trained on the dataset with collected, small-scale annotations. Extensive results on 11 visual reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the generated visual tables significantly outperform previous structural and text-based representations. Moreover, they consistently enhance state-of-the-art multimodal large language models across diverse benchmarks, showcasing their potential for advancing visual reasoning tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Visual-Table.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern video segmentation methods adopt object queries to perform inter-frame association and demonstrate satisfactory performance in tracking continuously appearing objects despite large-scale motion and transient occlusion. However, they all underperform on newly emerging and disappearing objects that are common in the real world because they attempt to model object emergence and disappearance through feature transitions between background and foreground queries that have significant feature gaps. We introduce Dynamic Anchor Queries (DAQ) to shorten the transition gap between the anchor and target queries by dynamically generating anchor queries based on the features of potential candidates. Furthermore, we introduce a query-level object Emergence and Disappearance Simulation (EDS) strategy, which unleashes DAQ's potential without any additional cost. Finally, we combine our proposed DAQ and EDS with DVIS to obtain DVIS-DAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVIS-DAQ achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on five mainstream video segmentation benchmarks.

      <title>SGCNeRF: Few-Shot Neural Rendering via Sparse Geometric Consistency Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) technology has made significant strides in creating novel viewpoints. However, its effectiveness is hampered when working with sparsely available views, often leading to performance dips due to overfitting. FreeNeRF attempts to overcome this limitation by integrating implicit geometry regularization, which incrementally improves both geometry and textures. Nonetheless, an initial low positional encoding bandwidth results in the exclusion of high-frequency elements. The quest for a holistic approach that simultaneously addresses overfitting and the preservation of high-frequency details remains ongoing. This study introduces a novel feature matching based sparse geometry regularization module. This module excels in pinpointing high-frequency keypoints, thereby safeguarding the integrity of fine details. Through progressive refinement of geometry and textures across NeRF iterations, we unveil an effective few-shot neural rendering architecture, designated as SGCNeRF, for enhanced novel view synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that SGCNeRF not only achieves superior geometry-consistent outcomes but also surpasses FreeNeRF, with improvements of 0.7 dB and 0.6 dB in PSNR on the LLFF and DTU datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>YOLC: You Only Look Clusters for Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting objects from aerial images poses significant challenges due to the following factors: 1) Aerial images typically have very large sizes, generally with millions or even hundreds of millions of pixels, while computational resources are limited. 2) Small object size leads to insufficient information for effective detection. 3) Non-uniform object distribution leads to computational resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose YOLC (You Only Look Clusters), an efficient and effective framework that builds on an anchor-free object detector, CenterNet. To overcome the challenges posed by large-scale images and non-uniform object distribution, we introduce a Local Scale Module (LSM) that adaptively searches cluster regions for zooming in for accurate detection. Additionally, we modify the regression loss using Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) to obtain high-quality bounding boxes. Deformable convolution and refinement methods are employed in the detection head to enhance the detection of small objects. We perform extensive experiments on two aerial image datasets, including Visdrone2019 and UAVDT, to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.

      <title>Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality for Certified Robustness via Dual Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) has been proven a promising method for endowing an arbitrary image classifier with certified robustness. However, the substantial uncertainty inherent in the high-dimensional isotropic Gaussian noise imposes the curse of dimensionality on RS. Specifically, the upper bound of ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius provided by RS exhibits a diminishing trend with the expansion of the input dimension $d$, proportionally decreasing at a rate of $1/\sqrt{d}$. This paper explores the feasibility of providing ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness for high-dimensional input through the utilization of dual smoothing in the lower-dimensional space. The proposed Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) down-samples the input image into two sub-images and smooths the two sub-images in lower dimensions. Theoretically, we prove that DRS guarantees a tight ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius for the original input and reveal that DRS attains a superior upper bound on the ${\ell_2}$ robustness radius, which decreases proportionally at a rate of $(1/\sqrt m + 1/\sqrt n )$ with $m+n=d$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of DRS, which exhibits a notable capability to integrate with established methodologies, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness baselines of RS on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

      <title>3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</description>

      <title>MOWA: Multiple-in-One Image Warping Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent image warping approaches achieved remarkable success on existing benchmarks, they still require training separate models for each specific task and cannot generalize well to different camera models or customized manipulations. To address diverse types of warping in practice, we propose a Multiple-in-One image WArping model (named MOWA) in this work. Specifically, we mitigate the difficulty of multi-task learning by disentangling the motion estimation at both the region level and pixel level. To further enable dynamic task-aware image warping, we introduce a lightweight point-based classifier that predicts the task type, serving as prompts to modulate the feature maps for more accurate estimation. To our knowledge, this is the first work that solves multiple practical warping tasks in one single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MOWA, which is trained on six tasks for multiple-in-one image warping, outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models across most tasks. Moreover, MOWA also exhibits promising potential to generalize into unseen scenes, as evidenced by cross-domain and zero-shot evaluations. The code and more visual results can be found on the project page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/mowa/.</description>

      <title>Self-Bootstrapped Visual-Language Model for Knowledge Selection and Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large pre-trained visual-language models have shown promising results on traditional visual question answering benchmarks, it is still challenging for them to answer complex VQA problems which requires diverse world knowledge. Motivated by the research of retrieval-augmented generation in the field of natural language processing, we use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve related knowledge to help the model answer questions. However, DPR conduct retrieving in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of image information. Thus, the retrieved knowledge is not truly conducive to helping answer the question, affecting the performance of the overall system. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages the visual-language model to select the key knowledge retrieved by DPR and answer questions. The framework consists of two modules: Selector and Answerer, where both are initialized by the MLLM and parameter-efficiently finetuned by self-bootstrapping: find key knowledge in the retrieved knowledge documents using the Selector, and then use them to finetune the Answerer to predict answers; obtain the pseudo-labels of key knowledge documents based on the predictions of the Answerer and weak supervision labels, and then finetune the Selector to select key knowledge; repeat. Our framework significantly enhances the performance of the baseline on the challenging open-domain Knowledge-based VQA benchmark, OK-VQA, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.83\%.</description>

      <title>FlowMap: High-Quality Camera Poses, Intrinsics, and Depth via Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces FlowMap, an end-to-end differentiable method that solves for precise camera poses, camera intrinsics, and per-frame dense depth of a video sequence. Our method performs per-video gradient-descent minimization of a simple least-squares objective that compares the optical flow induced by depth, intrinsics, and poses against correspondences obtained via off-the-shelf optical flow and point tracking. Alongside the use of point tracks to encourage long-term geometric consistency, we introduce differentiable re-parameterizations of depth, intrinsics, and pose that are amenable to first-order optimization. We empirically show that camera parameters and dense depth recovered by our method enable photo-realistic novel view synthesis on 360-degree trajectories using Gaussian Splatting. Our method not only far outperforms prior gradient-descent based bundle adjustment methods, but surprisingly performs on par with COLMAP, the state-of-the-art SfM method, on the downstream task of 360-degree novel view synthesis (even though our method is purely gradient-descent based, fully differentiable, and presents a complete departure from conventional SfM).</description>

      <title>Efficient Meta-Learning Enabled Lightweight Multiscale Few-Shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presently, the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in remote sensing images (RSIs) has become a focal point of attention. Numerous few-shot detectors, particularly those based on two-stage detectors, face challenges when dealing with the multiscale complexities inherent in RSIs. Moreover, these detectors present impractical characteristics in real-world applications, mainly due to their unwieldy model parameters when handling large amount of data. In contrast, we recognize the advantages of one-stage detectors, including high detection speed and a global receptive field. Consequently, we choose the YOLOv7 one-stage detector as a baseline and subject it to a novel meta-learning training framework. This transformation allows the detector to adeptly address FSOD tasks while capitalizing on its inherent advantage of lightweight. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the samples generated by the meta-learning strategy and introduce a novel meta-sampling approach to retain samples produced by our designed meta-detection head. Coupled with our devised meta-cross loss, we deliberately utilize "negative samples" that are often overlooked to extract valuable knowledge from them. This approach serves to enhance detection accuracy and efficiently refine the overall meta-learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed detector, we conducted performance comparisons with current state-of-the-art detectors using the DIOR and NWPU VHR-10.v2 datasets, yielding satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Features for Debiasing via Investigating Class-Discerning Common Attributes in Bias-Contrastive Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the image classification task, deep neural networks frequently rely on bias attributes that are spuriously correlated with a target class in the presence of dataset bias, resulting in degraded performance when applied to data without bias attributes. The task of debiasing aims to compel classifiers to learn intrinsic attributes that inherently define a target class rather than focusing on bias attributes. While recent approaches mainly focus on emphasizing the learning of data samples without bias attributes (i.e., bias-conflicting samples) compared to samples with bias attributes (i.e., bias-aligned samples), they fall short of directly guiding models where to focus for learning intrinsic features. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method that provides the model with explicit spatial guidance that indicates the region of intrinsic features. We first identify the intrinsic features by investigating the class-discerning common features between a bias-aligned (BA) sample and a bias-conflicting (BC) sample (i.e., bias-contrastive pair). Next, we enhance the intrinsic features in the BA sample that are relatively under-exploited for prediction compared to the BC sample. To construct the bias-contrastive pair without using bias information, we introduce a bias-negative score that distinguishes BC samples from BA samples employing a biased model. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets with various levels of bias severity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning has emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning. Our source code is available at https://github.com/sangwu99/Simplot.</description>

      <title>Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines Using Feature Fusion Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09152v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As image recognition models become more prevalent, scalable coding methods for machines and humans gain more importance. Applications of image recognition models include traffic monitoring and farm management. In these use cases, the scalable coding method proves effective because the tasks require occasional image checking by humans. Existing image compression methods for humans and machines meet these requirements to some extent. However, these compression methods are effective solely for specific image recognition models. We propose a learning-based scalable image coding method for humans and machines that is compatible with numerous image recognition models. We combine an image compression model for machines with a compression model, providing additional information to facilitate image decoding for humans. The features in these compression models are fused using a feature fusion network to achieve efficient image compression. Our method's additional information compression model is adjusted to reduce the number of parameters by enabling combinations of features of different sizes in the feature fusion network. Our approach confirms that the feature fusion network efficiently combines image compression models while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scalable coding method by evaluating the image compression performance in terms of decoded image quality and bitrate.</description>

      <title>SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.</description>

Abstract: Scalable image coding for both humans and machines is a technique that has gained a lot of attention recently. This technology enables the hierarchical decoding of images for human vision and image recognition models. It is a highly effective method when images need to serve both purposes. However, no research has yet incorporated the post-processing commonly used in popular image compression schemes into scalable image coding method for humans and machines. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the quality of decoded images for humans by integrating post-processing into scalable coding scheme. Experimental results show that the post-processing improves compression performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through comparisons with traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a representative of a new generation of biometrics, vein identification technology offers a high level of security and convenience. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a prominent class of deep learning architectures, have been extensively utilized for vein identification. Since their performance and robustness are limited by small Effective Receptive Fields (e.g. 3$\times$3 kernels) and insufficient training samples, however, they are unable to extract global feature representations from vein images in an effective manner. To address these issues, we propose StarLKNet, a large kernel convolution-based palm-vein identification network, with the Mixup approach. Our StarMix learns effectively the distribution of vein features to expand samples. To enable CNNs to capture comprehensive feature representations from palm-vein images, we explored the effect of convolutional kernel size on the performance of palm-vein identification networks and designed LaKNet, a network leveraging large kernel convolution and gating mechanism. In light of the current state of knowledge, this represents an inaugural instance of the deployment of a CNN with large kernels in the domain of vein identification. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the performance of StarLKNet on two public palm-vein datasets. The results demonstrated that StarMix provided superior augmentation, and LakNet exhibited more stable performance gains compared to mainstream approaches, resulting in the highest recognition accuracy and lowest identification error.</description>

      <title>Defensive Unlearning with Adversarial Training for Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

      <title>PoinTramba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Framework for Point Cloud Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud analysis has seen substantial advancements due to deep learning, although previous Transformer-based methods excel at modeling long-range dependencies on this task, their computational demands are substantial. Conversely, the Mamba offers greater efficiency but shows limited potential compared with Transformer-based methods. In this study, we introduce PoinTramba, a pioneering hybrid framework that synergies the analytical power of Transformer with the remarkable computational efficiency of Mamba for enhanced point cloud analysis. Specifically, our approach first segments point clouds into groups, where the Transformer meticulously captures intricate intra-group dependencies and produces group embeddings, whose inter-group relationships will be simultaneously and adeptly captured by efficient Mamba architecture, ensuring comprehensive analysis. Unlike previous Mamba approaches, we introduce a bi-directional importance-aware ordering (BIO) strategy to tackle the challenges of random ordering effects. This innovative strategy intelligently reorders group embeddings based on their calculated importance scores, significantly enhancing Mamba's performance and optimizing the overall analytical process. Our framework achieves a superior balance between computational efficiency and analytical performance by seamlessly integrating these advanced techniques, marking a substantial leap forward in point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new state-of-the-art analysis benchmark on point cloud recognition. For the first time, this paradigm leverages the combined strengths of both Transformer and Mamba architectures, facilitating a new standard in the field.

      <title>TetSphere Splatting: Representing High-Quality Geometry with Lagrangian Volumetric Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TetSphere splatting, an explicit, Lagrangian representation for reconstructing 3D shapes with high-quality geometry. In contrast to conventional object reconstruction methods which predominantly use Eulerian representations, including both neural implicit (e.g., NeRF, NeuS) and explicit representations (e.g., DMTet), and often struggle with high computational demands and suboptimal mesh quality, TetSphere splatting utilizes an underused but highly effective geometric primitive -- tetrahedral meshes. This approach directly yields superior mesh quality without relying on neural networks or post-processing. It deforms multiple initial tetrahedral spheres to accurately reconstruct the 3D shape through a combination of differentiable rendering and geometric energy optimization, resulting in significant computational efficiency. Serving as a robust and versatile geometry representation, Tet-Sphere splatting seamlessly integrates into diverse applications, including single-view 3D reconstruction, image-/text-to-3D content generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TetSphere splatting outperforms existing representations, delivering faster optimization speed, enhanced mesh quality, and reliable preservation of thin structures.</description>

      <title>Ovis: Structural Embedding Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically integrate a pre-trained LLM with another pre-trained vision transformer through a connector, such as an MLP, endowing the LLM with visual capabilities. However, the misalignment between two embedding strategies in MLLMs -- the structural textual embeddings based on an embedding look-up table and the continuous embeddings generated directly by the vision encoder -- makes challenges for a more seamless fusion of visual and textual information. We propose Ovis, a novel MLLM architecture designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. Ovis integrates an additional learnable visual embedding table into the visual encoder's process. To capture rich visual semantics, each image patch indexes the visual embedding table multiple times, resulting in a final visual embedding that is a probabilistic combination of the indexed embeddings. This structural approach mirrors the method used for generating textual embeddings. Empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks show that Ovis outperforms open-source MLLMs of similar parameter scales and even surpasses the proprietary model Qwen-VL-Plus overall. These results highlight the potential of Ovis' structured visual representation for advancing MLLM architectural design and promoting more effective multimodal learning. Code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Ovis.</description>

      <title>Video-MME: The First-Ever Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark of Multi-modal LLMs in Video Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for artificial general intelligence, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However, the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper, we introduce Video-MME, the first-ever full-spectrum, Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features: 1) Diversity in video types, spanning 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2) Duration in temporal dimension, encompassing both short-, medium-, and long-term videos, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, for robust contextual dynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames, including subtitles and audios, to unveil the all-round capabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations, utilizing rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. 900 videos with a total of 254 hours are manually selected and annotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content, resulting in 2,700 question-answer pairs. With Video-MME, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is the best-performing commercial model, significantly outperforming the open-source models. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data. Project Page: https://video-mme.github.io</description>

      <title>A-SDM: Accelerating Stable Diffusion through Model Assembly and Feature Inheritance Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stable Diffusion Model (SDM) is a prevalent and effective model for text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Despite various attempts at sampler optimization, model distillation, and network quantification, these approaches typically maintain the original network architecture. The extensive parameter scale and substantial computational demands have limited research into adjusting the model architecture. This study focuses on reducing redundant computation in SDM and optimizes the model through both tuning and tuning-free methods. 1) For the tuning method, we design a model assembly strategy to reconstruct a lightweight model while preserving performance through distillation. Second, to mitigate performance loss due to pruning, we incorporate multi-expert conditional convolution (ME-CondConv) into compressed UNets to enhance network performance by increasing capacity without sacrificing speed. Third, we validate the effectiveness of the multi-UNet switching method for improving network speed. 2) For the tuning-free method, we propose a feature inheritance strategy to accelerate inference by skipping local computations at the block, layer, or unit level within the network structure. We also examine multiple sampling modes for feature inheritance at the time-step level. Experiments demonstrate that both the proposed tuning and the tuning-free methods can improve the speed and performance of the SDM. The lightweight model reconstructed by the model assembly strategy increases generation speed by $22.4%$, while the feature inheritance strategy enhances the SDM generation speed by $40.0%$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Informed Augmentation for Robust Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmentation is an integral module in many visual computing applications such as virtual try-on, medical imaging, autonomous driving, and agricultural automation. These applications often involve either widespread consumer use or highly variable environments, both of which can degrade the quality of visual sensor data, whether from a common mobile phone or an expensive satellite imaging camera. In addition to external noises like user difference or weather conditions, internal noises such as variations in camera quality or lens distortion can affect the performance of segmentation models during both development and deployment. In this work, we present an efficient, adaptable, and gradient-free method to enhance the robustness of learning-based segmentation models across training. First, we introduce a novel adaptive sensitivity analysis (ASA) using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) on basis perturbations to benchmark perturbation sensitivity of pre-trained segmentation models. Then, we model the sensitivity curve using the adaptive SA and sample perturbation hyperparameter values accordingly. Finally, we conduct adversarial training with the selected perturbation values and dynamically re-evaluate robustness during online training. Our method, implemented end-to-end with minimal fine-tuning required, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques for segmentation. It shows significant improvement in both clean data evaluation and real-world adverse scenario evaluation across various segmentation datasets used in visual computing and computer graphics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grasping is an important human activity that has long been studied in robotics, computer vision, and cognitive science. Most existing works study grasping from the perspective of synthesizing hand poses conditioned on 3D or 2D object representations. We propose GenHeld to address the inverse problem of synthesizing held objects conditioned on 3D hand model or 2D image. Given a 3D model of hand, GenHeld 3D can select a plausible held object from a large dataset using compact object representations called object codes.The selected object is then positioned and oriented to form a plausible grasp without changing hand pose. If only a 2D hand image is available, GenHeld 2D can edit this image to add or replace a held object. GenHeld 2D operates by combining the abilities of GenHeld 3D with diffusion-based image editing. Results and experiments show that we outperform baselines and can generate plausible held objects in both 2D and 3D. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high quality and plausibility of held object synthesis in both 3D and 2D.</description>

      <title>A DeNoising FPN With Transformer R-CNN for Tiny Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite notable advancements in the field of computer vision, the precise detection of tiny objects continues to pose a significant challenge, largely owing to the minuscule pixel representation allocated to these objects in imagery data. This challenge resonates profoundly in the domain of geoscience and remote sensing, where high-fidelity detection of tiny objects can facilitate a myriad of applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, DeNoising FPN with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), to improve the performance of tiny object detection. DNTR consists of an easy plug-in design, DeNoising FPN (DN-FPN), and an effective Transformer-based detector, Trans R-CNN. Specifically, feature fusion in the feature pyramid network is important for detecting multiscale objects. However, noisy features may be produced during the fusion process since there is no regularization between the features of different scales. Therefore, we introduce a DN-FPN module that utilizes contrastive learning to suppress noise in each level's features in the top-down path of FPN. Second, based on the two-stage framework, we replace the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention. Experimental results manifest that our DNTR outperforms the baselines by at least 17.4% in terms of APvt on the AI-TOD dataset and 9.6% in terms of AP on the VisDrone dataset, respectively. Our code will be available at https://github.com/hoiliu-0801/DNTR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset named HO-Cap that can be used to study 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The capture system uses multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method to obtain annotations of shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, which significantly reduces the required annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans using objects to perform different tasks, as well as simple pick-and-place and handover of an object from one hand to the other, which can be used as human demonstrations for embodied AI and robot manipulation research. Our data capture setup and annotation framework can be used by the community to reconstruct 3D shapes of objects and human hands and track their poses in videos.</description>

      <title>Neural Visibility Field for Uncertainty-Driven Active Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Neural Visibility Field (NVF), a novel uncertainty quantification method for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) applied to active mapping. Our key insight is that regions not visible in the training views lead to inherently unreliable color predictions by NeRF at this region, resulting in increased uncertainty in the synthesized views. To address this, we propose to use Bayesian Networks to composite position-based field uncertainty into ray-based uncertainty in camera observations. Consequently, NVF naturally assigns higher uncertainty to unobserved regions, aiding robots to select the most informative next viewpoints. Extensive evaluations show that NVF excels not only in uncertainty quantification but also in scene reconstruction for active mapping, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Stepwise Regression and Pre-trained Edge for Robust Stereo Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the difficulty in obtaining real samples and ground truth, the generalization performance and the fine-tuned performance are critical for the feasibility of stereo matching methods in real-world applications. However, the presence of substantial disparity distributions and density variations across different datasets presents significant challenges for the generalization and fine-tuning of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel stereo matching method, called SR-Stereo, which mitigates the distributional differences across different datasets by predicting the disparity clips and uses a loss weight related to the regression target scale to improve the accuracy of the disparity clips. Moreover, this stepwise regression architecture can be easily extended to existing iteration-based methods to improve the performance without changing the structure. In addition, to mitigate the edge blurring of the fine-tuned model on sparse ground truth, we propose Domain Adaptation Based on Pre-trained Edges (DAPE). Specifically, we use the predicted disparity and RGB image to estimate the edge map of the target domain image. The edge map is filtered to generate edge map background pseudo-labels, which together with the sparse ground truth disparity on the target domain are used as a supervision to jointly fine-tune the pre-trained stereo matching model. These proposed methods are extensively evaluated on SceneFlow, KITTI, Middbury 2014 and ETH3D. The SR-Stereo achieves competitive disparity estimation performance and state-of-the-art cross-domain generalisation performance. Meanwhile, the proposed DAPE significantly improves the disparity estimation performance of fine-tuned models, especially in the textureless and detail regions.</description>

Abstract: We propose Hydra-MDP, a novel paradigm employing multiple teachers in a teacher-student model. This approach uses knowledge distillation from both human and rule-based teachers to train the student model, which features a multi-head decoder to learn diverse trajectory candidates tailored to various evaluation metrics. With the knowledge of rule-based teachers, Hydra-MDP learns how the environment influences the planning in an end-to-end manner instead of resorting to non-differentiable post-processing. This method achieves the $1^{st}$ place in the Navsim challenge, demonstrating significant improvements in generalization across diverse driving environments and conditions.

      <title>Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Retrieval with 3D Scene Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locating objects referred to in natural language poses a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object retrieval with simple (bare) queries but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene spatial graph representation with metric edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to form 3D objects, an advanced raycasting algorithm to project them to 2D, and a vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On Replica and ScanNet datasets, we show that the designed method accurately constructs 3D object-centric maps. We have demonstrated that their quality takes a leading place for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation against other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On Sr3D and Nr3D benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling retrieving objects by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Considering our design solutions, we achieved a processing speed approximately x3 times faster than the closest analog. This promising performance enables our approach for usage in applied intelligent robotics projects. We make the code publicly available at linukc.github.io/bbq/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the VideoLLaMA 2, a set of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) designed to enhance spatial-temporal modeling and audio understanding in video and audio-oriented tasks. Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data. Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks. Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA &amp; OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models. These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems. All models are public to facilitate further research.</description>

Abstract: Vast amounts of remote sensing (RS) data provide Earth observations across multiple dimensions, encompassing critical spatial, temporal, and spectral information which is essential for addressing global-scale challenges such as land use monitoring, disaster prevention, and environmental change mitigation. Despite various pre-training methods tailored to the characteristics of RS data, a key limitation persists: the inability to effectively integrate spatial, temporal, and spectral information within a single unified model. To unlock the potential of RS data, we construct a Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Structured Dataset (STSSD) characterized by the incorporation of multiple RS sources, diverse coverage, unified locations within image sets, and heterogeneity within images. Building upon this structured dataset, we propose an Anchor-Aware Masked AutoEncoder method (A$^{2}$-MAE), leveraging intrinsic complementary information from the different kinds of images and geo-information to reconstruct the masked patches during the pre-training phase. A$^{2}$-MAE integrates an anchor-aware masking strategy and a geographic encoding module to comprehensively exploit the properties of RS images. Specifically, the proposed anchor-aware masking strategy dynamically adapts the masking process based on the meta-information of a pre-selected anchor image, thereby facilitating the training on images captured by diverse types of RS sources within one model. Furthermore, we propose a geographic encoding method to leverage accurate spatial patterns, enhancing the model generalization capabilities for downstream applications that are generally location-related. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves comprehensive improvements across various downstream tasks compared with existing RS pre-training methods, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Make Your Actor Talk: Generalizable and High-Fidelity Lip Sync with Motion and Appearance Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to edit the lip movements in talking video according to the given speech while preserving the personal identity and visual details. The task can be decomposed into two sub-problems: (1) speech-driven lip motion generation and (2) visual appearance synthesis. Current solutions handle the two sub-problems within a single generative model, resulting in a challenging trade-off between lip-sync quality and visual details preservation. Instead, we propose to disentangle the motion and appearance, and then generate them one by one with a speech-to-motion diffusion model and a motion-conditioned appearance generation model. However, there still remain challenges in each stage, such as motion-aware identity preservation in (1) and visual details preservation in (2). Therefore, to preserve personal identity, we adopt landmarks to represent the motion, and further employ a landmark-based identity loss. To capture motion-agnostic visual details, we use separate encoders to encode the lip, non-lip appearance and motion, and then integrate them with a learned fusion module. We train MyTalk on a large-scale and diverse dataset. Experiments show that our method generalizes well to the unknown, even out-of-domain person, in terms of both lip sync and visual detail preservation. We encourage the readers to watch the videos on our project page (https://Ingrid789.github.io/MyTalk/).</description>

      <title>2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model for 3D Medical Image Translation: Application to Low-count PET Reconstruction with CT-less Attenuation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important clinical imaging tool but inevitably introduces radiation hazards to patients and healthcare providers. Reducing the tracer injection dose and eliminating the CT acquisition for attenuation correction can reduce the overall radiation dose, but often results in PET with high noise and bias. Thus, it is desirable to develop 3D methods to translate the non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET (NAC-LDPET) into attenuation-corrected standard-dose PET (AC-SDPET). Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a new state-of-the-art deep learning method for image-to-image translation, better than traditional CNN-based methods. However, due to the high computation cost and memory burden, it is largely limited to 2D applications. To address these challenges, we developed a novel 2.5D Multi-view Averaging Diffusion Model (MADM) for 3D image-to-image translation with application on NAC-LDPET to AC-SDPET translation. Specifically, MADM employs separate diffusion models for axial, coronal, and sagittal views, whose outputs are averaged in each sampling step to ensure the 3D generation quality from multiple views. To accelerate the 3D sampling process, we also proposed a strategy to use the CNN-based 3D generation as a prior for the diffusion model. Our experimental results on human patient studies suggested that MADM can generate high-quality 3D translation images, outperforming previous CNN-based and Diffusion-based baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Eyes Wide Unshut: Unsupervised Mistake Detection in Egocentric Video by Detecting Unpredictable Gaze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of unsupervised mistake detection in egocentric video through the analysis of gaze signals, a critical component for advancing user assistance in smart glasses. Traditional supervised methods, reliant on manually labeled mistakes, suffer from domain-dependence and scalability issues. This research introduces an unsupervised method for detecting mistakes in videos of human activities, overcoming the challenges of domain-specific requirements and the necessity for annotated data. By analyzing unusual gaze patterns that signal user disorientation during tasks, we propose a gaze completion model that forecasts eye gaze trajectories from incomplete inputs. The difference between the anticipated and observed gaze paths acts as an indicator for identifying errors. Our method is validated on the EPIC-Tent dataset, showing its superiority compared to current one-class supervised and unsupervised techniques.</description>

      <title>Hallo: Hierarchical Audio-Driven Visual Synthesis for Portrait Image Animation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of portrait image animation, driven by speech audio input, has experienced significant advancements in the generation of realistic and dynamic portraits. This research delves into the complexities of synchronizing facial movements and creating visually appealing, temporally consistent animations within the framework of diffusion-based methodologies. Moving away from traditional paradigms that rely on parametric models for intermediate facial representations, our innovative approach embraces the end-to-end diffusion paradigm and introduces a hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis module to enhance the precision of alignment between audio inputs and visual outputs, encompassing lip, expression, and pose motion. Our proposed network architecture seamlessly integrates diffusion-based generative models, a UNet-based denoiser, temporal alignment techniques, and a reference network. The proposed hierarchical audio-driven visual synthesis offers adaptive control over expression and pose diversity, enabling more effective personalization tailored to different identities. Through a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analyses, our approach demonstrates obvious enhancements in image and video quality, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.

      <title>Fine-Grained Domain Generalization with Feature Structuralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task than traditional DG tasks due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the vulnerability of subtle features leads to a severe deterioration in model performance. Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning the commonality and specificity within categories. Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is accomplished through joint optimization of five constraints: a decorrelation function applied to disentangled segments, three constraints ensuring common feature consistency and specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration term. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2% in FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis on explicit concept matching intensity between the shared concepts among categories and the model channels, along with experiments on various mainstream model architectures, substantiates the validity of FS.</description>

      <title>WildlifeReID-10k: Wildlife re-identification dataset with 10k individual animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new wildlife re-identification dataset WildlifeReID-10k with more than 214k images of 10k individual animals. It is a collection of 30 existing wildlife re-identification datasets with additional processing steps. WildlifeReID-10k contains animals as diverse as marine turtles, primates, birds, African herbivores, marine mammals and domestic animals. Due to the ubiquity of similar images in datasets, we argue that the standard (random) splits into training and testing sets are inadequate for wildlife re-identification and propose a new similarity-aware split based on the similarity of extracted features. To promote fair method comparison, we include similarity-aware splits both for closed-set and open-set settings, use MegaDescriptor - a foundational model for wildlife re-identification - for baseline performance and host a leaderboard with the best results. We publicly publish the dataset and the codes used to create it in the wildlife-datasets library, making WildlifeReID-10k both highly curated and easy to use.</description>

      <title>Too Many Frames, not all Useful:Efficient Strategies for Long-Form Video QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely-related. Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA),all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection and sequence-aware captioning, that can significantly reduce these redundancies. We propose two novel approaches that improve each of aspects, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector and Sequential Visual LLM. Our resulting framework termed LVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark LVQA datasets. Our code will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Benefits of Vision Foundation Models for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization across diverse data domains remains a significant challenge in computer vision. This challenge is important in safety-critical applications, where deep-neural-network-based systems must perform reliably under various environmental conditions not seen during training. Our study investigates whether the generalization capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for the semantic segmentation task are complementary. Results show that combining VFMs with UDA has two main benefits: (a) it allows for better UDA performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution performance of VFMs, and (b) it makes certain time-consuming UDA components redundant, thus enabling significant inference speedups. Specifically, with equivalent model sizes, the resulting VFM-UDA method achieves an 8.4$\times$ speed increase over the prior non-VFM state of the art, while also improving performance by +1.2 mIoU in the UDA setting and by +6.1 mIoU in terms of out-of-distribution generalization. Moreover, when we use a VFM with 3.6$\times$ more parameters, the VFM-UDA approach maintains a 3.3$\times$ speed up, while improving the UDA performance by +3.1 mIoU and the out-of-distribution performance by +10.3 mIoU. These results underscore the significant benefits of combining VFMs with UDA, setting new standards and baselines for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Semantic Continuity for Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.09789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models suffer from the problem of semantic discontinuity: small perturbations in the input space tend to cause semantic-level interference to the model output. We argue that the semantic discontinuity results from these inappropriate training targets and contributes to notorious issues such as adversarial robustness, interpretability, etc. We first conduct data analysis to provide evidence of semantic discontinuity in existing deep learning models, and then design a simple semantic continuity constraint which theoretically enables models to obtain smooth gradients and learn semantic-oriented features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments prove that semantically continuous models successfully reduce the use of non-semantic information, which further contributes to the improvement in adversarial robustness, interpretability, model transfer, and machine bias.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$DecNet+: A new architecture framework by $\ell_1$ decomposition and iteration unfolding for sparse feature segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\ell_1$ based sparse regularization plays a central role in compressive sensing and image processing. In this paper, we propose $\ell_1$DecNet, as an unfolded network derived from a variational decomposition model incorporating $\ell_1$ related sparse regularization and solved by scaled alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). $\ell_1$DecNet effectively decomposes an input image into a sparse feature and a learned dense feature, and thus helps the subsequent sparse feature related operations. Based on this, we develop $\ell_1$DecNet+, a learnable architecture framework consisting of our $\ell_1$DecNet and a segmentation module which operates over extracted sparse features instead of original images. This architecture combines well the benefits of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate mathematical image prior into feature extraction in segmentation network structures. Moreover, our $\ell_1$DecNet+ framework can be easily extended to 3D case. We evaluate the effectiveness of $\ell_1$DecNet+ on two commonly encountered sparse segmentation tasks: retinal vessel segmentation in medical image processing and pavement crack detection in industrial abnormality identification. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that, our $\ell_1$DecNet+ architecture with various lightweight segmentation modules can achieve equal or better performance than their enlarged versions respectively. This leads to especially practical advantages on resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generative Networks for Chest Anomaly Localization through Automatic Registration-Based Unpaired-to-Pseudo-Paired Training Data Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image translation based on a generative adversarial network (GAN-IT) is a promising method for the precise localization of abnormal regions in chest X-ray images (AL-CXR) even without the pixel-level annotation. However, heterogeneous unpaired datasets undermine existing methods to extract key features and distinguish normal from abnormal cases, resulting in inaccurate and unstable AL-CXR. To address this problem, we propose an improved two-stage GAN-IT involving registration and data augmentation. For the first stage, we introduce an advanced deep-learning-based registration technique that virtually and reasonably converts unpaired data into paired data for learning registration maps, by sequentially utilizing linear-based global and uniform coordinate transformation and AI-based non-linear coordinate fine-tuning. This approach enables independent and complex coordinate transformation of each detailed location of the lung while recognizing the entire lung structure, thereby achieving higher registration performance with resolving inherent artifacts caused by unpaired conditions. For the second stage, we apply data augmentation to diversify anomaly locations by swapping the left and right lung regions on the uniform registered frames, further improving the performance by alleviating imbalance in data distribution showing left and right lung lesions. The proposed method is model agnostic and shows consistent AL-CXR performance improvement in representative AI models. Therefore, we believe GAN-IT for AL-CXR can be clinically implemented by using our basis framework, even if learning data are scarce or difficult for the pixel-level disease annotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable asset for patient-specific cardiovascular-disease diagnosis and prognosis, but its high computational demands hamper its adoption in practice. Machine-learning methods that estimate blood flow in individual patients could accelerate or replace CFD simulation to overcome these limitations. In this work, we consider the estimation of vector-valued quantities on the wall of three-dimensional geometric artery models. We employ group equivariant graph convolution in an end-to-end SE(3)-equivariant neural network that operates directly on triangular surface meshes and makes efficient use of training data. We run experiments on a large dataset of synthetic coronary arteries and find that our method estimates directional wall shear stress (WSS) with an approximation error of 7.6% and normalised mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.4% while up to two orders of magnitude faster than CFD. Furthermore, we show that our method is powerful enough to accurately predict transient, vector-valued WSS over the cardiac cycle while conditioned on a range of different inflow boundary conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method as a plugin replacement for CFD in the personalised prediction of hemodynamic vector and scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder because of damage to the eye's retina which can affect babies born prematurely. Screening of ROP is essential for early detection and treatment. This is a laborious and manual process which requires trained physician performing dilated ophthalmological examination which can be subjective resulting in lower diagnosis success for clinically significant disease. Automated diagnostic methods can assist ophthalmologists increase diagnosis accuracy using deep learning. Several research groups have highlighted various approaches. Captured ROP Retcam images suffer from poor quality. This paper proposes the use of improved novel fundus preprocessing methods using pretrained transfer learning frameworks to create hybrid models to give higher diagnosis accuracy. Once trained and validated, the evaluations showed that these novel methods in comparison to traditional imaging processing contribute to better and in many aspects higher accuracy in classifying Plus disease, Stages of ROP and Zones in comparison to peer papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09780v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swift and accurate diagnosis for earlier-stage monkeypox (mpox) patients is crucial to avoiding its spread. However, the similarities between common skin disorders and mpox and the need for professional diagnosis unavoidably impaired the diagnosis of earlier-stage mpox patients and contributed to mpox outbreak. To address the challenge, we proposed "Super Monitoring", a real-time visualization technique employing artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet technology to diagnose earlier-stage mpox cheaply, conveniently, and quickly. Concretely, AI-mediated "Super Monitoring" (mpox-AISM) integrates deep learning models, data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and cloud services. According to publicly accessible datasets, mpox-AISM's Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1-score in diagnosing mpox reach 99.3%, 94.1%, 99.9%, and 96.6%, respectively, and it achieves 94.51% accuracy in diagnosing mpox, six like-mpox skin disorders, and normal skin. With the Internet and communication terminal, mpox-AISM has the potential to perform real-time and accurate diagnosis for earlier-stage mpox in real-world scenarios, thereby preventing mpox outbreak.</description>

      <title>Dual Degradation Representation for Joint Deraining and Low-Light Enhancement in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rain in the dark poses a significant challenge to deploying real-world applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and night photography. Existing low-light enhancement or deraining methods struggle to brighten low-light conditions and remove rain simultaneously. Additionally, cascade approaches like ``deraining followed by low-light enhancement'' or the reverse often result in problematic rain patterns or overly blurred and overexposed images. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end model called L$^{2}$RIRNet, designed to manage both low-light enhancement and deraining in real-world settings. Our model features two main components: a Dual Degradation Representation Network (DDR-Net) and a Restoration Network. The DDR-Net independently learns degradation representations for luminance effects in dark areas and rain patterns in light areas, employing dual degradation loss to guide the training process. The Restoration Network restores the degraded image using a Fourier Detail Guidance (FDG) module, which leverages near-rainless detailed images, focusing on texture details in frequency and spatial domains to inform the restoration process. Furthermore, we contribute a dataset containing both synthetic and real-world low-light-rainy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our L$^{2}$RIRNet performs favorably against existing methods in both synthetic and complex real-world scenarios. All the code and dataset can be found in \url{https://github.com/linxin0/Low_light_rainy}.</description>

      <title>ArtWhisperer: A Dataset for Characterizing Human-AI Interactions in Artistic Creations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to study how human users interact with such models. In this work, we investigate how people use text-to-image models to generate desired target images. To study this interaction, we created ArtWhisperer, an online game where users are given a target image and are tasked with iteratively finding a prompt that creates a similar-looking image as the target. Through this game, we recorded over 50,000 human-AI interactions; each interaction corresponds to one text prompt created by a user and the corresponding generated image. The majority of these are repeated interactions where a user iterates to find the best prompt for their target image, making this a unique sequential dataset for studying human-AI collaborations. In an initial analysis of this dataset, we identify several characteristics of prompt interactions and user strategies. People submit diverse prompts and are able to discover a variety of text descriptions that generate similar images. Interestingly, prompt diversity does not decrease as users find better prompts. We further propose a new metric to quantify the steerability of AI using our dataset. We define steerability as the expected number of interactions required to adequately complete a task. We estimate this value by fitting a Markov chain for each target task and calculating the expected time to reach an adequate score in the Markov chain. We quantify and compare AI steerability across different types of target images and two different models, finding that images of cities and natural world images are more steerable than artistic and fantasy images. These findings provide insights into human-AI interaction behavior, present a concrete method of assessing AI steerability, and demonstrate the general utility of the ArtWhisperer dataset.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off via Balanced Multi-Teacher Adversarial Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial Training is a practical approach for improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Although bringing reliable robustness, the performance towards clean examples is negatively affected after Adversarial Training, which means a trade-off exists between accuracy and robustness. Recently, some studies have tried to use knowledge distillation methods in Adversarial Training, achieving competitive performance in improving the robustness but the accuracy for clean samples is still limited. In this paper, to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off, we introduce the Balanced Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robustness Distillation (B-MTARD) to guide the model's Adversarial Training process by applying a strong clean teacher and a strong robust teacher to handle the clean examples and adversarial examples, respectively. During the optimization process, to ensure that different teachers show similar knowledge scales, we design the Entropy-Based Balance algorithm to adjust the teacher's temperature and keep the teachers' information entropy consistent. Besides, to ensure that the student has a relatively consistent learning speed from multiple teachers, we propose the Normalization Loss Balance algorithm to adjust the learning weights of different types of knowledge. A series of experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that B-MTARD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods against various adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Assessment and Optimization of HDR Image Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12877v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) rendering has the ability to faithfully reproduce the wide luminance ranges in natural scenes, but how to accurately assess the rendering quality is relatively underexplored. Existing quality models are mostly designed for low dynamic range (LDR) images, and do not align well with human perception of HDR image quality. To fill this gap, we propose a family of HDR quality metrics, in which the key step is employing a simple inverse display model to decompose an HDR image into a stack of LDR images with varying exposures. Subsequently, these decomposed images are assessed through well-established LDR quality metrics. Our HDR quality models present three distinct benefits. First, they directly inherit the recent advancements of LDR quality metrics. Second, they do not rely on human perceptual data of HDR image quality for re-calibration. Third, they facilitate the alignment and prioritization of specific luminance ranges for more accurate and detailed quality assessment. Experimental results show that our HDR quality metrics consistently outperform existing models in terms of quality assessment on four HDR image quality datasets and perceptual optimization of HDR novel view synthesis.</description>

      <title>Progressive Dual Priori Network for Generalized Breast Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To promote the generalization ability of breast tumor segmentation models, as well as to improve the segmentation performance for breast tumors with smaller size, low-contrast and irregular shape, we propose a progressive dual priori network (PDPNet) to segment breast tumors from dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) acquired at different centers. The PDPNet first cropped tumor regions with a coarse-segmentation based localization module, then the breast tumor mask was progressively refined by using the weak semantic priori and cross-scale correlation prior knowledge. To validate the effectiveness of PDPNet, we compared it with several state-of-the-art methods on multi-center datasets. The results showed that, comparing against the suboptimal method, the DSC and HD95 of PDPNet were improved at least by 5.13% and 7.58% respectively on multi-center test sets. In addition, through ablations, we demonstrated that the proposed localization module can decrease the influence of normal tissues and therefore improve the generalization ability of the model. The weak semantic priors allow focusing on tumor regions to avoid missing small tumors and low-contrast tumors. The cross-scale correlation priors are beneficial for promoting the shape-aware ability for irregular tumors. Thus integrating them in a unified framework improved the multi-center breast tumor segmentation performance.

      <title>RoboGen: Towards Unleashing Infinite Data for Automated Robot Learning via Generative Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RoboGen, a generative robotic agent that automatically learns diverse robotic skills at scale via generative simulation. RoboGen leverages the latest advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of directly using or adapting these models to produce policies or low-level actions, we advocate for a generative scheme, which uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks, scenes, and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic skill learning with minimal human supervision. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided propose-generate-learn cycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then generates corresponding simulation environments by populating pertinent objects and assets with proper spatial configurations. Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed high-level task into sub-tasks, selects the optimal learning approach (reinforcement learning, motion planning, or trajectory optimization), generates required training supervision, and then learns policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our work attempts to extract the extensive and versatile knowledge embedded in large-scale models and transfer them to the field of robotics. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill demonstrations associated with diverse tasks and environments.</description>

      <title>SISMIK for brain MRI: Deep-learning-based motion estimation and model-based motion correction in k-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MRI, a widespread non-invasive medical imaging modality, is highly sensitive to patient motion. Despite many attempts over the years, motion correction remains a difficult problem and there is no general method applicable to all situations. We propose a retrospective method for motion estimation and correction to tackle the problem of in-plane rigid-body motion, apt for classical 2D Spin-Echo scans of the brain, which are regularly used in clinical practice. Due to the sequential acquisition of k-space, motion artifacts are well localized. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks to estimate motion parameters in k-space and uses a model-based approach to restore degraded images to avoid ''hallucinations''. Notable advantages are its ability to estimate motion occurring in high spatial frequencies without the need of a motion-free reference. The proposed method operates on the whole k-space dynamic range and is moderately affected by the lower SNR of higher harmonics. As a proof of concept, we provide models trained using supervised learning on 600k motion simulations based on motion-free scans of 43 different subjects. Generalization performance was tested with simulations as well as in-vivo. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are presented for motion parameter estimations and image reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach is able to obtain good generalization performance on simulated data and in-vivo acquisitions. We provide a Python implementation at https://gitlab.unige.ch/Oscar.Dabrowski/sismik_mri/.</description>

      <title>QUAR-VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model for Quadruped Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The important manifestation of robot intelligence is the ability to naturally interact and autonomously make decisions. Traditional approaches to robot control often compartmentalize perception, planning, and decision-making, simplifying system design but limiting the synergy between different information streams. This compartmentalization poses challenges in achieving seamless autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and action execution. To address these limitations, a novel paradigm, named Vision-Language-Action tasks for QUAdruped Robots (QUAR-VLA), has been introduced in this paper. This approach tightly integrates visual information and instructions to generate executable actions, effectively merging perception, planning, and decision-making. The central idea is to elevate the overall intelligence of the robot. Within this framework, a notable challenge lies in aligning fine-grained instructions with visual perception information. This emphasizes the complexity involved in ensuring that the robot accurately interprets and acts upon detailed instructions in harmony with its visual observations. Consequently, we propose QUAdruped Robotic Transformer (QUART), a family of VLA models to integrate visual information and instructions from diverse modalities as input and generates executable actions for real-world robots and present QUAdruped Robot Dataset (QUARD), a large-scale multi-task dataset including navigation, complex terrain locomotion, and whole-body manipulation tasks for training QUART models. Our extensive evaluation (4000 evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables QUART to obtain a range of emergent capabilities.</description>

      <title>SAFE-SIM: Safety-Critical Closed-Loop Traffic Simulation with Controllable Adversaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle planning algorithms necessitates simulating long-tail safety-critical traffic scenarios. However, traditional methods for generating such scenarios often fall short in terms of controllability and realism and neglect the dynamics of agent interactions. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SAFE-SIM, a novel diffusion-based controllable closed-loop safety-critical simulation framework. Our approach yields two distinct advantages: 1) the generation of realistic long-tail safety-critical scenarios that closely emulate real-world conditions, and 2) enhanced controllability, enabling more comprehensive and interactive evaluations. We develop a novel approach to simulate safety-critical scenarios through an adversarial term in the denoising process, which allows an adversarial agent to challenge a planner with plausible maneuvers while all agents in the scene exhibit reactive and realistic behaviors. Furthermore, we propose novel guidance objectives and a partial diffusion process that enables a user to control key aspects of the generated scenarios, such as the collision type and aggressiveness of the adversarial driver, while maintaining the realism of the behavior. We validate our framework empirically using the NuScenes dataset, demonstrating improvements in both realism and controllability. These findings affirm that diffusion models provide a robust and versatile foundation for safety-critical, interactive traffic simulation, extending their utility across the broader landscape of autonomous driving.

      <title>MLLM-Protector: Ensuring MLLM's Safety without Hurting Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought forth a unique vulnerability: susceptibility to malicious attacks through visual inputs. This paper investigates the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. Compared to large language models (LLMs), MLLMs include an additional image modality. We discover that images act as a ``foreign language" that is not considered during safety alignment, making MLLMs more prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover all possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most state-of-the-art MLLMs are fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that are much fewer than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during safety fine-tuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a plug-and-play strategy that solves two subtasks: 1) identifying harmful responses via a lightweight harm detector, and 2) transforming harmful responses into harmless ones via a detoxifier. This approach effectively mitigates the risks posed by malicious visual inputs without compromising the original performance of MLLMs. Our results demonstrate that MLLM-Protector offers a robust solution to a previously unaddressed aspect of MLLM security.</description>

      <title>MMToM-QA: Multimodal Theory of Mind Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental states, is an essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM benchmarks use unimodal datasets - either video or text. Human ToM, on the other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g., goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we introduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and language models.</description>

      <title>Weakly Convex Regularisers for Inverse Problems: Convergence of Critical Points and Primal-Dual Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational regularisation is the primary method for solving inverse problems, and recently there has been considerable work leveraging deeply learned regularisation for enhanced performance. However, few results exist addressing the convergence of such regularisation, particularly within the context of critical points as opposed to global minimisers. In this paper, we present a generalised formulation of convergent regularisation in terms of critical points, and show that this is achieved by a class of weakly convex regularisers. We prove convergence of the primal-dual hybrid gradient method for the associated variational problem, and, given a Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz condition, an $\mathcal{O}(\log{k}/k)$ ergodic convergence rate. Finally, applying this theory to learned regularisation, we prove universal approximation for input weakly convex neural networks (IWCNN), and show empirically that IWCNNs can lead to improved performance of learned adversarial regularisers for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Uni-SMART: Universal Science Multimodal Analysis and Research Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scientific research and its application, scientific literature analysis is crucial as it allows researchers to build on the work of others. However, the fast growth of scientific knowledge has led to a massive increase in scholarly articles, making in-depth literature analysis increasingly challenging and time-consuming. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has offered a new way to address this challenge. Known for their strong abilities in summarizing texts, LLMs are seen as a potential tool to improve the analysis of scientific literature. However, existing LLMs have their own limits. Scientific literature often includes a wide range of multimodal elements, such as tables, charts, and molecule, which are hard for text-focused LLMs to understand and analyze. This issue points to the urgent need for new solutions that can fully understand and analyze multimodal content in scientific literature. To answer this demand, we present \textbf{Uni-SMART} (Universal Science Multimodal Analysis and Research Transformer), an innovative model designed for in-depth understanding of multimodal scientific literature. Through rigorous quantitative evaluation across several domains, Uni-SMART demonstrates superior performance over other text-focused LLMs. Furthermore, our exploration extends to practical applications, including patent infringement detection and nuanced analysis of charts. These applications not only highlight Uni-SMART's adaptability but also its potential to revolutionize how we interact with scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Imaging based on the Variance of a Diffusion Restoration Model</title>

Abstract: Despite today's prevalence of ultrasound imaging in medicine, ultrasound signal-to-noise ratio is still affected by several sources of noise and artefacts. Moreover, enhancing ultrasound image quality involves balancing concurrent factors like contrast, resolution, and speckle preservation. Recently, there has been progress in both model-based and learning-based approaches addressing the problem of ultrasound image reconstruction. Bringing the best from both worlds, we propose a hybrid reconstruction method combining an ultrasound linear direct model with a learning-based prior coming from a generative Denoising Diffusion model. More specifically, we rely on the unsupervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Restoration Model (DDRM). Given the nature of multiplicative noise inherent to ultrasound, this paper proposes an empirical model to characterize the stochasticity of diffusion reconstruction of ultrasound images, and shows the interest of its variance as an echogenicity map estimator. We conduct experiments on synthetic, in-vitro, and in-vivo data, demonstrating the efficacy of our variance imaging approach in achieving high-quality image reconstructions from single plane-wave acquisitions and in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Bayesian Example Selection Improves In-Context Learning for Speech, Text, and Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) based on a few examples presented in dialogue history without any model parameter update. Despite such convenience, the performance of ICL heavily depends on the quality of the in-context examples presented, which makes the in-context example selection approach a critical choice. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes' theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples. Experimental results show the efficacy and robustness of our ByCS method on various models, tasks and modalities.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Task-based Effectiveness of MLLMs on Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a forward-thinking question: Is GPT-4V effective at low-level data analysis tasks on charts? To this end, we first curate a large-scale dataset, named ChartInsights, consisting of 89,388 quartets (chart, task, question, answer) and covering 10 widely-used low-level data analysis tasks on 7 chart types. Firstly, we conduct systematic evaluations to understand the capabilities and limitations of 18 advanced MLLMs, which include 12 open-source models and 6 closed-source models. Starting with a standard textual prompt approach, the average accuracy rate across the 18 MLLMs is 36.17%. Among all the models, GPT-4V achieves the highest accuracy, reaching 56.13%. To understand the limitations of multimodal large models in low-level data analysis tasks, we have designed various experiments to conduct an in-depth test of capabilities of GPT-4V. We further investigate how visual modifications to charts, such as altering visual elements (e.g. changing color schemes) and introducing perturbations (e.g. adding image noise), affect performance of GPT-4V. Secondly, we present 12 experimental findings. These findings suggest potential of GPT-4V to revolutionize interaction with charts and uncover the gap between human analytic needs and capabilities of GPT-4V. Thirdly, we propose a novel textual prompt strategy, named Chain-of-Charts, tailored for low-level analysis tasks, which boosts model performance by 24.36%, resulting in an accuracy of 80.49%. Furthermore, by incorporating a visual prompt strategy that directs attention of GPT-4V to question-relevant visual elements, we further improve accuracy to 83.83%. Our study not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of GPT-4V in low-level data analysis tasks but also offers valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Improving GFlowNets for Text-to-Image Diffusion Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</description>

      <title>Grounding Continuous Representations in Geometry: Equivariant Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Neural Fields have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm to represent continuous signals. In a conditional neural field, a field is represented by a latent variable that conditions the NeF, whose parametrisation is otherwise shared over an entire dataset. We propose Equivariant Neural Fields based on cross attention transformers, in which NeFs are conditioned on a geometric conditioning variable, a latent point cloud, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. Our equivariant approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws if the field transforms, the latent represents transforms accordingly and vice versa. Crucially, the equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weightsharing over spatially similar patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. These main properties are validated using classification experiments and a verification of the capability of fitting entire datasets, in comparison to other non-equivariant NeF approaches. We further validate the potential of ENFs by demonstrate unique local field editing properties.</description>

      <title>An Open and Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Modal Climate Change-aware Crop Yield Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise crop yield predictions are of national importance for ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices. While AI-for-science approaches have exhibited promising achievements in solving many scientific problems such as drug discovery, precipitation nowcasting, etc., the development of deep learning models for predicting crop yields is constantly hindered by the lack of an open and large-scale deep learning-ready dataset with multiple modalities to accommodate sufficient information. To remedy this, we introduce the CropNet dataset, the first terabyte-sized, publicly available, and multi-modal dataset specifically targeting climate change-aware crop yield predictions for the contiguous United States (U.S.) continent at the county level. Our CropNet dataset is composed of three modalities of data, i.e., Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, for over 2200 U.S. counties spanning 6 years (2017-2022), expected to facilitate researchers in developing versatile deep learning models for timely and precisely predicting crop yields at the county-level, by accounting for the effects of both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change on crop yields. Besides, we develop the CropNet package, offering three types of APIs, for facilitating researchers in downloading the CropNet data on the fly over the time and region of interest, and flexibly building their deep learning models for accurate crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on our CropNet dataset via employing various types of deep learning solutions, with the results validating the general applicability and the efficacy of the CropNet dataset in climate change-aware crop yield predictions.</description>

      <title>Direct Preference Optimization for Suppressing Hallucinated Prior Exams in Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative vision-language models (VLMs) have exciting potential implications for AI in radiology, yet VLMs are also known to produce hallucinations, nonsensical text, and other unwanted behaviors that can waste clinicians' time and cause patient harm. Drawing on recent work on direct preference optimization (DPO), we propose a simple method for modifying the behavior of pretrained VLMs performing radiology report generation by suppressing unwanted types of generations. We apply our method to the prevention of hallucinations of prior exams, addressing a long-established problem behavior in models performing chest X-ray report generation. Across our experiments, we find that DPO fine-tuning achieves a 3.2-4.8x reduction in lines hallucinating prior exams while maintaining model performance on clinical accuracy metrics. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to apply DPO to medical VLMs, providing a data- and compute- efficient way to suppress problem behaviors while maintaining overall clinical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fetch-A-Set: A Large-Scale OCR-Free Benchmark for Historical Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fetch-A-Set (FAS), a comprehensive benchmark tailored for legislative historical document analysis systems, addressing the challenges of large-scale document retrieval in historical contexts. The benchmark comprises a vast repository of documents dating back to the XVII century, serving both as a training resource and an evaluation benchmark for retrieval systems. It fills a critical gap in the literature by focusing on complex extractive tasks within the domain of cultural heritage. The proposed benchmark tackles the multifaceted problem of historical document analysis, including text-to-image retrieval for queries and image-to-text topic extraction from document fragments, all while accommodating varying levels of document legibility. This benchmark aims to spur advancements in the field by providing baselines and data for the development and evaluation of robust historical document retrieval systems, particularly in scenarios characterized by wide historical spectrum.</description>
