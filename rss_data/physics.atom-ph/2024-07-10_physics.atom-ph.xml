      <title>Atom interferometry in an Einstein Elevator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in atom interferometry have led to the development of quantum inertial sensors with outstanding performance in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and long-term stability. For ground-based implementations, these sensors are ultimately limited by the free-fall height of atomic fountains required to interrogate the atoms over extended timescales. This limitation can be overcome in Space and in unique ``microgravity'' facilities such as drop towers or free-falling aircraft. These facilities require large investments, long development times, and place stringent constraints on instruments that further limit their widespread use. The available ``up time'' for experiments is also quite low, making extended studies challenging. In this work, we present a new approach in which atom interferometry is performed in a laboratory-scale Einstein Elevator. Our experiment is mounted to a moving platform that mimics the vertical free-fall trajectory every 13.5 seconds. With a total interrogation time of $2T = 200$ ms, we demonstrate an acceleration sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^{2}$ per shot, limited primarily by the temperature of our atomic samples. We further demonstrate the capability to perform long-term statistical studies by operating the Einstein Elevator over several days with high reproducibility. These represent state-of-the-art results achieved in microgravity and further demonstrates the potential of quantum inertial sensors in Space. Our microgravity platform is both an alternative to large atomic fountains and a versatile facility to prepare future Space missions.</description>

      <title>A note on the emission spectrum and trapping states in the Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission of light from an atom represents a fundamental process that provides valuable insights into the atom-light interaction. The Jaynes-Cummings model is one of the simplest fully quantized models to deal with these interactions, allowing for an analytical solution, while exhibiting notable non-trivial effects. We explore new features in the fluorescence emission spectrum for initial "trapping states", which suppress the atomic population inversion. Despite the seemingly dormant activity of the atom, the resulting emission spectra exhibit rich features, and using a dressed-state coordinates formalism, we are able to quantitatively explain the different profiles in the spectrum. We generalize the trapping conditions for non-zero atom-field detuning and also unveil two types of trapping states that lead to spectra with three peaks, in contrast to previously known states: a center peak and one secondary peak on each side. These are a trapping state formed by a Schr\"odinger cat state with Poissonian statistics (Yurke-Stoler state) and also a different type of "perfect trapping state".</description>

      <title>Scalable, high-fidelity all-electronic control of trapped-ion qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central challenge of quantum computing is implementing high-fidelity quantum gates at scale. However, many existing approaches to qubit control suffer from a scale-performance trade-off, impeding progress towards the creation of useful devices. Here, we present a vision for an electronically controlled trapped-ion quantum computer that alleviates this bottleneck. Our architecture utilizes shared current-carrying traces and local tuning electrodes in a microfabricated chip to perform quantum gates with low noise and crosstalk regardless of device size. To verify our approach, we experimentally demonstrate low-noise site-selective single- and two-qubit gates in a seven-zone ion trap that can control up to 10 qubits. We implement electronic single-qubit gates with 99.99916(7)% fidelity, and demonstrate consistent performance with low crosstalk across the device. We also electronically generate two-qubit maximally entangled states with 99.97(1)% fidelity and long-term stable performance over continuous system operation. These state-of-the-art results validate the path to directly scaling these techniques to large-scale quantum computers based on electronically controlled trapped-ion qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics in Strong Electromagnetic Fields: Substate Resolved K$\alpha$ Transition Energies in Helium-like Uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using novel metallic magnetic calorimeter detectors at the CRYRING@ESR, we recorded X-ray spectra of stored and electron cooled helium-like uranium (U$^{90+}$) with an unmatched spectral resolution of close to 90 eV. This allowed for an accurate determination of the energies of all four components of the K$\alpha$ transitions in U$^{90+}$. We find good agreement with state-of-the-art bound-state QED calculations for the strong-field regime. Our results do not support any systematic deviation between experiment and theory in helium-like systems, the presence of which was subject of intense debates in recent years.</description>
