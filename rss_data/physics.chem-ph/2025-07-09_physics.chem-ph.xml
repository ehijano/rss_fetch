      <title>A Multi-Electronic-State Model to Interpret the Apparent Anomalous Arrhenius Curve of OH + HO$_2$ $\to$ O$_2$ + H$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive multi-electronic-state model for OH + HO2 -&gt; O2 + H2O has been developed through extensive multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations, aiming to elucidate two key experimental observations: (1) an unusually deep and narrow ``well'' in the Arrhenius curve near 1100K and (2) a slightly negative temperature dependence in the range of 200K~500K. Moreover, the present model can serve as the basis for constructing multi-state Hamiltonian in multi-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations. The present model incorporates eight state-to-state processes involving OH (X) + HO2 (X/A), where three of four processes associated with HO2 (X) are exothermic, while those associated with HO2 (A) have three endothermic channels with the smallest barrier of 0.107 eV. At temperatures below 500K, the processes of HO2 (A) remain inaccessible, and the dominance of exothermic pathways results in a temperature-independent rate constant. To enable HO2 excitation at temperatures above 900K, a black-body radiation model that facilitates endothermic processes is introduced and reproduces the reduction factor of 0.3711 at 1100K. This value falls within the experimentally observed range of 0.30~0.76. Furthermore, a recombination process involving HO2 (A) is proposed to provide additional reduction of the rate constant. In conjunction with our previous works (J. Chem. Phys. 152 (2020), 134309 and J. Chem. Theory Comput. 20 (2024), 597), predicted values of the rate constants are well agree with experiments. At elevated temperatures exceeding 1242K (namely &gt;0.107eV), the overall rate constant becomes temperature-dependent due to the activation of endothermic processes, leading to a distinct well in the Arrhenius curve between 900K and 1242K.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Wavepacket Propagation Framework via ML-MCTDH for Molecular Reaction Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics via wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core methodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine several coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the degrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode. First, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer, and these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a hierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are achieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically. Second, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP) of single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while the potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of single-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using an existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third, the nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where each term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further expanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by variational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose solutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework can be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree tensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by function with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations of the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Effects of Nuclei in Chemical Reaction Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In calculations on quantum state-resolved dynamics of a chemical reaction, reactants are usually prepared in separated eigenstates of individual fragments, and their direct-product is then evolved in time. In this work, we focus on the essence in separating them and the Berry phase effects of the nuclear wave function. By the present theory, mechanism of inter/intramolecular energy redistribution is also proposed to deeply understand reactive dynamics with multirovibrational states. To demonstrate the phase transition of the nuclear wave function, two three-dimensional (3D) models reductively describing the molecular reaction are developed to simulate transport of the system along a closed path in a parameter space represented of inter/intramolecular energy transfers. Employing these 3D models, extensive multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) calculations are performed to solve the time-dependent nuclear Schr{\"o}dinger equation at various initial conditions. Moreover, 98D multilayer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH) calculations are launched to demonstrate the transition of Berry phase. These calculations clearly indicate that the wave function can change sign allowing quantum interference in the parameter space. Discussions on the separation of the reactants are made, while perspectives on the Berry phase effects predicted by the present work are given from the viewpoint of differential geometry. As a conclusion remark, the Berry phase effects on molecular dynamics are also thoroughly compared with those on electronic properties (see, for example, {\it Rev. Mod. Phys.} {\bf 82} (2010), 1959) and mode/bond-specific reactivity (see, for example, {\it Nat. Chem.} {\bf 14} (2022), 545).</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Growth Dynamics of Size-selected Carbon Atomic Wires with in situ UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short carbon atomic wires, the prototypes of the lacking carbon allotrope carbyne, represent the fundamental one-dimensional system and the first stage in carbon nanostructure growth, which still exhibits many open points regarding their growth and stability. We introduce an in situ UV resonance Raman approach for real-time monitoring of the growth of carbon atomic wires during pulsed laser ablation in liquid without perturbing the synthesis environment. We track single-chain species' growth dynamics, achieving size selectivity by exploiting the peculiar optoelectronic properties of carbon wires and the tunability of synchrotron radiation. We systematically explore diverse solvents, finding size- and solvent-dependent production rates linked to the solvent's C/H ratio and carbonization tendency. Carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics reveal a complex interplay between formation and degradation, leading to an equilibrium. Water, lacking in carbon atoms and reduced polyynes' solubility, yields fewer wires with rapid saturation. Organic solvents exhibit enhanced productivity and near-linear growth, attributed to additional carbon from solvent dissociation and low relative polarity. Exploring the dynamics of the saturation regime provides new insights into advancing carbon atomic wires' synthesis via PLAL. Understanding carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics can contribute to optimizing PLAL processes for nanomaterial synthesis.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06197v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Defect migration and phase transformations in 2D iron chloride inside bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intercalation of metal chlorides, and particularly iron chlorides, into graphitic carbon structures has recently received lots of attention, as it can not only protect this two-dimensional (2D) magnetic system from the effects of the environment, but also substantially alter the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties of both intercalant and host material. At the same time, the intercalation can result in the formation of structural defects, or defects can appear under external stimuli, which can affect materials performance. These aspects have received so far little attention in the dedicated experiments. In this study, we investigate the behavior of atomic-scale defects in iron chlorides intercalated into bilayer graphene (BLG) by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations. We observe transformations between the FeCl2 and FeCl3 phases and elucidate the role of defects in the transformations. Specifically, three types of defects are identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl2 domains, Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl3 domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. We also observed a crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe5Cl18 which has not been reported before. Our findings not only advance the understanding of intercalation mechanism of 2D materials but also highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.</description>

      <title>scicode-widgets: Bringing Computational Experiments to the Classroom with Jupyter Widgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Computational experiments" use code and interactive visualizations to convey mathematical and physical concepts in an intuitive way, and are increasingly used to support ex cathedra lecturing in scientific and engineering disciplines. Jupyter notebooks are particularly well-suited to implement them, but involve large amounts of ancillary code to process data and generate illustrations, which can distract students from the core learning outcomes. For a more engaging learning experience that only exposes relevant code to students, allowing them to focus on the interplay between code, theory and physical insights, we developed scicode-widgets (released as scwidgets), a Python package to build Jupyter-based applications. The package facilitates the creation of interactive exercises and demonstrations for students in any discipline in science, technology and engineering. Students are asked to provide pedagogically meaningful contributions in terms of theoretical understanding, coding ability, and analytical skills. The library provides the tools to connect custom pre- and post-processing of students' code, which runs seamlessly "behind the scenes", with the ability to test and verify the solution, as well as to convert it into live interactive visualizations driven by Jupyter widgets.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Glassy Dynamics Theory for Predictive Polymer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion cells. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the solution in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a novel solver that accelerates the solution process and controls memory usage. Numerical experiments with realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed solver over existing solvers.</description>

However, current noise spectroscopies rely on severe approximations that sacrifice accuracy and precision. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. It self-consistently extracts noise spectra that characterize the interactions between a quantum sensor and its environment from commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude. Our method uncovers previously hidden structure with unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acidic medium</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HE effects, we synthesized 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, {\delta}-ZrH1.6, {\epsilon}-ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH) , using bulk metal foils as precursors and sulfuric/oleic acid as hydrogen donors. Through high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, the physical critical pressure ({\Delta}Pph) and equivalent pressure ({\Delta}Peq) concept were introduced to elucidate the mechanisms of the synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides. Quantitative analysis of 18 metal hydrides establishes that the criterion |{\Delta}Peq| &gt; {\Delta}Pph governs HE-driven hydride synthesis. Conversely, when |{\Delta}Peq| &lt; {\Delta}Pph , hydrogen-induced brittle fracture initiates. This mechanism enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides (LiH) while concurrently explaining failure modes in metals such as Fe. Our approach successfully converts HE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the hyperpolarization sample volume of an automated hydrogenative parahydrogen-induced polarizer</title>

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suffer from inherently low sensitivity due to the weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a powerful route to enhance NMR signals by several orders of magnitude, enabling real-time metabolic imaging. However, PHIP implementations are often constrained by small sample volumes, limited automation, and complex high-pressure requirements. In this work, we present an upgraded, automated PHIP system capable of hyperpolarizing sample volumes of up to 2.2 mL, making it suitable for preclinical MRI applications. We developed several high-pressure reactors and multi-port NMR tube caps compatible with standard commercial 5, 10, and 16 mm glass tubes. Reactor designs were simulated and fabricated from chemically resistant polymers, ensuring mechanical safety at more than 30 bar. Using FLASH MRI, nutation, and CPMG sequences, we characterized magnetic field homogeneity and stability, establishing optimal sample dimensions (12.5/16 mm ID/OD glass tube, 20 mm height) with B0 inhomogeneity below 2.5 ppm and B1 inhomogeneity around 1%. A high level of injection reproducibility was confirmed (volume precision ~0.6%). Optimization of experimental parameters, including hydrogenation pressure, pH2 flow rate, and sample temperature, enabled rapid and efficient polarization transfer. At optimized conditions (20 bar pH2, 2 L/min flow, 55{\deg}C, 4 s bubbling time), up to 31.3% 1H polarization of two protons was achieved for deuterated ethyl acetate in acetone with the theoretical maximum of 50%. This level of polarization was achieved with a duty cycle of 80 s, and the standard deviation of the mean was below 6.8%.</description>
