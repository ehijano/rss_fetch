      <title>Impact of Outreach on Physics Student Development: Quantitative Results from a National Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports on results from the first national study of the impact of student facilitation of informal physics outreach programs on their physics identity, sense of belonging, and essential career skill development. Drawing on results from studies at a single institution with a well-developed physics outreach program, a national survey was developed and distributed through the Society of Physics Students' network to more than five thousand individuals. Responses to closed-form questions on the survey were analyzed descriptively and using multiple regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between student participation in informal physics outreach programs and the constructs of interest. Results show a strong association between students engaging in outreach with their confidence in communicating their physics knowledge, the development of key career skills, and direct connections with growth mindset and sense of belonging. These results may be useful to physics and other STEM departments around the United States who are seeking to elevate and broaden the learning experience of students.</description>

      <title>The Reciprocal Velocity Force of a Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the course of their studies, students of physics accumulate experience in solving problems for a variety forces, not only developing a strong physical intuition for each force but also having an understanding of how each force is realized in the physical world. With this in mind we believe not enough emphasis is placed on the reciprocal velocity force $F(v)=\frac{C}{v}$. The theoretical importance of this force is illustrated by the units of the constant $C$ which are power. Such a force has constant power as $P(t)=F(v(t))v(t)=C$. The goal of this paper is to use graphical methods to explain how such a peculiar force arises from a device called a transmission, to explore some of the consequences of this force, and to briefly discuss its role in automotive physics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of entanglement generation by elastic collision to realise the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</description>

      <title>AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force: Final report and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In March of 2024 the AAS formed our Graduate Admissions Task Force (GATF), asking us to produce recommendations aimed at improving the state of graduate admissions in astronomy. The task was a timely one, as the past decade has seen dramatic shifts that are currently being exacerbated by rapidly-shifting funding and policy challenges. The GATF surveyed recent applicants to astronomy graduate school and admissions leaders in degree-granting graduate programs, held in-depth conversations with select programs, and explored how other fields approach admissions. Based on this work, we have quantified recent changes in the astronomy graduate admissions landscape, addressed mismatches between perception and reality, and identified several key ways to address some of our current challenges. In this report we summarize the results of this work and the four main recommendations we believe the AAS should take to make lasting positive changes. We emphasize that the goal of our report, and the GATF's work, is not to help programs select students, or to help applicants get into graduate school. Instead, we have focused on ways to make the admissions process itself more streamlined, fair, and efficient for everyone involved.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm demystified for cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</description>
