      <title>A universal tale of determinants and Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965 Buchberger defined Gr\"obner bases and an algorithm to compute them. Despite a slow start, already in the eighties Gr\"obner bases had become the main device for symbolic computations involving polynomials as well as a theoretical tool for the investigation of ideals and varieties via the so-called Gr\"obner deformation techniques. Rings and algebraic varieties defined by means of determinants are among the most classical objects in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and invariant theory. By the end of the the eighties the time was ripe for the computation of Gr\"obner bases of determinantal ideals. We will tell the tale of how (universal) Gr\"obner bases of determinantal ideals were identified and the key role played by Bernd Sturmfels and his collaborators in this enterprise.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes with many facets are vertex decomposable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be a pure simplicial complex on $n$ vertices having dimension $d$ and codimension $c = n-d-1$ in the simplex. Terai and Yoshida proved that if the number of facets of $\Delta$ is at least $\binom{n}{c}-2c+1$, then $\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay. We improve this result by showing that these hypotheses imply the stronger condition that $\Delta$ is vertex decomposable. We give examples to show that this bound is optimal, and that the conclusion cannot be strengthened to the class of matroids or shifted complexes. We explore an application to Simon's Conjecture and discuss connections to other results from the literature.</description>

      <title>A formalism of $F$-modules for rings with complete local finite $F$-representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formalism of unit $F$-modules in the style of Lyubeznik and Emerton-Kisin for rings which have finite $F$-representation type after localization and completion at every prime ideal. As applications, we show that if $R$ is such a ring then the iterated local cohomology modules $H^{n_1}_{I_1} \circ \cdots \circ H^{n_s}_{I_s}(R)$ have finitely many associated primes, and that all local cohomology modules $H^n_I(R / gR)$ have closed support when $g$ is a nonzerodivisor on $R$.</description>

      <title>On Lengths of $\mathbb{F}_2[x,y,z]/(x^{d_1}, y^{d_2},z^{d_3}, x+y+z)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a formula for the vector space dimension of the ring $\mathbb{F}_2[x,y,z]/(x^{d_1}, y^{d_2},z^{d_3}, x+y+z)$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ when $d_1,d_2,d_3$ all lie between successive powers of $2$. For general $d_1,d_2,d_3$, we provide a simple algorithm to calculate the vector space dimension of $\mathbb{F}_2[x,y,z]/(x^{d_1}, y^{d_2},z^{d_3}, x+y+z)$ by combining our formula with certain results of Chungsim Han (1992).</description>

      <title>Homological and homotopical aspects of Gorenstein flat modules and complexes relative to duality pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological and homotopical aspects of Gorenstein flat modules over a ring with respect to a duality pair $(\mathcal{L,A})$. These modules are defined as cycles of exact chain complexes with components in $\mathcal{L}$ which remain exact after tensoring by objects in $\mathcal{A} \cap {}^\perp\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A} \cap \Big( \bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt; 0}} {\rm Ker}({\rm Ext}^i_{R^{\rm o}}(-,\mathcal{A})) \Big)$. In the case where $(\mathcal{L,A})$ is product closed and bicomplete (meaning in addition that $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under extensions, (co)products, $R \in \mathcal{L}$, $(\mathcal{A,L})$ is also a duality pair, and $\mathcal{A}$ is the right half of a hereditary complete cotorsion pair) we prove that these relative Gorenstein flat modules are closed under extensions, and that the corresponding Gorenstein flat dimension is well behaved in the sense that it recovers many of the properties and characterizations of its (absolute) Gorenstein flat counterpart (for instance, it can be described in terms of torsion functors). The latter in turn is a consequence of a Pontryagin duality relation that we show between these relative Gorenstein flat modules and certain Gorenstein injective modules relative to $\mathcal{A}$. We also find several hereditary and cofibrantly generated abelian model structures from these Gorenstein flat modules and complexes relative to $(\mathcal{L,A})$. At the level of chain complexes, we find three recollements between the homotopy categories of these model structures, along with several derived adjunctions connecting these recollements.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Problem in Galois Theory about the Roots of Irreducible Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $K$, and a root $\alpha$ of an irreducible polynomial over $K$ (in some algebraic closure) the number of roots of $f(x)$ lying in $K(\alpha)$ is studied here. Given such an $f(x)$ of degree $n$ for which $r$ of the roots are i n $K(\alpha)$, we describe a construction that yields, for $d\ge2$, irreducible polynomials of degree $nd$ and with exactly $rd$ of the roots in the field generated by any one root of those polynomials. Our results are valid for all number fields and possibly some more perfect fields. As an application, for $K=Q$ and positive integers $n\ge3,d\ge2$, we provide irreducible polynomials of degree $nd$ with exactly $d$ roots in the field generated by one of the roots. Independently, for $k&lt;n$, we construct irreducible polynomials over the rationals of degree $n!/(n-k)!$ for which the field generated by one root contains exactly $k!$ roots. Many interesting new questions for further research are provided.</description>
