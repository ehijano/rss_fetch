      <title>Turkey's Earthquakes: Damage Prediction and Feature Significance Using A Multivariate Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate damage prediction is crucial for disaster preparedness and response strategies, particularly given the frequent earthquakes in Turkey. Utilizing datasets on earthquake data, infrastructural quality metrics, and contemporary socioeconomic factors, we tested various machine-learning architectures to forecast death tolls and fatalities per affected population. Our findings indicate that the Random Forest model provides the most reliable predictions. The model highlights earthquake magnitude and building stability as the primary determinants of damage. This research contributes to the reduction of fatalities in future seismic events in Turkey.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Land Model Reveals Global Environmental Controls on Ecological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of terrestrial carbon and water exchange requires robust ecological parameters that capture vegetation responses and adaptations to the local environment. The current generation of land models use Plant Functional Types (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse categorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate, soil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant adaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth observations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing environments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a differentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the spatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with environmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our model unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with process-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions and their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less than half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon fluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely driven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned environment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at unseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics, and agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying parameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global carbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding of local responses of ecosystems to environmental drivers.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of sun-induced plant fluorescence in the O$_2$-A absorption band from DESIS imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first method allowing to retrieve spaceborne SIF maps at 30 m ground resolution with a strong correlation ($r^2=0.6$) to high-quality airborne estimates of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). SIF estimates can provide explanatory information for many tasks related to agricultural management and physiological studies. While SIF products from airborne platforms are accurate and spatially well resolved, the data acquisition of such products remains science-oriented and limited to temporally constrained campaigns. Spaceborne SIF products on the other hand are available globally with often sufficient revisit times. However, the spatial resolution of spaceborne SIF products is too small for agricultural applications. In view of ESA's upcoming FLEX mission we develop a method for SIF retrieval in the O$_2$-A band of hyperspectral DESIS imagery to provide first insights for spaceborne SIF retrieval at high spatial resolution. To this end, we train a simulation-based self-supervised network with a novel perturbation based regularizer and test performance improvements under additional supervised regularization of atmospheric variable prediction. In a validation study with corresponding HyPlant derived SIF estimates at 740 nm we find that our model reaches a mean absolute difference of 0.78 mW / nm / sr / m$^2$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Global Simulation of Nonlocal Gravity Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>
