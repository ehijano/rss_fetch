      <title>Despite Absolute Information Advantages, All Investors Incur Welfare Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into financial markets that incorporate a novel form of heterogeneity among investors, specifically in terms of their beliefs regarding the reliability of signals in the business cycle economy model, which may be biased. Unlike most papers in this field, we not only analyze the equilibrium but also examine welfare using objective measures while investors aim to maximize their utility based on subjective measures. Furthermore, we introduce passive investors and use their utility as a benchmark, thereby revealing the phenomenon of double loss sometimes. In the analysis, we examine two effects: the distortion effect on total welfare and the advantage effect of information and highlight their key factors of influence, with a particular emphasis on the proportion of investors. We also demonstrate that manipulating investors' estimation towards the economy can be a way to improve utility and identify an inner connection between welfare and survival.</description>

      <title>Optimal information acquisition for eliminating estimation risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper diverges from previous literature by considering the utility maximization problem in the context of investors having the freedom to actively acquire additional information to mitigate estimation risk. We derive closed-form value functions using CARA and CRRA utility functions and establish a criterion for valuing extra information through certainty equivalence, while also formulating its associated acquisition cost. By strategically employing variational methods, we explore the optimal acquisition of information, taking into account the trade-off between its value and cost. Our findings indicate that acquiring earlier information holds greater worth in eliminating estimation risk and achieving higher utility. Furthermore, we observe that investors with lower risk aversion are more inclined to pursue information acquisition.</description>

      <title>The Unfairness of $\varepsilon$-Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in decision-making processes is often quantified using probabilistic metrics. However, these metrics may not fully capture the real-world consequences of unfairness. In this article, we adopt a utility-based approach to more accurately measure the real-world impacts of decision-making process. In particular, we show that if the concept of $\varepsilon$-fairness is employed, it can possibly lead to outcomes that are maximally unfair in the real-world context. Additionally, we address the common issue of unavailable data on false negatives by proposing a reduced setting that still captures essential fairness considerations. We illustrate our findings with two real-world examples: college admissions and credit risk assessment. Our analysis reveals that while traditional probability-based evaluations might suggest fairness, a utility-based approach uncovers the necessary actions to truly achieve equality. For instance, in the college admission case, we find that enhancing completion rates is crucial for ensuring fairness. Summarizing, this paper highlights the importance of considering the real-world context when evaluating fairness.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time algorithm for optimal stopping with fixed accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.02227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of high-dimensional path-dependent optimal stopping (OS) is important to multiple academic communities and applications. Modern OS tasks often have a large number of decision epochs, and complicated non-Markovian dynamics, making them especially challenging. Standard approaches, often relying on ADP, duality, deep learning and other heuristics, have shown strong empirical performance, yet have limited rigorous guarantees (which may scale exponentially in the problem parameters and/or require previous knowledge of basis functions or additional continuity assumptions). Although past work has placed these problems in the framework of computational complexity and polynomial-time approximability, those analyses were limited to simple one-dimensional problems. For long-horizon complex OS problems, is a polynomial time solution even theoretically possible? We prove that given access to an efficient simulator of the underlying information process, and fixed accuracy epsilon, there exists an algorithm that returns an epsilon-optimal solution (both stopping policies and approximate optimal values) with computational complexity scaling polynomially in the time horizon and underlying dimension. Like the first polynomial-time (approximation) algorithms for several other well-studied problems, our theoretical guarantees are polynomial yet impractical. Our approach is based on a novel expansion for the optimal value which may be of independent interest.</description>
