      <title>Thermodynamic characteristics of two horizons coexistence region in 4D-EGB spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of the coexistence region of two horizons in the charged 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) spacetime. Initially, we apply the universal first law of thermodynamics to derive the corresponding thermodynamic quantities for the coexistence region between the black hole event horizon and the cosmological event horizon, subject to the relevant boundary conditions. Next we examine the thermal properties of the thermodynamic system described by these equivalent quantities. Our analysis reveals that the peak of the heat capacity as a function of temperature exhibits characteristics similar to those observed in a paramagnetic system under specific conditions. We further conclude that, under certain conditions, the heat capacity mirrors that of a two-level system formed by two horizons with distinct temperatures. By comparing the heat capacity of the 4D-EGB spacetime's equivalent thermodynamic system with that of a two-level system defined by the two horizons in the spacetime, we can estimate the number of microscopic degrees of freedom at the two horizons. This findings sheds light on the quantum properties of de Sitter (dS) spacetime with two horizon interfaces and offers a novel approach to exploring the quantum properties of black holes and dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Thick braneworld in $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a codimension-one thick brane within the framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $Q$ is the nonmetricity scalar and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using two specific choices of the warp factor, we construct the complete brane system, including the scalar field solution and energy density. We show how nonmetricity influences the brane profile and analyze the stability of the braneworld scenarios under small tensor perturbations.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations which represents a rotating black hole with both electric and magnetic charges immersed in a universe which itself is also rotating and magnetized, i.e. the dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe. We show that the solution is completely regular and free of any type of singularity; then we analyze its physical properties, such as the ergoregions and the shape of the event horizons. Finally we present the extremal near horizon geometry of the metric and study its entropy via the Kerr/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>A directed continuous-wave search from Scorpius X-1 with the five-vector resampling technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs), which are typically emitted by rapidly rotating neutron stars with non-axisymmetric deformations, represent particularly intriguing targets for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. These detectors operate within sensitivity bands that encompass more than half of the known pulsars in our galaxy existing in binary systems (i.e., over 417 pulsars), which are the targeted sources of this paper. However, the detection of these faint signals is especially challenged by the Doppler modulation due to the source's orbital motion, typically described by five Keplerian parameters, which must be determined with high precision to effectively detect the signal. This modulation spreads the signal across multiple frequency bins, resulting in a notable reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and potentially hindering signal detection. To overcome this issue, a robust five-vector resampling data-analysis algorithm has been developed to conduct thorough directed/narrowband CW searches at an affordable computational cost. We employ this methodology for the first time to search for CWs from Scorpius X-1, using publicly available data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. No statistically significant CW signals can be claimed. Hence, we proceeded setting 95% confidence-level upper limits in selected frequency bands and orbital parameter ranges, while also evaluating overall sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of plasma densities and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a periodic distortion in the photon ring morphology, with the periodicity aligning with that of the dilaton-driven plasma frequency oscillations. We then assess the magnitude of this effect under the current angular resolution constraints of VLBI observations. Our analysis indicates that a comprehensive search for superradiant dilaton clouds based on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling would necessitate radio interferometric baselines significantly exceeding the Earth's diameter to resolve the corresponding signatures.</description>

      <title>Multi-detector characterization of gravitational-wave burst tensor polarizations with the BayesWave algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that gravitational waves (GWs) are tensor-polarized, with two modes of polarization: plus ($h_+$) and cross ($h_\times$). The unmodeled GW burst analysis pipeline, \textit{BayesWave}, offers two tensor-polarized signal models: the elliptical polarization model ($E$) and the relaxed polarization model ($R$). Future expansion of the global GW detector network will enable more accurate studies of GW polarizations with GW bursts. Here a multi-detector analysis is conducted to compare the performance of $E$ and $R$ in characterizing elliptical and nonelliptical GW polarizations, using nonprecessing and precessing binary black holes (BBHs) respectively as representative synthetic sources. It is found that both models reconstruct the elliptical nonprecessing BBH signals accurately, but $E$ has a higher Bayesian evidence than $R$ as it is has fewer model parameters. The same is true for precessing BBHs that are reconstructed equally well by both models. However, for some events with high precession and especially with three or more detectors, the reconstruction accuracy and evidence of $R$ surpass $E$. The analysis is repeated for BBH events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run, and the results show that $E$ is preferred over $R$ for existing detections. Although $E$ is generally preferred for its simplicity, it insists on elliptical polarizations, whereas $R$ can measure generic GW polarization content in terms of Stokes parameters. The accuracy of $R$ in recovering polarization content improves as the detector network expands, and the performance is independent of the GW signal morphology.</description>

      <title>Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of equivalent representations of gravity are discussed in the metric-affine framework. First, we focus on: (i) General Relativity, based upon the metric tensor whose dynamics is given by the Ricci curvature scalar $R$; (ii) the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, based on tetrads and spin connection whose dynamics is given by the torsion scalar $T$; (iii) the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, formulated with respect to both the metric tensor and the affine connection and characterized by the non-metric scalar $Q$ with the role of gravitational field. They represent the so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity, because, even if based on different frameworks and different dynamical variables, such as curvature, torsion, and non-metricity, they express the same gravitational dynamics. Starting from this framework, we construct their extensions with the aim to study possible equivalence. We discuss the straightforward extension of General Relativity, the $f(R)$ gravity, where $f(R)$ is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. With this paradigm in mind, we take into account $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ extensions showing that they are not equivalent to $f(R)$. Dynamical equivalence is achieved if boundary terms are considered, that is $f(T-\tilde{B})$ and $f(Q-B)$ theories. The latter are the extensions of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity and Symmetric Teleparallel of General Relativity, respectively. We obtain that $f(R)$, $f(T-\tilde{B})$, and $f(Q-B)$ form the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity. The aim is to show that also if dynamics are equivalent, foundations of theories of gravity can be very different.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Modified Entropic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account the temperature corrections of the energy equipartition law for the bits of information that are coarse-grained on the holographic screen leads to a modification of Einstein's gravitational field equations. In the very high-temperature limit, which corresponds to strong gravitational fields, the modified gravitational equations reduce to the standard Einstein equations of general relativity, but in the low-temperature limit, which corresponds to the weak gravity regime, the modified equations show significant deviations from the standard Einstein equations. We solve the modified Einstein equations for the FRW metric and obtain the modified Friedmann equations. We see that the Friedmann equations obtained with this approach agree with the Friedmann equations previously obtained from the thermodynamic corrections of classical Newtonian mechanics. Using the modified Friedmann equations for a flat universe, we investigate the implications of our modified entropic cosmology (MEC) model. We show that our model can explain the dynamics of the universe without requiring any kind of dark energy. Using the Pantheon supernovae dataset, BAO data, Planck 2018 CMB data, and SH0ES measurements for $H_0$, we test the MEC model against observations. We will see that MEC fits the observational data better than the standard cosmological model of $\Lambda$CDM. We also see that our model can successfully solve the $H_0$ tension that challenges the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Polar perturbations in Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes and hybrid quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing attention has been recently devoted to the study of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime as a way to explore the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. In this work, we construct a Hamiltonian formulation for polar perturbations of this spacetime in the presence of a perturbative massless scalar field. Our analysis is based on a truncated action at quadratic order in perturbations. Both background and perturbative degrees of freedom are treated dynamically, forming a combined system that is endowed with the canonical structure obtained from our truncated action. First-order perturbations of the metric and the matter field are described using perturbative gauge-invariants, linear perturbative constraints, and their corresponding canonical variables. For the quantum description, we adopt a hybrid approach where the background is quantized with loop quantum gravity techniques, and the perturbations with conventional quantum field methods.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonlinear electrodynamics on polarization distribution around black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the polarized images of synchrotron emission from magnetically charged, spherically symmetric regular Bronnikov black hole (in general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics) and the singular Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole (in general relativity coupled to Maxwell electrodynamics). By taking into account the fact that within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics, the propagation of the light ray is governed not by the null geodesics of the original spacetime, but rather by the null geodesics associated with the effective metric, we have examined synchrotron radiation characteristics near these black holes at different inclination angles. Our calculations reveal that intensity differences between these two black holes are significant, especially at high values of magnetic charges and large tilt angles. Polarization quantities, such as the electric vector polarization angle ($\Delta$EVPA) and normalized intensity difference ($\Delta I/I$) show similar trends, driven by lensing, Doppler effects, and redshift, offering insights into black hole metrics.</description>

      <title>Extraction of energy from a black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been discovered that the nonlinear self-interaction of matter can induce energy extraction from black holes beyond superradiant instability. This process is closely associated with the occurrence of a dynamical first-order transition between different types of static black holes. To explore whether first-order phase transitions invariably lead to energy extraction, we have investigated the evolution of black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model with a higher-order coupling. In this model, there are also dynamical first-order phase transitions between black hole solutions. Our findings indicate that energy can only be extracted from a small, stable hairy black hole in this model. However, this energy extraction is more closely related to the growth of the black hole horizon radius, rather than the dynamical transition between different types of black holes. This suggests that a dynamical first-order phase transition does not necessarily result in energy extraction.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing Effect and Quasinormal Modes of Oscillations of Black Holes in $\boldsymbol{f(R,T)}$ Gravity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the strong lensing phenomenon and quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the case of black holes (BHs) surrounded by fluids within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity, adopting a minimally coupled model of the theory. Our analysis is conducted for three surrounding fields corresponding to three different values of the parameter $\omega$ of the equations of state, each representing a unique class of BH solutions. A universal method developed by V.~Bozza is employed for strong lensing analysis and the WKB approximation method to compute the QNMs of oscillation of the BHs. The influence of the model parameter $\beta$ on the deflection angle and associated lensing coefficients is analyzed. Our findings on lensing reveal that smaller values of $\beta$ cause photon divergence at larger impact parameters, with the results converging to the Schwarzschild limit as $\beta\to -16.7551$ for (for $\omega=0)$, $\beta\to -18.8495$ (for $\omega=1/3)$ and $\beta\to -13.7088$ (for $\omega=-2/3)$. Extending the analysis to the supermassive BH SgrA*, we examine the outermost Einstein rings, estimate three lensing observables: angular position $\vartheta_{\infty}$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_\text{mag}$ for the BHs. For a specific value of $\beta$, BHs with different field configurations exhibit substantial variations in their observable properties. The variation of amplitude and damping of QNMs with respect to the model parameter $\beta$ is analyzed for the BHs. We found that the $\beta$ parameter has a direct correlation with the amplitude and an inverse relation with the damping of the QNMs. Further, we use the time domain analysis to verify the results and found a good match between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk around Schwarzschild-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and optical appearance of electromagnetic radiation emitted from a thin accretion disk surrounding a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH), within the framework of bumblebee gravity. This research explores the impact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter on various aspects of the disk, including its energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. By deriving and analyzing both direct and secondary images, we examine how the observational inclination angle and the LSB parameter affect these properties. We calculate and plot the distributions of both redshift and observed flux as seen by distant observers at different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the observable properties of a BH are influenced not only by the geometry of the accretion disk but also by its spatiotemporal attributes and the observer's inclination angle.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Weak Gravity Conjecture via Leading-Order Quantum Gravity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. As a proof of the weak gravity conjecture, we show that these quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes. It is important to note that our results are model-independent and have predictive capacities.</description>

      <title>Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Focusing on different relativistic dark matter distributions with an inner density spike, we analyze the effect of the dark matter halo on the topology and properties of the accretion flow. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution. Since the dominant contribution to the disk luminosity for compact and massive halo comes from the inner region of the accretion disk, our analysis suggests that luminosity measurement can indeed be useful to probe the exact nature of the dark matter density spike.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolutions of the linearised conformal Einstein field equations in the inversion-Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical evolutions of a system of equations close to null infinity in the geometric background of the inversion-Minkowski spacetime are performed. The evolved equations correspond to the linearisation of a second order metric formulation of the conformal Einstein field equations (CEFEs). These linear equations were first presented in [1] and the main purpose of this paper is to illustrate, through numerical evolutions, the scri-fixing technique via gauge source functions introduced [1] for the linearised CEFEs. A comparison of evolutions using scri-fixing gauge sources and trivial gauge source function in spherical and axial symmetry is presented.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generalised axion-like potentials for the late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hubble constant using standard sirens and reconstructed matter density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarise a new approach for measuring the Hubble constant using standard sirens and the reconstructed matter density field obtained from observed galaxy surveys. Specifically, we describe and test this method using the Bayesian forward-modelled software BORG. This software evolves the initial density field to the present, sampling plausible density fields from the posterior, accounting for peculiar velocities, and automatically incorporating higher-order correlation functions. The advantage of adding additional information from correlations is expected to make this method more effective in low-signal-to-noise regimes, such as those with modest galaxy number density or incomplete surveys. Our results show that developing a cross-correlation framework between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys, based on the forward-modelled reconstructed density field, to measure H0 is promising. This review is based on the research conducted as part of Boruah's Ph.D. thesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the anisotropic nature of the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. Using a numerical approach, we derive constraints on the intermediate parameter $\beta$ and the anisotropic parameter $c$. Our results show that the model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL, for $0.84&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.34&lt;c&lt;27.7$. At $95\%$ CL the consistency holds for $0.77&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.17&lt;c&lt;28.9$. The model is also consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK18+BAO data, for $0.91&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $8.00&lt;c&lt;27.4$ (at $68\%$ CL), and $0.88&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.40&lt;c&lt;28.8$ (at $95\%$ CL). Additionally, we examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $\beta$ and $c$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheating phase.</description>

      <title>Employing deep-learning techniques for the conservative-to-primitive recovery in binary neutron star simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817, together with its electromagnetic counterparts, has proven that binary neutron star mergers are of central importance to the field of nuclear astrophysics, e.g., through a better understanding of the formation of elements and novel constraints on the supranuclear dense equation of state governing the matter inside neutron stars. Essential for understanding the binary coalescence are numerical-relativity simulations, which typically come with high computational costs requiring high-performance computing facilities. In this work, we build on recent studies to investigate whether novel techniques, such as neural networks, can be employed in the conversion of conservative variables to primitive hydrodynamical variables, such as pressure and density. In this regard, we perform -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first binary neutron star merger simulations in which such methods are employed. We show that this method results in stable simulations, reaching accuracies similar to traditional methods with an overall comparable computational cost. These simulations serve as a proof of principle that, in the future, deep learning techniques could be used within numerical-relativity simulations. However, further improvements are necessary to offer a computational advantage compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Constructing noncommutative black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections to near-extremal entropy of charged de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole by computing a one-loop contribution within the path integral framework in the near-horizon limit. Due to the presence of three horizons, the extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is uniquely intriguing and remarkably different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations, each corresponding to a different product geometry structure involving AdS$_2$, dS$_2$ and Mink$_2$ respectively, where all of them contain a $S^2$. We compute the tensor zero modes of the Lichnerowicz operator acting on linearized metric perturbations for the cold and Nariai extremal limits which are associated with near-horizon AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ asymptotic symmetries. While the path integral over these zero modes results in an infrared divergence within the one-loop approximation to the partition function, we regulate the divergence by introducing a small, finite temperature perturbative correction to the extremal geometry.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogue models of black holes typically have collective excitations with a dispersion relation that breaks the effective Lorentz symmetry at high energy. We investigate the consequences of such Lorentz violations on the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system, that is, the modes of energy dissipation. The model involves low frequency capillary-gravity waves (whose dispersion relation can be adjusted between sub- and superluminal modifications) around a draining vortex, which mimics a rotating black hole spacetime. For a subluminal/superluminal modification, the frequency and decay rate of co-rotating modes can be reduced/increased substantially, whilst counter-rotating modes are barely affected. A further consequence of the superluminal modification is that there are no corotating QNMs above a critical rotation and no counter-rotating ones below a critical rotation for strong enough Lorentz violations.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Holography via Quantum Coherence on Causal Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12080v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is much recent development towards interferometric measurements of holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain power spectral density, the foundational insights of the motivating theories have not been connected to a phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This work proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is inspired by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time (conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are projected from Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program probing concordant signatures: An analysis of cosmological data to probe primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB anomalies as coherent fluctuations on the inflationary horizon, and upcoming 3D interferometers to probe causal diamonds in flat space-time. Candidate interferometer geometries are presented, with a modeled frequency spectrum for each design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the deformation of the Heisenberg algebra by a minimal length has become a central tool in quantum gravity phenomenology, it has never been rigorously obtained and is often derived using heuristic reasoning. In this study, we move beyond the heuristic derivation of the deformed Heisenberg algebra and explicitly derive it using a model of discrete spacetime, which is motivated by quantum gravity. Initially, we investigate the effects of the leading order Planckian lattice corrections and demonstrate that they precisely match those suggested by the heuristic arguments commonly used in quantum gravity phenomenology. Furthermore, we rigorously obtain deformations from the higher-order Planckian lattice corrections. In contrast to the leading-order corrections, these higher-order corrections are model dependent. We select a specific model that breaks the rotational symmetry, as the importance of such rotational symmetry breaking lies in the relationship between CMB anisotropies and quantum gravitational effects. Based on the mathematical similarity of the Planckian lattice used here with the graphene lattice, we propose that graphene can serve as an analogue system for the study of quantum gravity. Finally, we examine the deformation of the covariant form of the Heisenberg algebra using a four-dimensional Euclidean lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics are rigorously investigated through the systematic application of autonomous system analysis to the gravitational field equations in non-metricity gravity. The systematic procedure to analyze the late-time cosmic acceleration in higher-order non-metricity gravity is demonstrated by exploring non-hyperbolic critical points with the center manifold theory. The stability properties of these critical points are also evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits. It is explicitly shown that the stable node can be realized. The critical points of each model are individually analyzed, and their corresponding cosmological implications are derived. The stability properties of these critical points are evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits, revealing that each model includes at least one stable node. Furthermore, the evolution plots of the cosmological parameters confirm the models capacity to exhibit accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Fragmentation of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of $SU(\infty)$-QGR~has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify the impact of the degeneracies of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$ algebra on the construction of the model; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

      <title>On supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent papers, Fuentealba, Henneaux, and Troessaert (FHT) gave definitions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism and showed that their definitions match with the Chen, Wang, Yau (CWY) definitions of Lorentz charges at null infinity which are free from ``supertranslation ambiguities''. In this brief note, motivated by the analysis of FHT, we write expressions for the supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in Beig-Schmidt variables at spacelike and timelike infinity. We present calculations, building upon the work of Comp\`ere, Gralla, and Wei (CGW), to show that our expressions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges match the CWY definitions at null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective dynamics of loop quantum gravity for marginally bound Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes predict that the big-bang singularity is resolved and replaced by a cosmic bounce. Numerics show that these effective dynamics also homogenize small regions soon after the bounce when inhomogeneities before the bounce are sufficiently large. These homogeneous regions typically have a width of a few Planck lengths where relative perturbations in the energy density remain less than 15%. If the bounce is followed by an inflationary period, the homogeneous region can reach cosmic scales and the amplitude of relative perturbations can be suppressed to a value compatible with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the signatures of black holes within an effective quantum gravity framework recently proposed in the literature [1] . We begin by outlining the general setup, highlighting the two distinct models under consideration. This includes a discussion of their general properties, interpretations, and the structure of the event and inner horizons. We then examine the behavior of light in this context, analyzing geodesics, the photon sphere, and shadow formation. To validate our results, we estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius based on observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we derive the partial radial wave equation for scalar perturbations, enabling us to study the absorption cross section in both low and high frequency regimes. Additionally, we evaluate the greybody factors and provide bounds for both bosonic and fermionic fields. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of gravitational lensing in both the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection regime, the Gauss Bonnet theorem is employed, while for the strong deflection limit, the Tsukamoto approach is utilized.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic MOND theory, promising in reproducing cosmology as well as the MOND phenomenology in the low acceleration regime, was recently proposed. We present the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and relativistic perturbation equations of this theory in cosmological context. The PN equations are presented to 1PN order and perturbation equations are presented in fully-nonlinear and exact forms. The gauge issues are clarified. The 1PN equations and linear perturbation equations are presented without imposing temporal gauge conditions. We show that to 0PN order baryon perturbation grows faster in the MOND regime. The MOND field can be interpreted as a fluid with specific equation of state without anisotropic stress, and the Jeans criterion is derived for the MOND field.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing the ringdown signal of GW150914 using the F-statistic method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from a binary black hole merger provides valuable insights into the properties of the final black hole and serves as a critical test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A key aspect of this investigation is to determine whether the first overtone mode exists in real GW data, as its presence would offer significant implications for our understanding of general relativity under extreme conditions. To address this, we conducted a reanalysis of the ringdown signal from GW150914, using the newly proposed F-statistic method to search for the first overtone mode. Our results are consistent with those obtained through classical time-domain Bayesian inference, indicating that there is no evidence of the first overtone mode in the ringdown signal of GW150914. However, our results show the potentiality of utilizing the F-statistic methodology to unearth nuanced features within GW signals, thereby contributing novel insights into black hole properties.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degrees of freedom arise from the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

      <title>Methodology for constraining ultralight vector bosons with gravitational wave searches targeting merger remnant black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons are a hypothetical class of particles predicted under various extensions of Standard Model physics. As a result of the superradiance mechanism, we expect ultralight bosons, should they exist in certain mass ranges, to form macroscopic clouds around rotating black holes, so that we can probe their existence by looking for the long-transient gravitational wave emission produced by such clouds. In this paper, we propose a statistically robust framework for constraining the existence of ultralight vector bosons in the absence of detecting such a signal from searches targeting merger remnant black holes, effectively marginalizing over the uncertainties present in the properties of the target black holes. We also determine the impact of weak kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon and vector mass generation through a hidden Higgs mechanism on the constraining power of these searches. We find that individual follow-up searches, particularly with the next-generation gravitational wave detectors, can probe regions of parameter space for such models where robust constraints are still lacking.</description>

Abstract: Cartan $F(R)$ gravity introduces the equivalent scalar-tensor theory by extending the gravity sector. From the solution of the modified Cartan equation leads to the interaction with the scalar field and the fermion. We derived the effective potential of the scalar field using the auxiliary field method, which is commonly used in studies of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Using this effective potential we investigated the mass-radius relation of neutron star to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. By the numerical computation, we found that the contribution of the scalar field increases the mass of a neutron star. This could give theoretical plausibility to the current observations.</description>

      <title>The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in the hyperboloidal framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor types are thoroughly investigated and put into several typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega&lt;0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency-domain and time-domain, respectively. For the frequency-domain, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time-domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.</description>

Abstract: This report provides a geometrical Yang-Mills theory, including gravity. The theory treats the space-time symmetry of the local Lorentz group in the same manner as the internal gauge symmetry. We extend this general relativistic Yang-Mills theory in the Minkowski space-time to a broader space, including Euclidean and Minkowskian spaces. In the extended space, we can transport topological achievements from the Euclidean Yang-Mills theory into the Lorentzian Yang-Mills theory. This extension also provides a relation between space-time and internal symmetry. The perspective provided by the extended theory suggests the novel relation between gravity and the weak force, leading us to the graviweak correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak (EW) scale via non-perturbative dynamics of a conformally invariant scalar sector at the classical level. We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a scalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of its quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also show that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as, without it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a self-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model building with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in general, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the visible sector or the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short $\gamma$-ray bursts, as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole.

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

      <title>Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An approach to cosmological modelling is presented that incorporates the inhomogeneous structure of the Cosmic Web, specifically focusing on the interplay between cosmic voids and density walls. We extend the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to account for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By modifying the Friedmann equations to include inhomogeneity terms representing voids and walls, we develop a more realistic description of cosmic evolution. Our model demonstrates how the presence of these structures affects the overall expansion rate of the universe and the growth of perturbations. We find that accounting for this inhomogeneous distribution leads to significant deviations from the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the late-time universe. The Hubble and $\sigma_8$ structure growth tensions are addressed in the void-density wall model, leading to a resolution of these tensions. These results have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations when including the void and density wall Cosmic Web inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>BV description of $N = 1$, $D = 4$ Supergravity in the first order formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note examines the BV formulation of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the first-order Palatini--Cartan framework. Challenges in achieving an off-shell formulation are addressed by introducing corrections to the rank 2 BV action, offering in addition a solid foundation for the study of the theory on manifolds with boundary.</description>
