      <title>Conformal Blocks in Two and Four Dimensions from Oscillator Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit computation of higher-point conformal blocks in any dimension is usually a challenging task. For two-dimensional conformal field theories in Euclidean signature, the oscillator formalism proves to be very efficient. We demonstrate this by reproducing the general n-point global conformal block in the comb channel in an elegant and direct manner. Exploiting similarities to the representation theory of two-dimensional CFTs, we extend the oscillator formalism for the computation of higher-point conformal blocks in four Euclidean dimensions. As a proof of concept, we explicitly compute the scalar four-point block with scalar exchange within this framework.</description>

      <title>Moduli Spaces in CFT: Large Charge Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the large-charge expansion, we prove a necessary condition for a CFT to exhibit conformal symmetry breaking, under the assumption that a continuous global symmetry is ${\it also}$ broken on the moduli space: there must be a tower of charged local operators whose scaling dimensions are asymptotically linear in the charge. In supersymmetric theories with a continuous R-symmetry and a holomorphic moduli space, the existence of such a tower of operators follows trivially from a BPS condition: their scaling dimensions are then exactly linear in the R-charge. We illustrate the more general statement in several examples of three-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ CFTs, where the leading linear behavior receives nontrivial corrections. By considering a suitable scaling limit, we also relate the spectrum of states with large charge on the cylinder (isomorphic to local operators) to the spectrum of massive particles on the moduli space.</description>

      <title>The cosmological constant and the Gauss-Bonnet term in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper [1, 2], we proposed a probabilistic argument to explain the reason why the cosmological constant is very small in 4D. It is natural to ask if the result can be generalized to D-dimension. Moreover, in higher dimensional theory motivated by string theory the Gauss-Bonnet term plays an important role. Therefore, in this paper, we generalize our result to arbitrary D dimensions including the Gauss-Bonnet term. As a result, we have two main results. We find that the Euclidean action of the bounce, B, describing the decay of a de Sitter vacuum, is proportional to $\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}(D-2)}$, which has a pole as $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$ where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant of the parent vacuum. This result is similar to the result in 4D. The other result is that we find a new decay channel, describing up-tunnelling from anti-de Sitter into de Sitter. The meaning of this new decay channel in the string landscape should be explored in the future.</description>

      <title>Supergravity Component Reduction with Computer Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an interplay between superspace and component superconformal tensor calculus techniques, recently, the off-shell construction of the supersymmetric extension of the three independent curvature-squared invariants for minimal (N = 1) gauged supergravity in five dimensions (5D) was completed. A key ingredient in obtaining these results is the implementation of computer algebra algorithms. In this report, we describe how to use cadabra to systematically study component reduction from superspace with computer algebra in the case of 5D, N = 1 supergravity.</description>

      <title>The Casimir energy with perfect electromagnetic boundary conditions and duality: a field-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using functional integral methods, we study the Casimir effect for the case of two infinite parallel plates in the QED vacuum, with (different) perfect electromagnetic boundary conditions applied to both plates. To enforce these boundary conditions, we add two Lagrange multiplier fields to the action. We subsequently recover the known Casimir energy in two ways: once directly from the path integral, and once as the vacuum expectation value of the 00-component of the energy-momentum tensor. Comparing both methods, we show that the energy-momentum tensor must be modified, and that it picks up boundary contributions as a consequence. We also discuss electromagnetic duality-invariance of the theory and its interplay with the boundaries by generalizing the Deser-Teitelboim implementation of the duality transformation.</description>

      <title>Giant graviton expansion for general Wilson line operator indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a giant graviton expansion for Wilson line operator indices in general representations. The inserted line operators are specified by power sum symmetric polynomials $p_\lambda$ labeled by partitions $\lambda$. We interpret the partitions as the structure of fundamental string worldsheets wrapping around the temporal circle. The strings may or may not end on giant gravitons, and by summing the contributions from all brane configurations consistent with the specified partitions, we obtain the finite $N$ line operator index. The proposed formula is consistent with known results and passes highly non-trivial numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Duality constraints on thermal spectra of 3d CFTs and 4d quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N CFTs correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Unified worldline treatment of Yukawa and axial couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a worldline representation of the one-loop effective action for a Dirac particle coupled to external scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axialvector fields. Extending previous work by two of the authors on the pure vector-axialvector case to all four couplings, it allows one to treat the real and the imaginary parts of the effective action in a unified manner, at the price of having a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
  Unlike existing worldline representations, our new worldline action contains terms with an odd number of Grassmann fields, leading to ordering problems that in the worldline formalism are usually encountered only in curved space. Drawing on the highly developed technology for worldline path-integrals in gravity, we employ the Time Slicing regularisation of the path integral which comes about with a specific ``counterterm Lagrangian'', which we calculate once and for all and non-perturbatively, to provide unambiguous rules to treat products of distributions occurring in some diagrams of the one-dimensional worldline theory. We then employ the usual worldline machinery to lay out the rules for the calculation of the effective action itself as well as the corresponding one-loop amplitudes.
  We test the formalism on the calculation of various heat-kernel coefficients, self energies and scattering amplitudes, including the Higgs decay into two photons or gluons and the PCAC relation. In all cases we find perfect agreement with more established approaches.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach to the Bell-CHSH inequality in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is analyzed. Using Weyl operators built with smeared fields localized in the Rindler wedges, the Bell-CHSH inequality is expressed in terms of the Lorentz invariant inner products of test functions. A numerical framework for these inner products is devised. Causality is also explicitly checked by a numerical evaluation of the Pauli-Jordan function. Violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality are reported for different values of the particle mass parameter.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for representations of quiver Yangian algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we aim to review algorithms for constructing crystal representations of quiver Yangians in detail. Quiver Yangians are believed to describe an action of the BPS algebra on BPS states in systems of D-branes wrapping toric Calabi-Yau three-folds. Crystal modules of these algebras originate from molten crystal models for Donaldson-Thomas invariants of respective three-folds. Despite the fact that this subject was originally at the crossroads of algebraic geometry with effective supersymmetric field theories, equivariant toric action simplifies applied calculations drastically. So the sole pre-requisite for this algorithm's implementation is linear algebra. It can be easily taught to a machine with the help of any symbolic calculation system. Moreover, these algorithms may be generalized to toroidal and elliptic algebras and exploited in various numerical experiments with those algebras. We illustrate the work of the algorithms in applications to simple cases of $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1})$ and $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$.</description>

      <title>Maximal hypersurfaces and aspects of volume of the Kerr family of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15140v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Schwarzschild spacetime, Reinhart (1973) has shown the hypersurface $r_R = 3M/2$ (the subscript stands for "Reinhart") to be a maximal hypersurface. This Reinhart radius $r_R$ plays a crucial role in evaluating the interior volume of a black hole. In this article, we find such a maximal hypersurface for the Kerr and Kerr-Newaman black holes. We obtain the analytical expression for the Reinhart radius as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ for a small $a/M$ limit for both the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes. We obtain the Reinhart radius using two independent methods: a) the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature, and b) the variational method. We further use the Reinhart radius to obtain an analytical expression for the interior volume of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black hole in the small $a/M$ limit and a generic charge $Q$. We define $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ as the rate of change of the interior volume with respect to the ingoing null coordinate $v$ and then study its behavior under various scenarios, viz., particle accretion, the Penrose process, superradiance, and Hawking radiation. We show that while under the Penrose process and superradiance, the parameter $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ increases just as the area of a black hole but under particle accretion, $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ can have variable signs depending on the kinematical properties of the particle. We further probe into the behavior of $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ under Hawking radiation. These results provide important and very interesting clues toward the possible existence of laws governing the volume of black holes.</description>

      <title>Radiation from Dirac fermions caused by a projective measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of radiation of photons from Dirac particles caused by a projective measurement is developed. The explicit expressions for the inclusive probability to record a chain of events that the Dirac fermion had been measured in a certain state and after that the photon was recorded are derived. Stimulated and spontaneous radiations are considered. It is shown that in both cases the properties of radiation due to measurement resembles the properties of edge or transition radiation. In the case of stimulated radiation from a single particle, its wave function creates photons coherently as a charged fluid, i.e., the amplitudes of radiation from the points of the particle wave packet are summed. In the case of spontaneous radiation, the radiation of photons is incoherent, i.e., the probabilities of radiation from the points of the particle wave packet are added up. It is shown that stimulated radiation due to measurement can be used to trace the dynamics and collapse of the wave function of the Dirac particle. A systematic procedure taking into account a finiteness of the measurement time is presented. It is established that radiation due to measurement can be used as a source of hard photons, but the finiteness of the measurement time imposes an upper bound on the energy of radiated photons: the measurement time must be smaller than the radiation formation time, the latter being in inverse proportion to the photon energy. In the ultrarelativistic limit, the radiation formation time can be rather large. Several examples of radiation due to measurement of the state of free Dirac particles are investigated in detail. Namely, we scrutinize the radiation due to measurement of the spin projection, of the momentum, and of the coordinate for a general initial state of Dirac particles. The particular cases of uncorrelated and entangled particles in the beam are considered.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <title>$N$-bein formalism for the parameter space of quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Light deflection with torsion effects caused by a spinning cosmic string"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we showed that the line element ("metric'') worked by Jusufi (Eur. Phys. J. C 76: 332, 2016) is incorrect since he worked with a spinning cosmic string with torsion in $(2+1)$-dimensions (and in polar coordinates), which cannot happen. Indeed, as in $(2+1)$-dimensions there are no screw dislocations or screw torsion (a consequence of the absence of the third spatial dimension, i.e., of the $z$-axis), and being a cosmic string with torsion a type of screw dislocation, but of cosmic origin (i.e., are cosmic dislocations), implies that a $(2+1)$-dimensional cosmic string does not have/carry torsion (since $dz=0$). Therefore, the line element worked by Jusufi is physically incoherent/unacceptable and inappropriate for the research/study.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tensor Network Algorithms for Spin Foam Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical computations and methods have become increasingly crucial in the study of spin foam models across various regimes. This paper adds to this field by introducing new algorithms based on tensor network methods for computing amplitudes, focusing on topological SU(2) BF and Lorentzian EPRL spin foam models. By reorganizing the sums and tensors involved, vertex amplitudes are recast as a sequence of matrix contractions. This reorganization significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage, allowing for scalable and efficient computations of the amplitudes for larger representation labels on standard consumer hardware--previously infeasible due to the computational demands of high-valent tensors.
  We apply these tensor network algorithms to analyze the characteristics of various vertex configurations, including Regge and vector geometries for the SU(2) BF theory, demonstrating consistent scaling behavior and differing oscillation patterns. Our benchmarks reveal substantial improvements in computational time and memory allocations, especially for large representation labels. Additionally, these tensor network methods are applicable to generic 2-complexes with multiple vertices, where we introduce partial-coherent vertex amplitudes to streamline the computations. The implementation of these algorithms is available on GitHub for further exploration and use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a refined version of the string-net model which assigns a different energy cost to each plaquette excitation. Using recent exact calculations of the energy-level degeneracies we compute the partition function of this model and investigate several thermodynamical quantities. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that the partition function is dominated by the contribution of special particles, dubbed pure fluxons, which trivially braid with all other (product of) fluxons. We also analyze the behavior of Wegner-Wilson loops associated to excitations and show that they obey an area law, indicating confinement, for any finite temperature except for pure fluxons that always remain deconfined. Finally, using a recently proposed conjecture, we compute the topological mutual information at finite temperature, which features a nontrivial scaling between system size and temperature.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

Abstract: We consider noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain and construct eigenfunctions of $B$-element of monodromy matrix for the simplest case of the chain with one site. The reflection operator appearing in this construction can be used to express eigenfunction for $n$ sites in terms of the eigenfunction for $n-1$ sites, this general result is briefly announced. We prove orthogonality and completeness of constructed eigenfunctions in the case of one site, express them in terms of the hypergeometric function of the complex field and derive the equation for the reflection operator with the general $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-invariant $\mathbb{R}$-operator.</description>

      <title>Large quark mass Euler-Heisenberg type action for QCD with quark sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark determinant in the presence of a background gluon field is calculated in a large quark mass derivative expansion by considering quark sources. The resulting low-energy QCD Effective Field Theory (EFT) is valid for non-homogeneous fields and it presents, besides the usual Euler-Heisenberg type gluon self-interactions, different types of corrections to the minimal quark-gluon interaction among which there are several imaginary terms. The Abelian limit of this effective action, i.e. an expanded Euler-Heisenberg effective action with fermion sources, is exhibit and it contains, therefore, corrections to the fermion-photon interactions, including imaginary parts. Different resulting properties are calculated such as: their contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and its trace, the Poynting vector, the chromo-electric permittivity and chromo-magnetic permeability. Conditions for these quantities, as well as for the corresponding Abelian limits, to be real are exhibited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Dressing Field Method (DFM) in the context of Quantum (Gauge) Field Theories (QFT). In order to adapt this method to the functional path integral formalism of QFT, we depart from the usual differential geometry approach used so far to study the DFM which also allows to tackle the infinite dimension of the field spaces. Our main result is that gauge fixing is an instance of the application of the DFM. The Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing procedure and the so-called unitary gauge are revisited in light of this result.</description>

      <title>Enhanced induced gravitational waves in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study secondary gravitational wave production in Horndenski gravity, when the scalar field dominates the very early universe. We find that higher derivative interactions easily dominate the source term on subhorizon scales and significantly enhance the amplitude of induced GWs. We analytically derive, for the first time, the Horndeski induced GW spectrum for a general class of power-law solutions. The main effect of modifications of gravity are stronger resonances and a growth of tensor fluctuations on small scales. The maximum attainable amplitude of the induced GW spectrum is bounded by the possible backreaction of higher derivatives on curvature fluctuations, thereby shutting down the source term to induced GWs. We argue that the maximum attainable amplitude depends linearly on the primordial curvature spectrum ($\Omega_{\rm GW}\propto {\cal P}_\zeta$), as opposed to the standard case where it depends quadratically. Resonances may further enhance the maximum amplitude by a factor $(k/{\cal H}_t)^2$ or $(k/{\cal H}_t)$ respectively for sharp and broad peaks (including a scale invariant) primordial spectrum, where ${\cal H}_t$ is the comoving horizon at the time when standard gravity is recovered. Remarkably, in the scale invariant case, the Horndeski-induced GW spectrum grows as $k^3$. This opens up the interesting possibility that induced GWs might be observable despite no enhancement of the primordial curvature spectrum. Our formalism can be generalized to a wider class of solutions and to more general scalar-tensor theories, such as DHOST and spatially covariant gravity. In the appendices we provide discussions on the gauge issue and disformal transformations of induced GWs.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantum backreaction in U(1) axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum backreaction due to a gauge field coupled to a pseudo scalar field driving a slow-roll inflationary stage, the so-called axion inflation. The backreaction is evaluated for the first time using a gauge invariant approach, going to second order in perturbation theory and taking in consideration inflaton fluctuations as well as scalar perturbations of the metric. Within our gauge invariant, but observer-dependent approach, we naturally consider as physical observer the one comoving with the inflaton field. Considering the effective expansion rate consequent to the gauge fields bacreaction, we observe that the backreaction effect becomes significant quite rapidly, moving the system out of the perturbative regime and into what is often referred to the strong backreaction regime. This behavior also applies to the parameter which dictates the production of the gauge fields. The space-time dynamic is initially mainly influenced by the helicity contribution, with a significant response to the energy density which occurs much later with respect to the number of e-folds. As a final result, we see that the evaluated backreaction prolongs the inflationary period much more compared to the scenarios previously studied neglecting scalar metric perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the complexity equals any gravitational observable conjecture has been proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 081602 (2022)], which is an extension of the complexity equals volume proposal. These gravitational observables are referred to as generalized volumes. In this paper, we investigate the generalized volume-complexity for black holes with one or two horizons respectively. We verify that the turning time is universal and independent of the Cauchy horizon. Not only does this phase transition occur once, but it may also occur two or more times depending on the number and height of the effective potential peaks. On the other hand, we confirm that the generalized volume-complexity can be divided based on the shape of the effective potential. We then discuss the non-smooth transition from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black hole to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate, in the framework of the topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, using the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy, the topological numbers of the static multi-charge AdS black holes in four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravities. We find that the topological number of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (K-K) gauged supergravity theory is $W = 0$, while that of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional gauged $-iX^0X^1$-supergravity and STU gauged supergravity theories, and five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gauged supergravity and STU gauged supergravity, and five-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole are both $W = 1$. Furthermore, we observe a novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition that can happen in the four-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in EMDA gauged supergravity theory, the four-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole, and the five-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in K-K gauged supergravity theory. We believe that the novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition could help us better understand black hole thermodynamics and, further, shed new light on the fundamental nature of gauged supergravity theories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the surface growth scheme in AdS spacetime with a boundary in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may produce Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles even when the energy of electric fields is smaller than KK scale. As an illustrating example, we consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged Kaluza-Klein particle non-perturbatively, which we call KK Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion. We also discuss the subtlety of four dimensional effective theory truncated by KK modes at an initial time, when the electric field is turned on.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography for the de-Sitter space as a bulk theory. First, we discuss a more general mathematical construction of wedge holography in parallel with wedge holography construction for the AdS bulk, and then we construct the wedge holography in the extended static patch. In the first case, we prove that one can construct wedge holography for the de-Sitter bulk for the static patch as well as global coordinate metric on end-of-the-world branes. Extended static patch wedge holography is constructed by joining the two copies of double holography in DS/dS correspondence. We find that wedge holography with extended static patch metric leads to the emergence of communicating universes. Further, we propose a model which provides the theoretical evidence of communicating multiverses.</description>

Abstract: We study the confinement/deconfinement transition of QCD matter for a quark-gluon plasma at finite density using AdS/QCD duality. In order to determine the critical temperature and its dependence on the quark chemical potential, the semi-classical Hawking-Page approach is considered for a charged AdS black hole. The result obtained is consistent with the QCD phase diagram, with the critical temperature decreasing as the chemical potential increases. Using the soft wall holographic model, the value of quark density in which the phase transition occurs at zero temperature is estimated. For higher densities the QCD matter is deconfined, independent of the temperature.</description>

Abstract: Based on the D5-brane realization of Wilson line operators in anti-symmetric representations, we propose brane expansion formulas for $I_{N,k}$, the Schur index of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ SYM decorated by line operators in the anti-symmetric representation of rank $k$. For the large $N$ index $I_{\infty,k}$ we propose a double-sum expansion, and for finite $N$ index $I_{N,k}$ we propose a quadruple-sum expansion. Objects causing finite $k$ and finite $N$ corrections are disk D3-branes ending on the D5-brane.</description>

Abstract: We discuss non-relativistic variants of four-dimensional ${\cal N}$=4 super-Yang-Mills theory obtained from generalised Newton-Cartan geometric limits of D3-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime. We argue that the natural interpretation of these limits is that they correspond to non-relativistic D1-branes or D3-branes intersecting the original D3-branes. The resulting gauge theories have dynamics that reduce to quantum mechanics on monopole moduli space or two-dimensional sigma-models on Hitchin moduli space respectively. We show that these theories possess interesting infinite-dimensional symmetries and we discuss the dual $AdS$ geometries.</description>

Abstract: What can be measured by an observer in our universe? We address this question by constructing an algebra of gravitationally-dressed observables accessible to a comoving observer in FLRW spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the past, describing an inflationary epoch. An essential quantized degree of freedom is the zero-mode of the inflaton, which leads to fluctuations in the effective cosmological constant during inflation and prevents the existence of a maximum entropy state in the semiclassical limit. Due to the inaccessibility of measurements beyond our cosmological horizon, we demonstrate that all states are mixed with well-defined von Neumann entropy (up to a state-independent constant). For semiclassical states, the von Neumann entropy corresponds to the generalized entropy of the observer's causal diamond, a fine-grained quantity that is sensitive to the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04472</link>

Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are prototypical correlated systems with local constraints, which are not only intimately connected to lattice gauge theories and topological orders but are also widely applicable to the broad research areas of quantum materials and quantum simulation. Employing our sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we reveal the complete phase diagram of the triangular-lattice fully packed quantum loop model. Apart from the known lattice nematic (LN) solid and the even $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, we discover a hidden vison plaquette (VP) phase, which had been overlooked and misinterpreted as a QSL for more than a decade. Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O($3$) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.</description>

      <title>One loop to rule them all: Perturbativity in the presence of ultra slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the issue of perturbativity in single-field inflationary models with a phase of ultra slow-roll (USR) tailor suited to generate an order-one abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). More in detail, we impose the condition that loop corrections made up of short-wavelength modes enhanced by the USR dynamics do not alter the tree-level power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In our analysis, the USR phase is preceded and followed by two stages of ordinary slow-roll (SR), and we model the resulting SR/USR/SR dynamics using both instantaneous and smooth transitions. Focusing on scales relevant for CMB observations, we find that it is not possible, with these arguments, to rule out the scenario of PBH formation via USR, not even in the limit of instantaneous transition. However, we also find that loop corrections of short modes on the power spectrum of long modes, even though not large enough to violate perturbativity requirements, remain appreciable and, most importantly, are not tamed in realistic realisations of smooth SR/USR/SR transitions. This makes perturbativity a powerful theoretical tool to constrain USR dynamics. We extend the analysis at any scale beyond those relevant for CMB observations. We find that loop corrections of short modes remain within the few percent if compared to the tree-level power spectrum. However, we also find one notable exception of phenomenological relevance: we show that the so-called dip in the power spectrum of curvature perturbation is an artifact of the tree-level computation.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian generalizations of the Yao-Lee model augmented by SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-Hermitian versions of the Yao-Lee model, supplemented by various kinds of SO(3)-symmetry-breaking terms, preserving the solvability of the model. The parent model hosts three species of Majorana fermions, thereby serving as an extension of the two-dimensional Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice. The non-Hermitian couplings represent generic situations when the system is coupled to the environment and, thus, undergoes dissipation. The resulting eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenmodes show a rich structure of exceptional points as well as non-Hermitian skin effects. We chart out such exotic behaviour for some representative parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Markovian to non-Markovian phase transition in the operator dynamics of a mobile impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random unitary circuit model of an impurity moving through a chaotic medium. The exchange of information between the medium and impurity is controlled by varying the velocity of the impurity, $v_d$, relative to the speed of information propagation within the medium, $v_B$. Above supersonic velocities, $v_d&gt; v_B$, information cannot flow back to the impurity after it has moved into the medium, and the resulting dynamics are Markovian. Below supersonic velocities, $v_d&lt; v_B$, the dynamics of the impurity and medium are non-Markovian, and information is able to flow back onto the impurity. We show the two regimes are separated by a continuous phase transition with exponents directly related to the diffusive spreading of operators in the medium. This is demonstrated by monitoring an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in a scenario where the impurity is substituted at an intermediate time. During the Markovian phase, information from the medium cannot transfer onto the replaced impurity, manifesting in no significant operator development. Conversely, in the non-Markovian phase, we observe that operators acquire support on the newly introduced impurity. We also characterize the dynamics using the coherent information and provide two decoders which can efficiently probe the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian information flow. Our work demonstrates that Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics can be separated by a phase transition, and we propose an efficient protocol for observing this transition.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, truly collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: center-of-mass recoil effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For non-relativistic thermal dark matter, close-to-threshold effects largely dominate the evolution of the number density for most of the times after thermal freeze-out, and hence affect the cosmological relic density. A precise evaluation of the relevant interaction rates in a thermal medium representing the early universe includes accounting for the relative motion of the dark matter particles and the thermal medium. We consider a model of dark fermions interacting with a plasma of dark gauge bosons, which is equivalent to thermal QED. The temperature is taken to be smaller than the dark fermion mass and the inverse of the typical size of the dark fermion-antifermion bound states, which allows for the use of non-relativistic effective field theories. For the annihilation cross section, bound-state formation cross section, bound-state dissociation width and bound-state transition width of dark matter fermion-antifermion pairs, we compute the leading recoil effects in the reference frame of both the plasma and the center-of-mass of the fermion-antifermion pair. We explicitly verify the Lorentz transformations among these quantities. We evaluate the impact of the recoil corrections on the dark matter energy density. Our results can be directly applied to account for the relative motion of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. They may be also used to precisely assess thermal effects in atomic clocks based on atomic transitions; the present work provides a first field theory derivation of time dilation for these processes in vacuum and in a medium.</description>

      <title>Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.</description>
