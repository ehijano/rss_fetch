      <title>Minimalistic and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing Enhanced with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing only a few two-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurements. To achieve high computational expressivity with minimal hardware, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its hardware, while polynomial regression enhances output resolution by nonlinearly extending expressions. We evaluate QRC's memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant QRC performance with minimal reservoirs containing as few as five atoms, further enhanced by feedback mechanisms and polynomial regression. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

      <title>Reducing QUBO Density by Factoring Out Semi-Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Annealing are prominent approaches for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as those formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). These algorithms aim to minimize the objective function $x^T Q x$, where $Q$ is a QUBO matrix. However, the number of two-qubit CNOT gates in QAOA circuits and the complexity of problem embeddings in Quantum Annealing scale linearly with the number of non-zero couplings in $Q$, contributing to significant computational and error-related challenges. To address this, we introduce the concept of \textit{semi-symmetries} in QUBO matrices and propose an algorithm for identifying and factoring these symmetries into ancilla qubits. \textit{Semi-symmetries} frequently arise in optimization problems such as \textit{Maximum Clique}, \textit{Hamilton Cycles}, \textit{Graph Coloring}, and \textit{Graph Isomorphism}. We theoretically demonstrate that the modified QUBO matrix $Q_{\text{mod}}$ retains the same energy spectrum as the original $Q$. Experimental evaluations on the aforementioned problems show that our algorithm reduces the number of couplings and QAOA circuit depth by up to $45\%$. For Quantum Annealing, these reductions also lead to sparser problem embeddings, shorter qubit chains and better performance. This work highlights the utility of exploiting QUBO matrix structure to optimize quantum algorithms, advancing their scalability and practical applicability to real-world combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>Practical learning of multi-time statistics in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomised measurements can efficiently characterise many-body quantum states by learning the expectation values of observables with low Pauli weights. In this paper, we generalise the theoretical tools of classical shadow tomography to the temporal domain to explore multi-time phenomena. This enables us to efficiently learn the features of multi-time processes such as correlated error rates, multi-time non-Markovianity, and temporal entanglement. We test the efficacy of these tools on a noisy quantum processor to characterise its noise features. Implementing these tools requires mid-circuit instruments, typically slow or unavailable in current quantum hardware. We devise a protocol to achieve fast and reliable instruments such that these multi-time distributions can be learned to a high accuracy. This enables a compact matrix product operator representation of large processes allowing us to showcase a reconstructed 20-step process (whose naive dimensionality is that of a 42-qubit state). Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Correlated Noise Estimation with Quantum Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address the metrological problem of estimating collective stochastic properties of a many-body quantum system. Canonical examples include center-of-mass quadrature fluctuations in a system of bosonic modes and correlated dephasing in an ensemble of qubits (e.g., spins) or fermions. We develop a theoretical framework to determine the limits of correlated (weak) noise estimation with quantum sensor networks and unveil the requirements for entanglement advantage. Notably, an advantage emerges from the synergistic interplay between quantum correlations of the sensors and classical (spatial) correlations of the noises. We determine optimal entangled probe states and identify a sensing protocol, reminiscent of a many-body echo sequence, that achieves the fundamental limits of measurement sensitivity for a broad class of problems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable designs and design-based shadow tomography from random lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of lattice-like quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</description>

      <title>A dynamical algebra of protocol-induced transformations on Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum $n$-qubit states that are totally symmetric under the permutation of qubits are essential ingredients of important algorithms and applications in quantum information. Consequently, there is significant interest in developing methods to prepare and manipulate Dicke states, which form a basis for the subspace of fully symmetric states. Two simple protocols for transforming Dicke states are considered. An algebraic characterization of the operations that these protocols induce is obtained in terms of the Weyl algebra $W(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. Fixed points under the application of the combination of both protocols are explicitly determined. Connections with the binary Hamming scheme, the Hadamard transform, and Krawtchouk polynomials are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Case for Quantum Circuit Cutting for NISQ Applications: Impact of topology, determinism, and sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make the case that variational algorithm ansatzes for near-term quantum computing are well-suited for the quantum circuit cutting strategy. Previous demonstrations of circuit cutting focused on the exponential execution and postprocessing costs due to the cuts needed to partition a circuit topology, leading to overly pessimistic evaluations of the approach. This work observes that the ansatz Clifford structure and variational parameter pruning significantly reduce these costs. By keeping track of the limited set of correct subcircuit initializations and measurements, we reduce the number of experiments needed by up to 16x, matching and beating the error mitigation offered by classical shadows tomography. By performing reconstruction as a sparse tensor contraction, we scale the feasible ansatzes to over 200 qubits with six ansatz layers, beyond the capability of prior work.</description>

      <title>Device-Independent Randomness Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful realization of Bell tests has settled an 80-year-long debate, proving the existence of correlations which cannot be explained by a local realistic model. Recent experimental progress allowed to rule out any possible loopholes in these tests, and opened up the possibility of applications in cryptography envisaged more than three decades ago. A prominent example of such an application is device-independent quantum key distribution, which has recently been demonstrated. One remaining gap in all existing experiments, however, is that access to perfect randomness is assumed. To tackle this problem, the concept of randomness amplification has been introduced, allowing to generate such randomness from a weak source -- a task impossible in classical physics. In this work, we demonstrate the amplification of imperfect randomness coming from a physical source. It is achieved by building on two recent developments: The first is a theoretical protocol implementing the concept of randomness amplification within an experimentally realistic setup, which however requires a combination of the degree of Bell inequality violation (S-value) and the amount of data not attained previously. The second is experimental progress enabling the execution of a loophole-free Bell test with superconducting circuits, which offers a platform to reach the necessary combination. Our experiment marks an important step in achieving the theoretical physical limits of privacy and randomness generation.</description>

      <title>Approximating Ground States of Quantum Hamiltonians with Snapshot-QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Snapshot-QAOA, a variation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) that finds approximate minimum energy eigenstates of a large set of quantum Hamiltonians (i.e. Hamiltonians with non-diagonal terms). Traditionally, QAOA targets the task of approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems; Snapshot-QAOA enables a significant expansion of the use case space for QAOA to more general quantum Hamiltonians, where the goal is to approximate the ground-state. Such ground-state finding is a common challenge in quantum chemistry and material science applications. Snapshot-QAOA retains desirable variational-algorithm qualities of QAOA, in particular small parameter count and relatively shallow circuit depth. Snapshot-QAOA is thus a better trainable alternative to the NISQ-era Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, while retaining a significant circuit-depth advantage over the QEC-era Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm. Our fundamental approach is inspired by the idea of Trotterization of a continuous-time linear adiabatic anneal schedule, which for sufficiently large QAOA depth gives very good performance. Snapshot-QAOA restricts the QAOA evolution to not phasing out the mixing Hamiltonian completely at the end of the evolution, instead evolving only a partial typical linear QAOA schedule, thus creating a type of snapshot of the typical QAOA evolution. As a test case, we simulate Snapshot-QAOA on a particular 16 qubit J1-J2 frustrated square transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Entropy Density Benchmarking of Near-Term Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the limitations imposed by noise on current and next-generation quantum devices is a crucial step towards demonstrations of quantum advantage with practical applications. In this work, we investigate the accumulation of entropy density as a benchmark to monitor the performance of quantum processing units. A combination of analytical methods, numerical simulations, and experiments on programmable superconducting quantum circuits is used to build a simple yet practical heuristic model of entropy accumulation based on global depolarising noise. This demonstrates the potential of such an approach to construct effective heuristic models. The monitoring of entropy density not only offers a novel and complementary approach to existing circuit-level benchmarking techniques, but more importantly, it provides a much needed bridge between circuit-level and application-level benchmarking protocols. In particular, our heuristic model of entropy accumulation allows us to improve over existing techniques to bound the circuit size threshold beyond which quantum advantage is unattainable.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic footprints of quantum friction in nonreciprocal and chiral media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</description>

      <title>Quantum framework for Reinforcement Learning: integrating Markov Decision Process, quantum arithmetic, and trajectory search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov Decision Process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum advantage in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</description>

      <title>Grover's search meets Ising models: a quantum algorithm for finding low-energy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for implementing Grover's algorithm in the digital quantum simulation of disordered Ising models. The core concept revolves around using the evolution operator for the Ising model as the quantum oracle within Grover's search. This operator induces phase shifts for the eigenstates of the Ising Hamiltonian, with the most pronounced shifts occurring for the lowest and highest energy states. Determining these states for a disordered Ising Hamiltonian using classical methods presents an exponentially complex challenge with respect to the number of spins (or qubits) involved. Within our proposed approach, we determine the optimal evolution time by ensuring a phase flip for the target states. This method yields a quadratic speedup compared to classical computation methods and enables the identification of the lowest and highest energy states (or neighboring states) with a high probability $\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum state diagonalization with computational-basis probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel quantum diagonalization algorithm through optimizing a variational quantum circuit. The optimization process utilizes measurement outcomes in the computational basis to construct an objective function for variational optimization. Two distinct objective functions are introduced in this report. The first is constructed from the probabilities of 2^N computational basis states. By maximizing the sum of the squared diagonal elements of the evolved N-qubit quantum state, this function drives the state toward a diagonal form, with the optimized value corresponding to the purity of the input quantum state. To address the experimental challenges associated with measuring all 2^N basis states, we propose a second objective function based on N single-qubit measurement probabilities. This reduces measurement complexity with exponential growth, enhancing the feasibility of experimental implementation. In both cases, we explore the relationship between measurement probability distributions and the diagonalization of the evolved quantum state. Numerical simulations and analytical insights demonstrate that the variational optimization effectively transforms the input quantum state into its diagonalized form, offering a practical framework for quantum state diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Device-independent, high bit-rate quantum random number generator with beam-splitter-free architecture and live Bell test certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a beam-splitter-free, high-bit rate, device-independent quantum random number generator (DI-QRNG) with real-time quantumness certification via live Bell test data. Using a 20-mm-long, type-0 phase-matched PPKTP crystal in a polarization Sagnac interferometer, we generated degenerate, non-collinear parametric down-converted entangled photons at 810 nm in an annular ring distribution with pair photons appearing at diametrically opposite points on the ring randomly. Dividing the ring into six sections and collecting photons from opposite sections, we developed three entangled photon sources from a single resource (optics, laser, and nonlinear crystal). Using a pump power of 12.4 mW at 405 nm, we recorded coincidence (1 ns window) timestamps of any two sources without projection to assign random bits (0 and 1) while measuring the Bell parameter (S $&gt;$ 2) with the third source for live quantumness certification. We have generated 90 million raw bits in 46.4 seconds, with a minimum entropy extraction ratio exceeding 97$\%$. Post-processed using a Toeplitz matrix, the QRNG achieved a 1.8 Mbps bit rate, passing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 tests. Increasing the coincidence window to 2 ns boosts the bit rate to over 2 Mbps, maintaining minimum entropy above 95$\%$ but reducing the Bell parameter to S = 1.73. This novel scalable scheme eliminates beam splitters, enabling robust, multi-bit DI-QRNG with enhanced ring sectioning and trustworthy certification for practical high-rate applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</description>

      <title>The optimization of exact multi-target quantum search algorithm based on MindQuantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's search algorithm has attracted great attention due to its quadratic speedup over classical algorithms in unsorted database search problems. However, Grover's algorithm is inefficient in multi-target search problems, except in the case of 1/4 of the data in the database satisfying the search conditions. Long presented a modified version of Grover's search algorithm by introducing a phase-matching condition that can search for the target state with a zero theoretical failure rate. In this work, we present an optimized exact multi-target search algorithm based on the modified Grover's algorithm by transforming the canonical diffusion operator to a more efficient diffusion operator, which can solve the multi-target search problem with a 100% success rate while requiring fewer gate counts and shallower circuit depth. After that, the optimized multi-target algorithm for four different items, including 2-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 4 targets, and 6-qubit with 3 targets, are implemented on a quantum computing framework MindQuantum. The experimental results show that, compared with Grover's algorithm and the modified Grover's algorithm, the proposed algorithm can reduce the quantum gate count by at least 21.1% and the depth of the quantum circuit by at least 11.4% and maintain a 100% success probability.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Gradient Descent Without Coherent Oracle Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient descent method aims at finding local minima of a given multivariate function by moving along the direction of its gradient, and hence, the algorithm typically involves computing all partial derivatives of a given function, before updating the solution iteratively. In the work of Rebentrost et al. [New Journal of Physics, 21(7):073023, 2019], the authors translated the iterative optimization algorithm into a quantum setting, with some assumptions regarding certain structure of the given function, with oracle or black-box access to some matrix that specifies the structure. Here, we develop an alternative quantum framework for the gradient descent problem. By leveraging the seminal quantum singular value transformation framework, we are able to construct a quantum gradient descent algorithm with a running time logarithmical in the number of variables. In particular, our method can work with a broader class of functions and remove the requirement for any coherent oracle access. Furthermore, our framework also consumes exponentially less qubits than the prior quantum algorithm. Thus, our framework adds more element to the existing literature, demonstrating the surprising flexible power of quantum singular value transformation, showing further potential direction to explore the capability of quantum singular value transformation, and quantum computational advantage as a whole.</description>

      <title>Superactivation and Incompressibility of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the form of entanglement, quantum steering or Bell nonlocality are resources for various information-processing tasks, but their detailed quantification and characterization remains complicated. One counter-intuitive effect is the phenomenon of superactivation, meaning that two copies of a quantum state may exhibit forms of correlations which are absent on the single-copy level. We develop a systematic approach towards a full understanding of this phenomenon using the paradigm of genuine multipartite entanglement. We introduce systematic methods for studying superactivation of entanglement based on symmetries and generalized notions of multipartite distillability. With this, we present novel criteria for superactivation as well as a quantitative theory of it. Moreover, we present evidence for incompressible entanglement on multi-copy systems, which cannot be reduced to the single-copy level.</description>

      <title>Universal pulses for superconducting qudit ladder gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency relative to qubits by encoding more information per lattice cell. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold however requires very fast gate operations because the higher levels typically suffer from exponentially larger energy level dispersion, and hence exponentially stronger decoherence. We present a universal pulse construction to quickly generate unitary rotations between any adjacent levels, with the same coherent error scaling independent of the level index, and thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Our approach is tested on a transmon circuit, demonstrating significant improvements in gate fidelity across various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. We show that the primary limitation in achieving high-fidelity operations arises from the coherence times of the higher energy levels. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum computing platforms with ladder structures.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Distributed multi-parameter quantum metrology with a superconducting quantum network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology has emerged as a powerful tool for timekeeping, field sensing, and precision measurements within fundamental physics. With the advent of distributed quantum metrology, its capabilities have been extended to probing spatially distributed parameters across networked quantum systems. However, generating the necessary non-local entanglement remains a significant challenge, and the inherent incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation affects ultimate performance. Here we use a superconducting quantum network with low-loss interconnects to estimate multiple distributed parameters associated with non-commuting generators. By employing high-fidelity non-local entanglement across network nodes and a sequential control strategy, we accurately estimate remote vector fields and their gradients. Our approach achieves an improvement of up to 6.86 dB over classical strategy for estimating all three components of a remote vector field in terms of standard deviation. Moreover, for the estimation of gradients along two distinct directions across distributed vector fields, our distributed strategy, which utilizes non-local entanglement, outperforms local entanglement strategies, leading to a 3.44 dB reduction in the sum of variances.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

      <title>Effects of noise-induced coherence on the performance of a four-level laser heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of noise-induced coherence on the performance analysis of a degenerate four-level quantum heat engine with particular focus on the universal nature of efficiency, which refers to the appearance of the first two universal terms $\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C^2/8$ in series expansion of the efficiency at maximum power under a left-right symmetry in the system. Firstly, for a two-parameter optimization scheme, we derive an analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum power for the near-equilibrium condition and show that presence of noise-induced coherence breaks the left-right symmetry of the system. However, when the operation of the engine is restricted to either high-temperature or low-temperature regime, we discuss the conditions under which the left-right symmetry can be retained in each case, giving rise to the universal characteristic of efficiency. In case of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the first linear term $\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all conditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the constraints imposed on the control parameters. Finally, we examine the behavior of power as a function of noise-induced coherence parameter highlighting the role of matter-field coupling in determining the suitable operation regime for the heat engine to reap the benefits of noise-induced coherence.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Quantum: A Quantum-HPC Middleware for Resource, Workload and Task Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum hardware continues to scale, managing the heterogeneity of resources and applications -- spanning diverse quantum and classical hardware and software frameworks -- becomes increasingly critical. \textit{Pilot-Quantum} addresses these challenges as a middleware designed to provide unified application-level management of resources and workloads across hybrid quantum-classical environments. It is built on a rigorous analysis of existing quantum middleware systems and application execution patterns. It implements the Pilot Abstraction conceptual model, originally developed for HPC, to manage resources, workloads, and tasks. It is designed for quantum applications that rely on task parallelism, including: (i) \textit{Hybrid algorithms}, such as variational approaches, and (ii) \textit{Circuit cutting systems}, used to partition and execute large quantum circuits. \textit{Pilot-Quantum} facilitates seamless integration of quantum processing units (QPUs), classical CPUs, and GPUs, while supporting high-level programming frameworks like Qiskit and Pennylane. This enables users to design and execute hybrid workflows across diverse computing resources efficiently. The capabilities of \textit{Pilot-Quantum} are demonstrated through mini-applications -- simplified yet representative kernels focusing on critical performance bottlenecks. We present several mini-apps, including circuit execution across hardware and simulator platforms (e.\,g., IBM's Eagle QPU), distributed state vector simulation, circuit cutting, and quantum machine learning workflows, demonstrating significant scale (e.\,g., a 41-qubit simulation on 256 GPUs) and speedups (e.\,g., 15x for QML, 3.5x for circuit cutting).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant integral quantization is implemented for systems whose phase space is $Z_{d} \times Z_{d}$, i.e., for systems moving on the discrete periodic set $Z_d= \{0,1,\dotsc d-1$ mod$ d\}$. The symmetry group of this phase space is the periodic discrete version of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, namely the central extension of the abelian group $Z_d \times Z_d$. In this regard, the phase space is viewed as the left coset of the group with its center. The non-trivial unitary irreducible representation of this group, as acting on $L^2(Z_{N})$, is square integrable on the phase phase. We derive the corresponding covariant integral quantizations from (weight) functions on the phase space, and display their phase space portrait.</description>

      <title>A Time Optimization Framework for the Implementation of Robust and Low-latency Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered attention for its potential to solve complex computational problems with considerable speedup. Despite notable advancements in the field, achieving meaningful scalability and noise control in quantum hardware remains challenging. Incoherent errors caused by decoherence restrict the total computation time, making it very short. While hardware advancements continue to progress, quantum software specialists seek to minimize quantum circuit latency to mitigate dissipation. However, at the pulse level, fast quantum gates often lead to leakage, leaving minimal room for further optimization. Recent advancements have shown the effectiveness of quantum control techniques in generating quantum gates robust to coherent error sources. Nevertheless, these techniques come with a trade-off -- extended gate durations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative pulse scheduling approach that enables the use of both fast and robust quantum gates within the same quantum circuit. The time-optimization framework models the quantum circuit as a dependency graph, implements the fastest quantum gates on the critical path, and uses idle periods outside the critical path to optimally implement longer, more robust gates from the gate set, without increasing latency. Experiments conducted on IBMQ Brisbane show that this approach improves the absolute success probability of quantum circuit execution by more than 25%, with performance gains scaling as the number of qubits increases.</description>

      <title>Extendible quantum measurements and limitations on classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Dynamic Qubit Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard combinatorial optimization problems, often mapped to Ising models, promise potential solutions with quantum advantage but are constrained by limited qubit counts in near-term devices. We present an innovative quantum-inspired framework that dynamically compresses large Ising models to fit available quantum hardware of different sizes. Thus, we aim to bridge the gap between large-scale optimization and current hardware capabilities. Our method leverages a physics-inspired GNN architecture to capture complex interactions in Ising models and accurately predict alignments among neighboring spins (aka qubits) at ground states. By progressively merging such aligned spins, we can reduce the model size while preserving the underlying optimization structure. It also provides a natural trade-off between the solution quality and size reduction, meeting different hardware constraints of quantum computing devices. Extensive numerical studies on Ising instances of diverse topologies show that our method can reduce instance size at multiple levels with virtually no losses in solution quality on the latest D-wave quantum annealers.</description>

Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) comprises a set of mature and widely used techniques for assessing the quality of operations on a quantum information-processing system. Modern RB protocols for multiqubit systems extract physically relevant error rates by exploiting the structure of the group representation generated by the set of benchmarked operations. However, existing techniques become prohibitively inefficient for representations that are highly reducible yet decompose into irreducible subspaces of high dimension. These situations prevail when benchmarking high-dimensional systems such as qudits or bosonic modes, where experimental control is limited to implementing a small subset of all possible unitary operations. In this work, we introduce a broad framework for enhancing the sample efficiency of RB that is sufficiently powerful to extend the practical reach of RB beyond the multiqubit setting. Our strategy, which applies to any benchmarking group, uses "synthetic" quantum circuits with classical post-processing of both input and output data to leverage the full structure of reducible superoperator representations. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we develop a detailed theory of RB for systems with rotational symmetry. Such systems carry a natural action of the group $\text{SU}(2)$, and they form the basis for several novel quantum error-correcting codes. We show that, for experimentally accessible high-spin systems, synthetic RB protocols can reduce the complexity of measuring rotationally invariant error rates by more than two orders of magnitude relative to standard approaches such as character RB.</description>

      <title>Uniform Additivity of Tripartite Optimized Correlation Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory provides a framework for answering fundamental questions about the optimal performance of many important quantum communication and computational tasks. In many cases, the optimal rates of these tasks can be expressed in terms of regularized formulas that consist of linear combinations of von Neumann entropies optimized over state extensions. However, evaluation of regularized formulas is often intractable, since it involves computing a formula's value in the limit of infinitely many copies of a state. To find optimized, linear entropic functions of quantum states whose regularized versions are tractable to compute, we search for linear combinations of entropies on tripartite quantum states that are additive. We use the method of \cite{cross2017uniform}, which considers bipartite formulas, to identify convex polyhedral cones of uniformly additive \emph{tripartite} correlation measures. We rely only on strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy and use these cones to prove that three previously established tripartite optimized correlation measures are additive.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement Scaling Across a Quantum Phase Transition on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality and complex entanglement structures. This complexity is especially pronounced in the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations occur on all length scales. While quantum simulators give well-controlled access to strongly-correlated systems, the study of critical systems has been hampered by strong finite-size effects caused by diverging correlation lengths, and there has been limited progress on methods to probe many-body entanglement due to restrictions in measurement protocols. We address these challenges by using the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implementing a holographic subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, enabling the efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties also at criticality. We observe a quantum phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entanglement measures across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This demonstrates the potential of MERA for a practicable investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable code is an error-correcting code such that, for each coordinate $c_i$ of a codeword, there exists a set of at most $r+ \delta -1$ coordinates containing $c_i$ which allow us to correct any $\delta -1$ erasures in that set. These codes are useful for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems.
  In this paper, we introduce quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes and give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$.
  When a quantum stabilizer code comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples of optimal stabilizer $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are given.</description>

      <title>Exotic phase transitions in spin ladders with discrete symmetries that emulate spin-1/2 bosons in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spin ladder with discrete symmetries designed to emulate a two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson system at half-filling. Using global properties, such as the structure of topological defects, we establish a correspondence between the two systems and construct a dictionary of symmetries and operators. In particular, translation invariance leads to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for both systems, resulting in exotic deconfined quantum critical points. Subsequently, we study the spin ladder in detail. An exact duality transformation maps it onto a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory of three partons, analogous to the U(1) gauge theory of chargons and spinons in two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson systems. With the mapping between spins and partons, we construct exactly solvable models for all pertinent symmetry-breaking phases and analyze their transitions. We further make connections between our exact analysis and conventional parton gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton ionization distributions beyond the dipole approximation: Retardation versus recoil corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nondipole effects in multiphoton ionization of a two-dimensional hydrogen-like atom by a flat-top laser pulse of varied intensity. For this purpose, we solve numerically a two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation treating a propagating laser pulse exactly. The resulting distributions are then compared to those calculated in the dipole approximation. A directional dependence of the energy-angular photoelectron distributions is demonstrated numerically in the case of a propagating laser pulse of a moderate and a high intensity. It is analytically interpreted based on the leading order relativistic expansion of the electron Volkov state, showing a significant contribution of the electron recoil to that behavior. In contrast, the retardation correction originating from the space- and time-dependence of the laser field leads to a tiny redshift of the photoelectron energy spectra. Other features of ionization distributions are also analyzed, including the sidelobes and the double-hump structures of multiphoton peaks, or their disappearance for intense propagating laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat the semiclassical Einstein equation as a quantum-classical hybrid and demonstrate the formal equivalence of its two derivation methods. This approach identifies the left-hand side of the equation as the expectation value of the Einstein tensor given the state of matter, and not its actual value in each realization of the set-up. As a result, standard criticisms of semiclassical gravity do not apply, and stochastic gravity emerges as a necessary extension</description>

      <title>Free the Design Space of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in &lt;0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hardware-aware Circuit Cutting and Distributed Qubit Mapping for Connected Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers unparalleled computational capabilities but faces significant challenges, including limited qubit counts, diverse hardware topologies, and dynamic noise/error rates, which hinder scalability and reliability. Distributed quantum computing, particularly chip-to-chip connections, has emerged as a solution by interconnecting multiple processors to collaboratively execute large circuits. While hardware advancements, such as IBM's Quantum Flamingo, focus on improving inter-chip fidelity, limited research addresses efficient circuit cutting and qubit mapping in distributed systems. This project introduces DisMap, a self-adaptive, hardware-aware framework for chip-to-chip distributed quantum systems. DisMap analyzes qubit noise and error rates to construct a virtual system topology, guiding circuit partitioning, and distributed qubit mapping to minimize SWAP overhead and enhance fidelity. Implemented with IBM Qiskit and compared with the state-of-the-art, DisMap achieves up to a 20.8\% improvement in fidelity and reduces SWAP overhead by as much as 80.2\%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in extensive evaluations on real quantum hardware topologies.</description>

      <title>Inline-Amplification-Free Time Transfer Utilizing Waveform-Resolved Single-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision time transfer over a long haul of fiber plays a significant role in many fields. The core method, namely cascading relay nodes for the compensation of signal attenuation and dispersion, is however insufficient to deal with crucial point-to-point transfer scenarios, such as harsh environments with extremely deficient infrastructure and emergency conditions. In long-distance signal transmission without any inline amplifiers, the high loss of the optical fiber link becomes the primary limiting factor, and direct use of traditional photodetectors at the receiving end will bring about a significant drop in the stability of detected signals. Here we propose a waveform-resolved single photon detection technique and experimentally perform tomography on the weak transferred signal with an average photon number of just 0.617 per pulse. By adopting this technique, we achieve the time deviation of 95.68 ps and 192.58 ps at 200 km and 300 km respectively at an averaging time of 1 s, overcoming the technical lower bound induced by traditional photodetectors. This work lays the foundation for through-type time transfer with high precision in those significant inline-amplification-free scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z&gt;1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonequilibrium states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the ``crosscap quench'', to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic method to compute the effective Hamiltonian of driven nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new diagrammatic method for computing the effective Hamiltonian of driven nonlinear oscillators. At the heart of our method is a self-consistent perturbation expansion developed in phase space, which establishes a direct correspondence between the diagram and algebra. Each diagram corresponds to a Hamiltonian term, the prefactor of which, like those in Feynman diagrams, involves a simple counting of topologically equivalent diagrams. Leveraging the algorithmic simplicity of our diagrammatic method, we provide a readily available computer program that generates the effective Hamiltonian to arbitrary order. We show the consistency of our schemes with existing perturbation methods such as the Schrieffer-Wolff method. Furthermore, we recover the classical harmonic balance scheme from our result in the limit of $\hbar\rightarrow0$. Our method contributes to the understanding of dynamic control within quantum systems and achieves precision essential for advancing future quantum information processors. To demonstrate its value and versatility, we analyze five examples from the field of superconducting circuits. These include an experimental proposal for the Hamiltonian stabilization of a three-legged Schr\"odinger cat, modeling of energy renormalization phenomena in superconducting circuits experiments, a comprehensive characterization of multiphoton resonances in a driven transmon, a proposal for an inductively shunted transmon circuit, and a characterization of classical ultra-subharmonic bifurcation in driven oscillators. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of our method by comparing it with experimental data and exact Floquet numerical diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Probing critical states of matter on a digital quantum computer</title>

Abstract: Although quantum mechanics underpins the microscopic behavior of all materials, its effects are often obscured at the macroscopic level by thermal fluctuations. A notable exception is a zero-temperature phase transition, where scaling laws emerge entirely due to quantum correlations over a diverging length scale. The accurate description of such transitions is challenging for classical simulation methods of quantum systems, and is a natural application space for quantum simulation. These quantum simulations are, however, not without their own challenges \textemdash~representing quantum critical states on a quantum computer requires encoding entanglement of a large number of degrees of freedom, placing strict demands on the coherence and fidelity of the computer's operations. Using Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer, we address these challenges by employing hierarchical quantum tensor-network techniques, creating the ground state of the critical transverse-field Ising chain on 128-sites with sufficient fidelity to extract accurate critical properties of the model. Our results suggest a viable path to quantum-assisted tensor network contraction beyond the limits of classical methods.</description>

      <title>Generating Hard Ising Instances With Planted Solutions Using Post-Quantum Cryptographic Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method to generate hard instances with planted solutions based on the public-private McEliece post-quantum cryptographic protocol. Unlike other planting methods rooted in the infinite-size statistical analysis, our cryptographic protocol generates instances which are all hard (in cryptographic terms), with the hardness tuned by the size of the private key, and with a guaranteed unique ground state. More importantly, because of the private-public key protocol, planted solutions cannot be easily recovered by a direct inspection of the planted instances without the knowledge of the private key used to generate them, therefore making our protocol suitable to test and evaluate quantum devices without the risk of "backdoors" being exploited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA). Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to construct various MBQC-based Ans\"atze for parameterized quantum circuits, demonstrating that the different Ans\"atze may lead to significantly different performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of Hardware-efficient Ans\"atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally invariant gates such as neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the control of spin pair fluctuations using two-tone Floquet engineering. We consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice with periodically modulated spin exchanges using parametric resonances. The stroboscopic dynamics generated from distributed spin exchange modulations lead to spin pair fluctuations reaching quasi-maximally correlated states and a subharmonic response in local observables, breaking the discrete-time translational symmetry. We present a protocol to control the interacting many-body dynamics, producing spatial and temporal localization of correlated spin pairs via dynamically breaking correlated spin pairs from the edges towards the center of the lattice. Our result reveals how spin fluctuations distribute in a heterogeneous lattice depending on parametric resonances. This may open new routes for exploring distinct nonequilibrium states of matter and the conduction of quasiparticles in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Unbounded quantum advantage in communication complexity measured by distinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication complexity is a fundamental aspect of information science, concerned with the amount of communication required to solve a problem distributed among multiple parties. The standard quantification of one-way communication complexity relies on the minimal dimension of the communicated systems. In this paper, we measure the communication complexity of a task by the minimal distinguishability required to accomplish it, while leaving the dimension of the communicated systems unconstrained. Distinguishability is defined as the maximum probability of correctly guessing the sender's input from the message, quantifying the message's distinctiveness relative to the sender's input. This measure becomes especially relevant when maintaining the confidentiality of the sender's input is essential. After establishing the generic framework, we focus on three relevant families of communication complexity tasks -- the random access codes, equality problems defined by graphs and the pair-distinguishability tasks. We derive general lower bounds on the minimal classical distinguishability as a function of the success metric of these tasks. We demonstrate that quantum communication outperforms classical communication, presenting explicit protocols and utilizing semi-definite programming methods. In particular, we demonstrate unbounded quantum advantage for random access codes and Hadamard graph-based equality problems. Specifically, we show that the classical-to-quantum ratio of minimal distinguishability required to achieve the same success metric escalates polynomially and exponentially with the complexity of these tasks, reaching arbitrarily large values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the benefits of quantum computing for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) remains an open research question. In this work, we extend and analyze algorithms that solve COPs by recursively shrinking them. The algorithms leverage correlations between variables extracted from quantum or classical subroutines to recursively simplify the problem. We compare the performance of the algorithms equipped with correlations from the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as well as the classical linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations. This allows us to benchmark the utility of QAOA correlations against established classical relaxation algorithms. We apply the recursive algorithm to MaxCut problem instances with up to a hundred vertices at different graph densities. Our results indicate that LP outperforms all other approaches for low-density instances, while SDP excels for high-density problems. Moreover, the shrinking algorithm proves to be a viable alternative to established methods of rounding LP and SDP relaxations. In addition, the recursive shrinking algorithm outperforms its bare counterparts for all three types of correlations, i.e., LP with spanning tree rounding, the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, and conventional QAOA. While the lowest depth QAOA consistently yields worse results than the SDP, our tensor network experiments show that the performance increases significantly for deeper QAOA circuits.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion. This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover emergent universality arising in the equilibration dynamics of multimode continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we study the ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem of a few modes, generated by Gaussian measurements on the remaining modes of a globally pure bosonic Gaussian state. We find that beginning from highly entangled, complex global states, such as random Gaussian states and product squeezed states coupled via a deep array of linear optical elements, the induced ensemble attains a universal form, independent of the choice of measurement basis: it is composed of unsqueezed coherent states whose displacements are distributed normally and isotropically, with variance depending on only the particle-number density of the system. We further show that the emergence of such a universal form is consistent with a generalized maximum entropy principle, which endows the limiting ensemble, which we call the "Gaussian Scrooge distribution", with a special quantum information-theoretic property of having minimal accessible information. Our results represent a conceptual generalization of the recently introduced notion of "deep thermalization" in discrete-variable quantum many-body systems -- a novel form of equilibration going beyond thermalization of local observables -- to the realm of continuous-variable quantum systems. Moreover, it demonstrates how quantum information-theoretic perspectives can unveil new physical phenomena and principles in quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study force-gradient sensing with a coherently driven mechanical resonator and phase-sensitive detection of motion through the two-tone backaction evading measurement of cavity optomechanics. The response of the optomechanical system, solved by numerical integration of the classical equations of motion, shows an extended region which is monotonic to changes in force gradient. We use Floquet theory to model the fluctuations, which rise only slightly above that of the usual backaction evading measurement in the presence of the mechanical drive. The monotonic response and minimal backaction are advantageous for applications such as atomic force microscopy.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Quantum Distinction of Regular and Chaotic Classical Dynamics in Dissipative Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chaos has recently received increasing attention due to its relationship with experimental and theoretical studies of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, thermalization, and the scrambling of quantum information. In an isolated system, quantum chaos refers to properties of the spectrum that emerge when the classical counterpart of the system is chaotic. However, despite experimental progress leading to longer coherence times, interactions with an environment can never be neglected, which calls for a definition of quantum chaos in dissipative systems. Advances in this direction were brought by the Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture, which connects chaos in a dissipative classical system with cubic repulsion of the eigenvalues of the quantum counterpart and regularity with linear level repulsion. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. We show that the onset of cubic level repulsion in the open quantum model is not always related with chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a popular NP-hard-combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding the optimal way for a salesman to travel through different cities once and return to the initial city. The existing methods of solving TSPs on quantum systems are either gate-based or binary variable-based encoding. Both approaches are resource-expensive in terms of the number of qubits while performing worse compared to existing classical algorithms even for small-size problems. We present an algorithm that solves an arbitrary TSP using a single qubit by invoking the principle of quantum parallelism. The cities are represented as quantum states on the Bloch sphere while the preparation of superposition states allows us to traverse multiple paths at once. The underlying framework of our algorithm is a quantum version of the classical Brachistochrone approach. Optimal control methods are employed to create a selective superposition of the quantum states to find the shortest route of a given TSP. The numerical simulations solve a sample of four to nine cities for which exact solutions are obtained. The algorithm can be implemented on any quantum platform capable of efficiently rotating a qubit and allowing state tomography measurements. For the TSP problem sizes considered in this work, our algorithm is more resource-efficient and accurate than existing quantum algorithms with the potential for scalability. A potential speed-up of polynomial time over classical algorithms is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis and Its Limitations for ISD</title>

Abstract: Sieving using near-neighbor search techniques is a well-known method in lattice-based cryptanalysis, yielding the current best runtime for the shortest vector problem in both the classical [BDGL16] and quantum [BCSS23] setting. Recently, sieving has also become an important tool in code-based cryptanalysis. Specifically, using a sieving subroutine, [GJN23, DEEK24] presented a variant of the information-set decoding (ISD) framework, which is commonly used for attacking cryptographically relevant instances of the decoding problem. The resulting sieving-based ISD framework yields complexities close to the best-performing classical algorithms for the decoding problem such as [BJMM12, BM18]. It is therefore natural to ask how well quantum versions perform. In this work, we introduce the first quantum algorithms for code sieving by designing quantum variants of the aforementioned sieving subroutine. In particular, using quantum-walk techniques, we provide a speed-up over the best known classical algorithm from [DEEK24] and over a variant using Grover's algorithm [Gro96]. Our quantum-walk algorithm exploits the structure of the underlying search problem by adding a layer of locality-sensitive filtering, inspired by the quantum-walk algorithm for lattice sieving from [CL21]. We complement our asymptotic analysis of the quantum algorithms with numerical results, and observe that our quantum speed-ups for code sieving behave similarly as those observed in lattice sieving. In addition, we show that a natural quantum analog of the sieving-based ISD framework does not provide any speed-up over the first presented quantum ISD algorithm [Ber10]. Our analysis highlights that the framework should be adapted in order to outperform the state-of-the-art of quantum ISD algorithms [KT17, Kir18].</description>

Abstract: Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven. In this work, we explore and characterize various quantum properties that emerge from this specific model of PQM. Firstly, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Secondly, we analytically show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance, in the hypothesis of negligible external disturbances. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the workflow for converting qubit circuits represented by Open Quantum ASseMbly format (OpenQASM, also known as QASM) into the qudit form for execution on qudit hardware and provide a method for translating qudit experiment results back into qubit results. We present the comparison of several qudit transpilation regimes, which differ in decomposition of multicontrolled gates: "qubit" as ordinary qubit transpilation and execution, "qutrit" with $d{=}3$ levels and single qubit in qudit and "ququart" with $d{=}4$ levels and 2 qubits per ququart. We provide several examples of transpiling circuits, which demonstrate potential advantages of qudits.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wannier-Stark localization has been proven to be a resource for quantum-enhanced sensitivity for precise estimation of a gradient field. An extremely promising feature of such probes is their ability to showcase such enhanced scaling even dynamically with system size, on top of the quadratic scaling in time. In this work, we address the issue of decoherence that occurs during time evolution and characterize how that affects the sensing performance. We determine the parameter domains in which the enhancement is sustained under dephasing dynamics. In addition, we consider an effective non-Hermitian description of the open quantum system dynamics for describing the effect of decoherence on the sensing performance of the probe. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we show that quantum-enhanced sensitivity can indeed be sustained over certain range of decoherence strength for Wannier-Stark probes. This is demonstrated with two examples of non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal couplings.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum-centric simulations of extended molecules: sample-based quantum diagonalization enhanced with density matrix embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing ground-state properties of molecules is a promising application for quantum computers operating in concert with classical high-performance computing resources. Quantum embedding methods are a family of algorithms particularly suited to these computational platforms: they combine high-level calculations on active regions of a molecule with low-level calculations on the surrounding environment, thereby avoiding expensive high-level full-molecule calculations and allowing to distribute computational cost across multiple and heterogeneous computing units. Here, we present the first density matrix embedding theory (DMET) simulations performed in combination with the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method. We employ the DMET-SQD formalism to compute the ground-state energy of a ring of 18 hydrogen atoms, and the relative energies of the chair, half-chair, twist-boat, and boat conformers of cyclohexane. The full-molecule 41- and 89-qubit simulations are decomposed into 27- and 32-qubit active-region simulations, that we carry out on the ibm_cleveland device, obtaining results in agreement with reference classical methods. Our DMET-SQD calculations mark a tangible progress in the size of active regions that can be accurately tackled by near-term quantum computers, and are an early demonstration of the potential for quantum-centric simulations to accurately treat the electronic structure of large molecules, with the ultimate goal of tackling systems such as peptides and proteins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the well known Rayleigh-Ritz method (RRM) to the projection of a Hamiltonian operator chosen recently for the extension of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle to ensemble states. By means of a toy model we show that the RRM eigenvalues approach to those of the projected Hamiltonian from below in most cases but a few ones. We also discuss the effect of an energy shift and the projection of the identity operator.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study of the Non-Hermitian Semiclassical Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric semiclassical Rabi model explores the fundamental interaction between a two-level atom and a classical field, revealing novel phenomena in open systems through the inclusion of non-Hermitian terms. We propose a single similarity transformation that yields an effective Hamiltonian in rotating-wave approximation, enabling an analytical solution. The phase boundary of the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, derived from the analytical eigenvalues, closely matches the numerical exact one over a wide range of atomic frequencies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the analytical approach, especially at the main resonance. The Floquet parity operator is also introduced, providing a deeper physical understanding of the emergence of the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase. Furthermore, by analyzing the dynamics of excited-state population, we observe several stable oscillations in the Fourier spectrum, demonstrating the applicability of the analytical method beyond the single-photon resonance region. The Bloch-Siegert shift is also discussed and, surprisingly, resembles its Hermitian counterpart, except for the higher-order terms in the coupling strength. The present analytical treatment provides a concise and accurate description of the main physics of this non-Hermitian atom-field interaction system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two dimensional system influenced by a non-central potential consisting of a Kratzer potential with a dipole moment, along with a vector potential of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We explore various information theoretic measures, including Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy. our numerical results show that the Fisher information increases with an increase in dissociation energy and decreases with rinsing dipole moment, AB potential strength, and both radial and angular quantum numbers. In contrast, the Shannon entropy, the Tsallis entropy and the Renyi entropy decrease with rising dissociation energy, while they increase with an increase in dipole moment, AB potential strength, as well as radial and angular quantum numbers. These observations collectively indicate that both precision and localization of particles in space are enhanced by the increasing of the dissociation energy while they are reduced when we increase the dipole moment, the AB potential strength, and both the radial and angular quantum numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply covariant affine integral quantization to study motion in the 2D punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of the plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the punctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations gives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled states, of which bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network can be essential for further large-scale quantum networks. We propose a novel quantum network protocol called P2PGSD inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to efficiently implement the general graph state distribution in the network layer, which demonstrates advantages in resource efficiency and scalability over existing methods for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for a general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. In addition, we leverage the spacetime quantum network inspired by the symmetry from relativity for memory management in network problems and used it to improve our proposed algorithm. The advantages of our protocols are confirmed by numerical simulations showing an improvement of up to 50% for general sparse graph states, paving the way for a resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution across any network topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit synthesis with SQiSW</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main task of quantum circuit synthesis is to efficiently and accurately implement specific quantum algorithms or operations using a set of quantum gates, and optimize the circuit size. It plays a crucial role in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computation. Most prior synthesis efforts have employed CNOT or CZ gates as the 2-qubit gates. However, the SQiSW gate, also known as the square root of iSWAP gate, has garnered considerable attention due to its outstanding experimental performance with low error rates and high efficiency in 2-qubit gate synthesis. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the SQiSW gate in various synthesis problems by utilizing only the SQiSW gate along with arbitrary single-qubit gates, while optimizing the overall circuit size. For exact synthesis, the upper bound of SQiSW gates to synthesize arbitrary 3-qubit and $n$-qubit gates are 24 and $\frac{139}{192}4^n(1+o(1))$ respectively, which relies on the properties of SQiSW gate in Lie theory and quantum shannon decomposition. We also introduce an exact synthesis scheme for Toffoli gate using only 8 SQiSW gates, which is grounded in numerical observation. More generally, with respect to numerical approximations, we propose and provide a theoretical analysis of a pruning algorithm to reduce the size of the searching space in numerical experiment to $\frac{1}{12}+o(1)$ of previous size, helping us reach the result that 11 SQiSW gates are enough in arbitrary 3-qubit gates synthesis up to an acceptable numerical error.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each Floquet eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a hybrid regular and chaotic system, we use the energy dispersion to separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>An alternative non-unitary implementation for the quantum search algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an alternative circuit implementation for the Grover search algorithm by replacing the amplitude amplification part with a non-unitary gate which can be implemented by using an additional ancilla register. We show that the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state in the Gram-Schmidt process. Therefore, one can try to generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate or an approximation of this non-unitary gate. Since we still use the marking part of the original algorithm, $U_{mark}$, the complexity of the algorithm is bounded by the complexity of this operator. We discuss how the implementation of the non-unitary may not be easy task and show the approximations to this operator e.g. through linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods. Finally we discuss, how these approximations may change the complexity.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

Abstract: Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the cross-over region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum nature of the gravitational field is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges in theoretical physics. Despite significant progress, a complete and consistent theory remains elusive. However, in the weak field approximation -- where curvature effects are small -- we can explore some expected properties of such a theory. Particularly relevant to this study is the quantum nature of gravitational waves, which are represented as small perturbations in flat spacetime. In this framework, a quantum description of these perturbations, as a quantum field, is feasible, leading to the emergence of the graviton. Here we consider a non-relativistic quantum system interacting with such a field. We employ the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics, which allows us to frame classical questions in a quantum context, to define a fluctuation relation for this system. As a result, thermodynamic entropy must be produced in the system due to its unavoidable interaction with the quantum fluctuations of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner effect.It is also found that the decoherence effect caused by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is equivalent to that of an ordinary matter system with the same size and charge.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link>

Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
