      <title>The detailed balance property and chemical systems out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed balance property is a fundamental property that must be satisfied in all the macroscopic systems with a well defined temperature at each point. On the other hand, many biochemical networks work in non-equilibrium conditions and they can be effectively modelled using sets of equations in which the detailed balance condition fails. In this paper we study a class of "out of equilibrium" chemical networks that can be obtained freezing the concentration of some substances in chemical networks for which the detailed balance property holds. In particular, we prove that any chemical system with bidirectional chemical reactions can be extended to a system having additional substances and for which the detailed balance property holds.</description>

      <title>Effective multipliers for weights whose log are H\"older continuous. Application to the cost of fast boundary controls for the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple proof of the Beurling-Malliavin multiplier theorem (BM1) in the particular case of weights that verify the usual finite logarithmic integral condition and such that their log are H{\"o}lder continuous with exponent less than 1. Our proof has the advantage to give an explicit version of BM1, in the sense that one can give precise estimates from below and above for the multiplier, in terms of the exponential type we want to reach, and the constants appearing in the H{\"o}lder condition of our weights. The same ideas can be applied to a particular weight, that will lead to an improvement on the estimation of the cost of fast boundary controls for the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger equation on a segment. Our proof is mainly based on the use of a modified Hilbert transform together with its link with the harmonic extension in the complex upper half plane and some modified conjugate harmonic extension in the upper half plane.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete linear hyperbolic polyharmonic flows of closed polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the damped hyperbolic motion of polygons by a linear semi-discrete analogue of polyharmonic curve diffusion. We show that such flows may transition any polygon to any other polygon, reminiscent of the Yau problem of evolving one curve to another by a curvature flow, before converging exponentially to a point that, under appropriate rescaling, is a planar basis polygon. We also consider a hyperbolic linear semi-discrete flow of the Yau curvature difference flow, where a polygonal curve is able to flow to any other such that we get convergence to the target polygon in infinite time.</description>

      <title>The multiple Markov theorem on Angelesco sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By addressing a long-standing open problem, listed in a highly regarded collection of open questions in the field and described as a "worthwhile research project", this note extends Markov's theorem (Markoff, Math. Ann., 27:177-182, 1886) on the variation of zeros of orthogonal polynomials on the real line to the setting of multiple orthogonal polynomials on Angelesco sets. The analysis reveals that the only distinction from the classical 1886 result lies in establishing sufficient conditions for a given $\mathcal{Z}$-matrix--which, in the Markov case, is the identity matrix--to be an $\mathcal{M}$-matrix. In contrast to most existing studies, which often present highly technical proofs for specific results, this note seeks to provide a simple proof of a general result without imposing restrictions on the weight functions (such as their potential "classical" nature), the number of intervals, or the structure of the partition.</description>

      <title>Fourier optimization and pair correlation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic framework to provide bounds related to the pair correlation of sequences belonging to a wide class. We consider analogues of Montgomery's form factor for zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the case of arbitrary sequences satisfying some basic assumptions, and connect their estimation to two extremal problems in Fourier analysis, which are promptly studied. As applications, we provide average bounds of form factors related to some sequences of number theoretic interest, such as the zeros of primitive elements of the Selberg class, Dedekind zeta functions, and the real and imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta function. In the last case, our results bear an implication to a conjecture of Gonek and Ki (2018), showing it cannot hold in some situations.</description>

      <title>The rational rank of the support of generalized power series solutions of differential and $q$-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a differential or $q$-difference equation $P$ of order $n$, we prove that the set of exponents of a generalized power series solution has its rational rank bounded by the rational rank of the support of $P$ plus $n$. We also prove that when the support of the solution has maximum rational rank, it is convergent. Using the Newton polygon technique, we show also that in the maximum rational rank case, an initial segment can always be completed to a true solution. The techniques are the same for the differential and the $q$-difference case.</description>

      <title>A partial-sum deformation for a family of orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several questions one may ask about polynomials $q_m(x)=q_m(x;t)=\sum_{n=0}^mt^mp_n(x)$ attached to a family of orthogonal polynomials $\{p_n(x)\}_{n\ge0}$. In this note we draw attention to the naturalness of this partial-sum deformation and related beautiful structures. In particular, we investigate the location and distribution of zeros of $q_m(x;t)$ in the case of varying real parameter $t$.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials from the RHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deduce the asymptotic behaviour of a broad class of multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as their degree tends to infinity. We achieve this by rephrasing multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as part of a solution to a Riemann Hilbert Problem (RHP). In particular, we study multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials of the first kind (see [12]), which are Type II orthogonal polynomials with weights given by
  \begin{equation}
  w_1(x) = x^\alpha \omega(x)d_qx,\qquad w_2(x) = x^\beta \omega(x)d_qx, \nonumber \end{equation} which satisfy the constraint \begin{equation}\nonumber
  |\omega(q^{2n})-1| = \mathcal{O}(q^{2n}), \end{equation} as $n\to \infty$. Using $q$-calculus we obtain detailed asymptotics for these polynomials from the RHP. This class of polynomials studied was chosen in part to their connection to the work of [11,12], concerning the irrationality of $\zeta_q(1)$ and $\zeta_q(2)$. To conduct our asymptotic analysis we will require the following added restrictions on $w_1(x)$ and $w_2(x)$: $\alpha \notin \mathbb{Z}$, $\beta \notin \mathbb{Z}$ and $\alpha \neq \beta \mod \mathbb{Z}$. These restrictions are necessary for the asymptotic analysis but not the statement of multiple $q$-orthogonal polynomials as solutions to a RHP.
  The author wishes to extend special thanks to Prof. Walter Van Assche, who motivated this studied and provided valuable discussion.</description>

      <title>Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection $M$ of measures on $X$ under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \mathrm{dim}_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full-measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and $M$ to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. We also prove that if the Assouad dimension of $X$ is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz at $\mu$-a.e. $x$, for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting can include families of orthogonal projections, natural projections for conformal, non-autonomous or random iterated functions systems.
  As an application, we prove that for a parametrized family of contracting conformal IFS with natural projections $\Pi_\lambda$ satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter $\lambda$ one has $\mathrm{dim}_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{ d, \frac{h(\mu)}{\chi(\lambda, \mu)} \}$ for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously.
  We also prove that for self-similar systems on the line with similarity dimension smaller than one, for Lebesgue almost every choice of translations the multifractal formalism holds simultaneously on the full spectrum interval $\left[\min \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|},\max \frac{\log p_i}{\log|\lambda_i|}\right]$ for every self-similar measure.
  We prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand-Mattila projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a self-conformal set with the strong separation condition and without any separation for the collection of all Gibbs measures.</description>
