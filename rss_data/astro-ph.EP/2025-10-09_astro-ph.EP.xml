      <title>JWST occultation reveals unforeseen complexity in Chariklo's ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring systems have recently been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information on ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their composition, grain size distribution, origin, lifetime, or evolutionary pathways. Here we report near-infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by the Centaur (10199) Chariklo, providing unprecedented constraints on the material properties of a small-body ring system and offering insights into their origin and evolution. These measurements reveal that Chariklo's inner dense ring contains predominantly micrometer-sized particles and exhibits a significant increase in opacity compared to previous observations, suggesting active replenishment events. Most strikingly, the outer ring shows a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may indicate ongoing material loss, implying that the outer ring is transient, or it may reflect wavelength-dependent opacity consistent with a dusty structure dominated by $0.2$-$0.5$ $\mu$m silicate grains. These scenarios, not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, unlike anything observed around other minor bodies in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Orbital Dynamics of the Hot Jupiter WASP-12b with New Transit Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the transit timing variations (TTVs) of the extensively studied hot Jupiter WASP-12b using a comprehensive dataset of 391 transit light curves. The dataset includes 7 new photometric observations obtained with the 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, the 0.61 m VASISTHA telescope, and the 0.3 m AG Optical IDK telescope, along with 119 light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), 97 from the Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), 34 from the ExoClock Project, and 134 from previously published sources. To ensure homogeneity and precision, we modeled all 391 light curves and determined their mid-transit times. A detailed transit timing analysis revealed a significant orbital decay rate of $-30.31 \, \mathrm{ms \, yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q'_\star = 1.61 \times 10^{5}$, thereby confirming that the orbit of WASP-12b is indeed decaying rapidly. Furthermore, the computation of model selection metrics ($\chi^2_r$, BIC, AIC) favors orbital decay as the most likely explanation. However, the presence of an eccentricity above the threshold value allows apsidal precession to remain a viable alternative. We also derived a planetary Love number of $k_p = 0.66 \pm 0.28$, consistent with Jupiter's value, suggesting a similar internal density distribution. Therefore, while orbital decay is strongly supported, apsidal precession cannot be ruled out as another contributing effect, highlighting the necessity of continued high-precision monitoring to resolve the system's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observations we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary disc population synthesis I. Constraining disc parameters to reproduce disc observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Protoplanetary discs are the birthplaces of planets. Recent studies highlight the role of stellar mass sampling in determining disc lifetimes from the observed fraction of stars with discs. Low-mass stars tend to host longer-lived discs, allowing planet formation via solid accretion. Observations also reveal a strong correlation between stellar (and substellar) mass and accretion rate, typically following $\dot{M}\propto M_\star^2$. Aims. We aim to identify the optimal parameters of a disc evolution model that reproduces both the observed disc fractions and accretion rates in young stellar populations. Methods. We performed a population synthesis study exploring different dependencies of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ on stellar mass. Disc evolution includes viscous accretion and photoevaporation (internal and external). Initial disc masses and radii were drawn from observationally motivated distributions, while stellar masses followed a given distribution and a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) was introduced. Results. Matching observed disc fractions and accretion trends requires $\alpha$ to increase with stellar mass. External photoevaporation is necessary to produce low-mass discs with high accretion rates, and a time-dependent SFR enhances accretion in young clusters while extending disc lifetimes in older ones. A stellar mass cut-off reproduces the distance-dependent biases in observed disc fractions. Conclusions. Both stellar and environmental effects are essential to explain the observed properties of protoplanetary discs. A stellar-mass-dependent viscosity reproduces the $\dot{M}$-$M_\star$ relation, while external photoevaporation and extended star formation histories shape the accretion rate distribution across environments.</description>

      <title>Modeling the formation of N2 and CH4 frost on Pluto's slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context:Previous studies suggested that these frosts could result from the peculiar insolation driven by the geometry of these slopes, but this has never been quantitatively tested. We aim to investigate the origin, stability, and potential role in Pluto's volatile cycle of these localized frost deposits.
  Methods:We implemented a new sub-grid-scale slope parameterization in the Pluto Volatile Transport Model, which accounts for the specific solar irradiation and resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped terrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of volatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale transport of these species, which is key to determining the amount of frost that forms or disappears.
  Results: Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on North-facing slopes as seasonal deposits currently sublimating, predict perennial CH4 frost on South-facing slopes, and show that slope microclimates should not alter global volatile cycles.
  Conclusions: Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form across Pluto's slopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, due to the locally reduced sunlight received on inclined terrain. Nevertheless, despite Pluto's abundance of sloped surfaces, slope microclimates appear to have only a minor effect on the planet's global volatile cycles.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Radial Velocity Analysis I: Vision Transformers as a Robust Alternative for Detecting Planetary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) surveys usually require extensive observational baselines to confirm planetary candidates, making them resource-intensive. Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising candidate signals before further observational investment, but their effectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter. In this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a Transformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of planetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar activity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists and assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins. Injection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets from NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems ($&lt;$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a factor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
  Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the period and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing multi-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with semi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and irregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital periods. These results underscore the potential of machine learning to identify planetary candidates early in EPRV surveys, even from limited observational counts.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars II: Starspots and obliquities of Kepler-17 and Kepler-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show bimodal belts: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).</description>

      <title>Fomalhaut's debris disc is not dominated by primordial Plutos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in debris-disc science is that we do not know the masses of debris discs, nor the sizes of the largest debris bodies. This is because modern observations can only detect objects up to centimetre sizes, whilst larger planetesimals, which dominate disc mass, remain hidden. We must therefore use other arguments, such as dynamics, to indirectly infer disc masses and body sizes. This paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow debris discs like Fomalhaut. We argue that such discs cannot be too massive, nor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the disc would be much broader than observed. Using n-body dynamics and collisional theory, we demonstrate that the mass of Fomalhaut's disc cannot be dominated by primordial Plutos. Instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then they should have radii below $300^{+80}_{-70}$ km ($0.3 \pm 0.1$ RPluto) and above $5^{+20}_{-4}$ km. Such bodies would each have less than 1 per cent the mass of Pluto. Our conclusions are robust to additional physics, including shepherding planets and collisional damping. Our results provide independent, dynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are dominated by objects smaller than Pluto.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Medium-resolution spectroscopy reveals a carbon-rich circumplanetary disk around the young accreting exoplanet Delorme 1 AB b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young accreting planetary-mass objects are thought to draw material from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) composed of gas and dust. While the gas within the disk is expected to disperse within the first million years, strong accretion has nonetheless been detected in older systems, including the 30--45 Myr-old planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b. We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived "Peter Pan" disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A Comoving Framework for Planet Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The migration of planets within their nascent protoplanetary disks is a fundamental process that shapes the final architecture of planetary systems. However, studying this phenomenon through direct hydrodynamical simulations is computationally demanding, with traditional methods on fixed grids being ill-suited for tracking planet migration over long timescales due to their high cost and limited domain. In this work, we present a self-consistent comoving framework designed to overcome these challenges. Our method employs a coordinate transformation that scales with the planet's evolving semi-major axis, keeping the planet stationary with respect to its local computational grid. This transforms the standard hydrodynamic equations by introducing a source term that accounts for the inertial forces of the non-inertial reference frame. We implement this framework in the FARGO3D code and validate it through a benchmark test, demonstrating excellent agreement with conventional fixed-grid simulations until the latter are compromised by boundary effects. Our analysis shows that the comoving method can be over an order of magnitude more computationally efficient, dramatically reducing the cost of simulating migrating planets. Furthermore, the framework's adaptability enables efficient, high-resolution studies of planets on eccentric orbits by keeping them stationary within the computational grid. This framework serves as both a powerful numerical and theoretical tool, simplifying the time-dependent flow around a migrating planet that offers clearer physical insight. It enables long-term, self-consistent studies of planet-disk interaction, representing a crucial step towards performing planet-population synthesis based on full hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging within several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin, but is currently limited by the small sizes of the sample explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method that models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explore disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This change of trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</description>

      <title>A Link Between Rocky Planet Density and Host Star Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Mars, lacking an intrinsic dynamo, is an ideal laboratory to comparatively study induced magnetospheres, which can be found in other terrestrial bodies as well as comets. Additionally, Mars is of particular interest to further exploration due to its loss of habitability by atmospheric escape and possible future human exploration. In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission (M$^5$), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the dynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere comprehensively. Particular focus is dedicated to the largely unexplored magnetotail region, where signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found. Furthermore, a reliable knowledge of the upstream solar wind conditions is needed to study the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere, especially the different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve the three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point measurements are required. Thus, M$^5$ is a five spacecraft mission, with one solar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and four smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a periapsis within the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii. We not only present a detailed assessment of the scientific need for such a mission but also show the resulting mission and spacecraft design taking into account all aspects of the mission requirements and constraints such as mass, power, and link budgets. This mission concept was developed during the Alpbach Summer School 2022.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>

Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed 'Edge-off': Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetesimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees (`edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature with optically thin dust mass of $&gt;$$10^{17}$ grams. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allow the disk to contain orders of magnitude larger net dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.</description>
