      <title>$k$-contact Lie systems: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new class of Lie systems that are Hamiltonian relative to a $k$-contact manifold. We show that a recent distributional approach to $k$-contact manifolds along with a related $k$-contact Hamiltonian vector field notion allow us to understand relevant Lie systems as Hamiltonian relative to a $k$-contact manifold. Our procedure is more general than previously known methods with this aim. As a result, we find that a plethora of Lie systems related to control and physical problems can be considered in a natural manner as $k$-contact Lie systems. We study their $t$-dependent and $t$-independent constants of motion, master symmetries of higher order, and other properties of interest. Finally, we use our new techniques and findings to study PDE Lie systems with a compatible $k$-contact manifold, some of which become Hamilton--De Donder--Weyl equations.</description>

      <title>Almost positively curved generalized Eschenburg spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In each dimension of the form $4n-1$ with $n\geq 3$, we construct infinitely many new examples of manifolds admitting metrics with positive sectional curvature almost everywhere. In addition, we show that if $n\geq 6$, infinitely many of our examples are not homotopy equivalent to any homogeneous space, providing the first infinite family of such examples.</description>

      <title>On the Generalized Projective Riemann Curvature in Finsler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the generalized projective Riemann curvature in Finsler geometry, focusing on the properties of projectively equivalent Finsler metrics and the invariance of their curvature structures under projective transformations. We extend the existing frameworks of projective Riemann and Ricci curvatures by introducing new characterizations of quadratic curvature properties, highlighting their geometric significance in the broader context of Finsler manifolds. Our results provide novel insights into curvature behavior under generalized projective sprays and contribute to a deeper understanding of intrinsic geometric invariants within projective classes of Finsler spaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Timed Hausdorff Convergence and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sakovich--Sormani introduced several notions of distance between certain classes of Lorentzian manifolds. These distances use the Hausdorff and Gromov--Hausdorff distances and therefore extend naturally to a broader class of spaces. Here we show that, for timed metric spaces, intrinsic timed--Hausdorff convergence implies (timeless) Gromov--Hausdorff convergence as well as big bang convergence, among other related implications.</description>

      <title>Complex structures of the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz with infinite topological type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the complex structures of complete hyperk\"ahler four-manifolds of infinite topological type arising from the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. Under a natural genericity assumption on the monopole configuration, we show that the resulting manifold is biholomorphic to a hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^3$ defined by an explicit entire function, and we prove that this description persists for almost all complex structures in the associated $S^2$-family of compatible complex structures. When the genericity condition is relaxed, we further demonstrate that the manifold is biholomorphic to the minimal resolution of a singular surface. Thus, we partially extend LeBrun's celebrated work to the context of countably many monopoles.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Approach to Envelope Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new and efficient approach to the computation of envelope surfaces. We interpret one-parameter systems of surfaces as curves in the homogeneous spaces of suitable Lie groups. Using the formalism of Lie groups and Lie algebras, we rigorously capture the inherent symmetry and linearity in the computation of envelopes. In particular, the possible set of characteristic curves (which constitute the envelope surface) can be precomputed as the intersection of a fixed canonical surface and a low-dimensional set of its possible "derivatives."
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present several examples of surfaces undergoing transformations from various Lie groups. As a remarkable side result, we show that the characteristic curves and the envelopes of cones undergoing rational motions are themselves rational. Furthermore, we provide an explicit rational parameterization of these envelopes and use it to solve the trimming problem.</description>

      <title>The Willmore energy and curvature concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions of a Riemannian surface $(\W,\g)$, where $\W\subset \R^2$, into $\R^3$. We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an explicit formula for the Bergman kernel of polarized abelian varieties. As applications, we show that if two positive line bundles represent the same first Chern class and have identical Bergman kernel functions for some tensor power, then the corresponding powers of the bundles are isomorphic. We also obtain localization results for the maxima and minima of the Bergman kernel function and establish exponential off-diagonal decay estimates.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we extend the rigidity of Cheng-Yau gradient estimate in \cite{HXY} to surfaces with lower Ricci curvature bound. Motivated by these sharp Cheng-Yau gradient estimates, pointwise Cheng-Yau gradient estimates for higher dimensional Riemannian manifolds are obtained, and as their applications, monotonicity formulas for positive harmonic functions are obtained.</description>

Abstract: Given a closed Riemannian manifold $(M^{n+1},g)$,$3\leq n+1\leq7$.In this paper,we will prove that for any $c&gt;0$,suppose the number of closed $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces is finite,then there exists a metric $h$ on $M$ such that the $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces in $(M,g)$ are also $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces in $(M,h)$ and the number of $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces in $(M,h)$ is strictly greater than the number of $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces in $(M,g)$.Moreover,we will give a precise upper bound for the $L^{\frac{n+1}{2}}$ norm of $(g-h)$,which depends on the metric $g$ and the number of $c-CMC$ hypersurfaces in $(M,g)$.</description>

      <title>The multivalued inverse of a quasiregular map is a quasiregular curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that a proper quasiregular map $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^n$ of finite degree $d$ has a natural multivalued inverse $F:f(\Omega)\to \mathcal{A}_d(\mathbb{R}^n)$ taking values in the space $\mathcal{A}_d(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of unordered $d$-tuples in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and show that the multivalued inverse is a quasiregular curve (in the sense of Pankka) with respect to a natural $n$-form on $\mathcal{A}_d(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (suitably interpreted). We moreover show that $F$ is a geometrically quasiconformal map onto its image $\Omega_f=F(f(\Omega))$, and that the Hausdorff $n$-measure on $\Omega_f$ is upper Ahlfors regular.
  These results demonstrate a new connection between quasiregular maps, quasiregular curves, and quasiconformal theory in metric spaces. To establish them, we develop a theory of pull-backs of differential forms on $\mathcal{A}_d(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by multi-valued Sobolev maps, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tensor Gauge Flow Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Tensor Gauge Flow Models, a new class of Generative Flow Models that generalize Gauge Flow Models and Higher Gauge Flow Models by incorporating higher-order Tensor Gauge Fields into the Flow Equation. This extension allows the model to encode richer geometric and gauge-theoretic structure in the data, leading to more expressive flow dynamics. Experiments on Gaussian mixture models show that Tensor Gauge Flow Models achieve improved generative performance compared to both standard and gauge flow baselines.</description>

      <title>The h-principle fails for prelegendrians in corank 2 fat distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $h$-principle problem for fat distributions. These are maximally non-integrable distributions with natural symplectisations and contactisations, that generalize contact distributions to higher corank. We focus on the corank-$2$ case, where we study a natural class of submanifolds, which we call prelegendrians. Their key feature is that they admit a canonical Legendrian lift to the contactisation. Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions. This is the first example of rigidity in the study of maximally non-integrable distributions, outside of contact topology.
  First, we find an infinite family of $(2n+1)$-tori in the standard fat $(\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{std}})$, with the following two properties: (1) They all represent the same formal prelegendrian class, (2) but they are not prelegendrian isotopic because they are distinguished by pseudoholomorphic curve invariants of their Legendrian lift.
  Secondly, we define the notion of prelegendrian stabilization in $(\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{std}})$. This allows us to take an arbitrary prelegendrian and produce another one, in the same formal class, whose Legendrian lift is loose.
  In order to prove these results we also develop the fundamentals of the theory of prelegendrians. This includes: (1) introducing the notion of front projection in $(\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{std}})$, (2) proving that pseudoholomorphic curve invariants are robust under perturbations of the fat structure, allowing us to transport our results to non-standard fat structures, (3) introducing a zooming argument showing that any fat structure in dimension $6$ admits prelegendrians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tangent spaces in the setting of diffeological spaces. Several distinct tangent functors have been introduced, each of which extends the classical tangent functor from smooth manifolds. In this paper, we construct infinitely many non-isomorphic tangent functors on diffeological spaces. We compare our constructions with existing models, including the internal and external tangent spaces. Our results show that the choice of tangent functor is far from unique outside smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric and operator-theoretic formalism viewing optimization algorithms as discrete connections on a space of update operators. Each iterative method is encoded by two coupled channels-drift and diffusion-whose algebraic curvature measures the deviation from ideal reversibility and determines the attainable order of accuracy. Flat connections correspond to methods whose updates commute up to higher order and thus achieve minimal numerical dissipation while preserving stability.
  The formalism recovers classical gradient, proximal, and momentum schemes as first-order flat cases and extends naturally to stochastic, preconditioned, and adaptive algorithms through perturbations controlled by curvature order. Explicit gauge corrections yield higher-order variants with guaranteed energy monotonicity and noise stability. The associated determinantal and isomonodromic formulations yield exact nonasymptotic bounds and describe acceleration effects via Painlev\'e-type invariants and Stokes corrections.</description>

      <title>Improved Estimates for $G_2$-structures on the Generalised Kummer Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resolution of the $G_2$-orbifold $T^7/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a suitably chosen finite group, admits a $1$-parameter family of $G_2$-structures with small torsion $\varphi^t$, obtained by gluing in Eguchi-Hanson spaces. It was shown by Joyce that $\varphi^t$ can be perturbed to torsion-free $G_2$-structures $\tilde{\varphi}^t$ for small values of $t$. Using norms adapted to the geometry of the manifold we give an alternative proof of the existence of $\tilde{\varphi}^t$. This alternative proof produces the estimate $\left|\left| \tilde{\varphi}^t-\varphi^t \right|\right|_{C^0} \leq ct^{5/2}$. This is an improvement over the previously known estimate $\left|\left| \tilde{\varphi}^t-\varphi^t \right|\right|_{C^0} \leq ct^{1/2}$. As part of the proof, we show that Eguchi-Hanson space admits a unique (up to scaling) harmonic form with decay, which is a result of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While $L_\infty$ algebras are fundamental structures in differential geometry and mathematical physics, the geometric information encoded in such structures is often implicit. We address the following question: What constitutes a geometrically meaningful deformation of an $L_\infty$ algebra arising from vector bundles, and how can such deformations classify new geometric invariants?
  Inspired by nonabelian extension theory of Lie algebras, we define geometric deformations of curved $L_\infty$ algebras constructed from a vector bundle $V\to M$, and demonstrate that such deformations uniquely correspond to Lie algebroid structures on $V$. Explicit computations reveal that the first Atiyah-Chern class, expressible via deformed $L_\infty$ brackets, transgresses to the de Rham coboundary of the modular class. In the case of action Lie algebroids, the leading-order Atiyah-Chern classes correspond to the equivariant Chern characters.
  Applications to BV theories show that the geometric deformations naturally generate Poisson sigma models. These results provide a coherent framework for deriving field theories from geometric deformations of $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>Laplacians in spinor bundles over translation surfaces: self-adjoint extentions and regularized determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularized determinants ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ of various self-adjoint extensions of symmetric Laplacians acting in spinor bundles over compact Riemann surfaces with flat singular metrics $|\omega|^2$, where $\omega$ is a holomorphic one form on the Riemann surface. We find an explicit expression for ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ for the so-called self-adjoint Szeg\"o extension through the Bergman tau-function on the moduli space of Abelian differentials and the theta-constants (corresponding to the spinor bundle). This expression can be considered as a version of the well-known spin-$1/2$ bosonization formula of Bost-Nelson for the case of flat conformal metrics with conical singularities and a higher genus generalization of the Ray-Singer formula for flat elliptic curves. We establish comparison formulas for the determinants of two different extensions (e. g., the Szeg\"o extension and the Friedrichs one). The paper answers a question raised by D'Hoker and Phong \cite{DH-P} more than thirty years ago. We also reconsider the results from \cite{DH-P} on the regularization of diverging determinant ratio for Mandelstam metrics (for any spin) proposing (and computing) a new regularization of this ratio.</description>

      <title>Volume forms on balanced manifolds and the Calabi-Yau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms endowed with a $L^2$ metric on a balanced manifold. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson \cite{Donaldson10} and Chen-He \cite{CH11} in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and we prove several estimates, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criterion for prescribing volume forms, that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we prove the existence of solutions on all such manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study geometric and analytical features of complete noncompact $\rho$-Einstein solitons, which are self-similar solutions of the Ricci-Bourguignon flow. We study the spectrum of the drifted Laplacian operator for complete gradient shrinking $\rho$-Einstein solitons. Moreover, similar to classical results due to Calabi--Yau and Bishop for complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, we prove new volume growth estimates for geodesic balls of complete noncompact $\rho$-Einstein solitons. In particular, the rigidity case is discussed. In addition, we establish weighted volume growth estimates for geodesic balls of such manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact polyhedral surface (a compact Riemann surface with flat conformal metric $\mathfrak{T}$ having conical singularities). The zeta-function $\zeta_\Delta(s)$ of the Friedrichs Laplacian on $X$ is meromorphic in ${\mathbb C}$ with only (simple) pole at $s=1$. We define ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ as $$\lim\limits_{s\to 1} \left( \zeta_\Delta(s)-\frac{ {\rm Area\,}(X,\mathfrak{T}) }{4\pi(s-1)}\right).$$ We derive an explicit expression for this spectral invariant through the holomorphic invariants of the Riemann surface $X$ and the (generalized) divisor of the conical points of the metric $\mathfrak{T}$. We study the asymptotics of ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ for the polyhedron obtained by sewing two other polyhedra along segments of small length. In addition, we calculate ${\it reg\,}\zeta(1)$ for a family of (non-Friedrichs) self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian on the tetrahedron with all the conical angles equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of the blowdown Ricci shrinker in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the four-dimensional blowdown shrinking Ricci soliton constructed by Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf is strictly linearly stable in the sense of Cao-Hamilton-Ilmanen. This provides the first known example of a non-cylindrical linearly stable shrinking Ricci soliton. This offers new insights into the topological behavior of generic solutions to the Ricci flow in four dimensions: on top of reversing connected sums and handle surgeries, they should also undo complex blow-ups.
  The proof starts from an explicit description of the metric and develops a tensor harmonic analysis, adapted to its weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian and based on its $U(2)$-invariance. It further exploits the K\"ahler structure of the blowdown shrinking soliton and insights from four-dimensional selfduality. The main difficulty is that the weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian of the soliton admits a $9$-dimensional set of eigentensors associated with nonnegative eigenvalues. We show that they correspond to the Ricci tensor and gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's fourth problem in the constant curvature setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert's fourth problem seeks the classification of metric geometries where straight lines are shortest paths. Its regular case identifies the projectively flat Finsler manifolds. This broader framework breaks the equivalence between projective flatness and constant curvature that holds in the Riemannian setting, creating a more intricate classification problem.
  This paper resolves the long-standing question of how the local structure determines the global topology for such manifolds of constant flag curvature, where flag curvature is the natural generalization of Riemannian sectional curvature. We derive explicit distance formulas for all cases of constant flag curvature. For non-positive constant curvature, we establish a global classification of forward complete manifolds, a uniqueness theorem for forward complete metrics, and a characterization of maximal domains of metrics where exotic examples are constructed. For positive constant curvature, we prove a maximum diameter theorem and show the completion of such manifold is a sphere. A fundamental connection is revealed between Sobolev space nonlinearity and backward incompleteness. This work provides a complete characterization of the global geometry for the regular case of Hilbert's fourth problem with constant flag curvature.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a 1-parameter family of heart shape and a 3-parameter family obtained by gluing three footballs, both of which are examples of reducible spherical conical metrics. For these examples we verify the structure theorem given in [15] and show that such metrics naturally arise from Abelian differentials of the third kind. We then obtain the geometric decomposition using explicit metric and geodesic calculations. This offers new evidence for the interaction between the synthetic spherical geometry and the complex analytic structure of reducible conical metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rank-2 wobbly bundles on a Riemann surface $C$ of genus $g\geq 2$, i.e. semi-stable bundles admitting nonzero nilpotent Higgs fields, in terms of direct images of line bundles on smooth spectral curves $\tilde{C} \overset{\pi}{\rightarrow} C$. We give a sufficient condition for a semi-stable bundle $E$ to be wobbly: $E$ is a twist of $\pi_\ast \left(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{C}}(\tilde{D}) \right)$ where the norm of $\tilde{D}$ is a summand of the divisor of a quadratic differential on $C$. We sketch the proof of the necessary condition statement, namely all rank-2 wobbly bundles can be characterised as such, and discuss how certain singularities of the wobbly locus arise from the Brill-Noether loci of spectral curves.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. We view the regularized determinant $\log \det(\Delta_{X})$ of Laplacian as a function on $\mathcal{M}_g$ and show that there exists a universal constant $E&gt;0$ such that as $g\to \infty$,
  (1) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}-E \right|$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ has rate of decay $g^{-\delta}$ for some uniform constant $\delta \in (0,1)$;
  (2) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}\right|^\beta$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ approaches to $E^\beta$ whenever $\beta \in [1,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact analytic area law for planar QCD satisfying the MM loop equation for arbitrary loops. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines a \textbf{topological string theory} where the action is proportional to the area of the conformal map of the 2D disk, possessing no bulk quantum fluctuations.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and the perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{pert}[C] e^{- \kappa S[C]}$. This corresponds to a non-perturbative gluon condensate vacuum supporting planar graph fluctuations. We prove the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2} A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), establishing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is defined explicitly as $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2} (\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$ using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity. This ensures global validity for all regular loops ($C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{R}^4)$).
  Matching this confining factor with the gluon condensate via the QCD Operator Product Expansion (OPE) determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{QCD}^2$ (up to a universal numerical factor). This framework provides a first-principles derivation of confinement in large-$N_c$ QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>
