      <title>Mixture-of-Experts under Finite-Rate Gating: Communication--Generalization Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decompose prediction tasks into specialized expert sub-networks selected by a gating mechanism. This letter adopts a communication-theoretic view of MoE gating, modeling the gate as a stochastic channel operating under a finite information rate. Within an information-theoretic learning framework, we specialize a mutual-information generalization bound and develop a rate-distortion characterization $D(R_g)$ of finite-rate gating, where $R_g:=I(X; T)$, yielding (under a standard empirical rate-distortion optimality condition) $\mathbb{E}[R(W)] \le D(R_g)+\delta_m+\sqrt{(2/m)\, I(S; W)}$. The analysis yields capacity-aware limits for communication-constrained MoE systems, and numerical simulations on synthetic multi-expert models empirically confirm the predicted trade-offs between gating rate, expressivity, and generalization.</description>

      <title>Universal priors: solving empirical Bayes via Bayesian inference and pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically justify the recent empirical finding of [Teh et al., 2025] that a transformer pretrained on synthetically generated data achieves strong performance on empirical Bayes (EB) problems. We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{n})$ uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction. This perspective also explains the phenomenon of length generalization, in which the test sequence length exceeds the training length, as the model performs Bayesian inference using a generalized posterior.</description>

      <title>Sparse Additive Model Pruning for Order-Based Causal Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal structure learning, also known as causal discovery, aims to estimate causal relationships between variables as a form of a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. One of the major frameworks is the order-based approach that first estimates a topological order of the underlying DAG and then prunes spurious edges from the fully-connected DAG induced by the estimated topological order. Previous studies often focus on the former ordering step because it can dramatically reduce the search space of DAGs. In practice, the latter pruning step is equally crucial for ensuring both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. Most existing methods employ a pruning technique based on generalized additive models and hypothesis testing, commonly known as CAM-pruning. However, this approach can be a computational bottleneck as it requires repeatedly fitting additive models for all variables. Furthermore, it may harm estimation quality due to multiple testing. To address these issues, we introduce a new pruning method based on sparse additive models, which enables direct pruning of redundant edges without relying on hypothesis testing. We propose an efficient algorithm for learning sparse additive models by combining the randomized tree embedding technique with group-wise sparse regression. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic shape of the trajectory of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm applied to a convex objective function. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove a functional central limit theorem for the properly rescaled trajectory. Our result characterizes the long-term fluctuations of the algorithm around the minimizer by providing a diffusion limit for the trajectory. In contrast with classical central limit theorems for the last iterate or Polyak-Ruppert averages, this functional result captures the temporal structure of the fluctuations and applies to non-smooth settings such as robust location estimation, including the geometric median.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Sample Complexity for Online Constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^5}{\varepsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ learning episodes, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.
  Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Feature Learning with Time Series Embeddings for Equipment Anomaly Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In predictive maintenance of equipment, deep learning-based time series anomaly detection has garnered significant attention; however, pure deep learning approaches often fail to achieve sufficient accuracy on real-world data. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates 64-dimensional time series embeddings from Granite TinyTimeMixer with 28-dimensional statistical features based on domain knowledge for HVAC equipment anomaly prediction tasks. Specifically, we combine time series embeddings extracted from a Granite TinyTimeMixer encoder fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 28 types of statistical features including trend, volatility, and drawdown indicators, which are then learned using a LightGBM gradient boosting classifier. In experiments using 64 equipment units and 51,564 samples, we achieved Precision of 91--95\% and ROC-AUC of 0.995 for anomaly prediction at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day horizons. Furthermore, we achieved production-ready performance with a false positive rate of 1.1\% or less and a detection rate of 88--94\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system for predictive maintenance applications. This work demonstrates that practical anomaly detection systems can be realized by leveraging the complementary strengths between deep learning's representation learning capabilities and statistical feature engineering.</description>

      <title>On propagation of chaos for the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in entropic mean-field optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems on the space of probability measures motivated by the mean-field approach to studying neural networks. Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization.</description>

      <title>Distributional Deep Learning for Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Data-Efficient and Generalizable Neural Operators via Fundamental Physics Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in scientific machine learning (SciML) have enabled neural operators (NOs) to serve as powerful surrogates for modeling the dynamic evolution of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). While existing approaches focus primarily on learning simulations from the target PDE, they often overlook more fundamental physical principles underlying these equations. Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems. Through extensive experiments, we show that explicit incorporation of fundamental physics knowledge significantly strengthens the generalization ability of neural operators. We will release models and codes at https://sites.google.com/view/sciml-fundemental-pde.</description>

      <title>The Information Geometry of Softmax: Probing and Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the question of how AI systems encode semantic structure into the geometric structure of their representation spaces. The motivating observation of this paper is that the natural geometry of these representation spaces should reflect the way models use representations to produce behavior. We focus on the important special case of representations that define softmax distributions. In this case, we argue that the natural geometry is information geometry. Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop "dual steering", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts. Empirically, we find that dual steering enhances the controllability and stability of concept manipulation.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI with 2D Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Prescriptive Scaling Reveals the Evolution of Language Model Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chain-ladder (CL) method is the most widely used claims reserving technique in non-life insurance. This manuscript introduces a novel approach to computing the CL reserves based on a fundamental restructuring of the data utilization for the CL prediction procedure. Instead of rolling forward the cumulative claims with estimated CL factors, we estimate multi-period factors that project the latest observations directly to the ultimate claims. This alternative perspective on CL reserving creates a natural pathway for the application of machine learning techniques to individual claims reserving. As a proof of concept, we present a small-scale real data application employing neural networks for individual claims reserving.</description>

      <title>Logit Distance Bounds Representational Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory for Lipschitz Continuous Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability and robustness are critical for deploying Transformers in safety-sensitive settings. A principled way to enforce such behavior is to constrain the model's Lipschitz constant. However, approximation-theoretic guarantees for architectures that explicitly preserve Lipschitz continuity have yet to be established. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a class of gradient-descent-type in-context Transformers that are Lipschitz-continuous by construction. We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space. Crucially, our analysis adopts a measure-theoretic formalism, interpreting Transformers as operators on probability measures, to yield approximation guarantees independent of token count. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the design of robust, Lipschitz continuous Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Horizon Self-Normalized Inference for Adaptive Experiments via Martingale AIPW/DML with Logged Propensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive randomized experiments update treatment probabilities as data accrue, but still require an end-of-study interval for the average treatment effect (ATE) at a prespecified horizon. Under adaptive assignment, propensities can keep changing, so the predictable quadratic variation of AIPW/DML score increments may remain random. When no deterministic variance limit exists, Wald statistics normalized by a single long-run variance target can be conditionally miscalibrated given the realized variance regime. We assume no interference, sequential randomization, i.i.d. arrivals, and executed overlap on a prespecified scored set, and we require two auditable pipeline conditions: the platform logs the executed randomization probability for each unit, and the nuisance regressions used to score unit $t$ are constructed predictably from past data only. These conditions make the centered AIPW/DML scores an exact martingale difference sequence. Using self-normalized martingale limit theory, we show that the Studentized statistic, with variance estimated by realized quadratic variation, is asymptotically N(0,1) at the prespecified horizon, even without variance stabilization. Simulations validate the theory and highlight when standard fixed-variance Wald reporting fails.</description>

      <title>Scenario Approach with Post-Design Certification of User-Specified Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scenario approach is an established data-driven design framework that comes equipped with a powerful theory linking design complexity to generalization properties. In this approach, data are simultaneously used both for design and for certifying the design's reliability, without resorting to a separate test dataset. This paper takes a step further by guaranteeing additional properties, useful in post-design usage but not considered during the design phase. To this end, we introduce a two-level framework of appropriateness: baseline appropriateness, which guides the design process, and post-design appropriateness, which serves as a criterion for a posteriori evaluation. We provide distribution-free upper bounds on the risk of failing to meet the post-design appropriateness; these bounds are computable without using any additional test data. Under additional assumptions, lower bounds are also derived. As part of an effort to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, the paper presents two practical examples in H2 and pole-placement problems. Moreover, a method is provided to infer comprehensive distributional knowledge of relevant performance indexes from the available dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides statistical guarantees on the accuracy of dynamical models learned from dependent data sequences. Specifically, we develop uniform error bounds that apply to quantized models and imperfect optimization algorithms commonly used in practical contexts for system identification, and in particular hybrid system identification. Two families of bounds are obtained: slow-rate bounds via a block decomposition and fast-rate, variance-adaptive, bounds via a novel spaced-point strategy. The bounds scale with the number of bits required to encode the model and thus translate hardware constraints into interpretable statistical complexities.</description>

      <title>Certified Per-Instance Unlearning Using Individual Sensitivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certified machine unlearning can be achieved via noise injection leading to differential privacy guarantees, where noise is calibrated to worst-case sensitivity. Such conservative calibration often results in performance degradation, limiting practical applicability. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach based on adaptive per-instance noise calibration tailored to the individual contribution of each data point to the learned solution. This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy. For ridge regression trained via Langevin dynamics, we derive high-probability per-instance sensitivity bounds, yielding certified unlearning with substantially less noise injection. We corroborate our theoretical findings through experiments in linear settings and provide further empirical evidence on the relevance of the approach in deep learning settings.</description>

      <title>Linear Bandits beyond Inner Product Spaces, the case of Bandit Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear bandits have long been a central topic in online learning, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to adaptive clinical trials. Their general learnability has been established when the objective is to minimise the inner product between a cost parameter and the decision variable. While this is highly general, this reliance on an inner product structure belies the name of \emph{linear} bandits, and fails to account for problems such as Optimal Transport. Using the Kantorovich formulation of Optimal Transport as an example, we show that an inner product structure is \emph{not} necessary to achieve efficient learning in linear bandits. We propose a refinement of the classical OFUL algorithm that operates by embedding the action set into a Hilbertian subspace, where confidence sets can be built via least-squares estimation. Actions are then constrained to this subspace by penalising optimism. The analysis is completed by leveraging convergence results from penalised (entropic) transport to the Kantorovich problem. Up to this approximation term, the resulting algorithm achieves the same trajectorial regret upper bounds as the OFUL algorithm, which we turn into worst-case regret using functional regression techniques. Its regret interpolates between $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T})$ and ${\mathcal O}(T)$, depending on the regularity of the cost function, and recovers the parametric rate $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{dT})$ in finite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Survival Q-learning via Buckley-James Boosting, with Applications to ACTG 175 and CALGB 8923</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Buckley James (BJ) Boost Q learning framework for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes from right censored survival outcomes in longitudinal randomized clinical trials, motivated by the clinical need to support patient specific treatment decisions when follow up is incomplete and covariate effects may be nonlinear. The method combines accelerated failure time modeling with iterative boosting using flexible base learners, including componentwise least squares and regression trees, within a counterfactual Q learning framework. By modeling conditional survival time directly, BJ Boost Q learning avoids the proportional hazards assumption, yields clinically interpretable time scale contrasts, and enables estimation of stage specific Q functions and individualized decision rules under standard potential outcomes assumptions. In contrast to Cox based Q learning, which relies on hazard modeling and can be sensitive to nonproportional hazards and model misspecification, our approach provides a robust and flexible alternative for regime learning. Simulation studies and analyses of the ACTG175 HIV trial and the CALGB 8923 two stage leukemia trial show that BJ Boost Q learning improves treatment decision accuracy and produces more stable within participant counterfactual contrasts, particularly in multistage settings where estimation error and bias can compound across stages.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>

      <title>Perfect Clustering for Sparse Directed Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact recovery in stochastic block models (SBMs) is well understood in undirected settings, but remains considerably less developed for directed and sparse networks, particularly when the number of communities diverges. Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.
  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $\gamma_n \to 0$ and $K_n \to \infty$.
  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first exact recovery guarantee for this class of non-spectral, neighborhood-smoothing methods in the sparse, directed setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex simulator-based models are now routinely used to perform inference across the sciences and engineering, but existing inference methods are often unable to account for outliers and other extreme values in data which occur due to faulty measurement instruments or human error. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to simulation-based inference grounded in generalised Bayesian inference and a neural approximation of a weighted score-matching loss. This leads to a method that is both amortised and provably robust to outliers, a combination not achieved by existing approaches. Furthermore, through a carefully chosen conditional density model, we demonstrate that inference can be further simplified and performed without the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, thereby offering significant computational advantages, with complexity that is only a small fraction of that of current state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Random Forests as Statistical Procedures: Design, Variance, and Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random forests are widely used prediction procedures, yet are typically described algorithmically rather than as statistical designs acting on a fixed set of covariates. We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of explicit or tractable likelihoods, Bayesians often resort to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for inference. Our work bridges ABC with deep neural implicit samplers based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and adversarial variational Bayes. Both ABC and GANs compare aspects of observed and fake data to simulate from posteriors and likelihoods, respectively. We develop a Bayesian GAN (B-GAN) sampler that directly targets the posterior by solving an adversarial optimization problem. B-GAN is driven by a deterministic mapping learned on the ABC reference by conditional GANs. Once the mapping has been trained, iid posterior samples are obtained by filtering noise at a negligible additional cost. We propose two post-processing local refinements using (1) data-driven proposals with importance reweighting, and (2) variational Bayes. We support our findings with frequentist-Bayesian results, showing that the typical total variation distance between the true and approximate posteriors converges to zero for certain neural network generators and discriminators. Our findings on simulated data show highly competitive performance relative to some of the most recent likelihood-free posterior simulators.</description>

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for nonparametric online change point detection based on sequential score function estimation and the tracking the best expert approach. The core of the procedure is a version of the fixed share forecaster tailored to the case of infinite number of experts and quadratic loss functions. The algorithm shows promising results in numerical experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. Its performance is supported by rigorous high-probability bounds describing behaviour of the test statistic in the pre-change and post-change regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in the context of reinforcement learning with sparse rewards. To enhance exploration, we introduce a search procedure, \emph{${\epsilon}{t}$-greedy}, which generates exploratory options for exploring less-visited states. We prove that search using $\epsilon t$-greedy has polynomial sample complexity under mild MDP assumptions. To more efficiently use the information provided by rewarded transitions, we develop a new dual experience replay buffer framework, \emph{GDRB}, and implement \emph{longest n-step returns}. The resulting algorithm, \emph{ETGL-DDPG}, integrates all three techniques: \bm{$\epsilon t$}-greedy, \textbf{G}DRB, and \textbf{L}ongest $n$-step, into DDPG. We evaluate ETGL-DDPG on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms DDPG, as well as other state-of-the-art methods, across all tested sparse-reward continuous environments. Ablation studies further highlight how each strategy individually enhances the performance of DDPG in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandit optimization usually refers to the class of online optimization problems with limited feedback, namely, a decision maker uses only the objective value at the current point to make a new decision and does not have access to the gradient of the objective function. While this name accurately captures the limitation in feedback, it is somehow misleading since it does not have any connection with the multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem class. We propose two new classes of problems: the functional multi-armed bandit problem (FMAB) and the best function identification problem. They are modifications of a multi-armed bandit problem and the best arm identification problem, respectively, where each arm represents an unknown black-box function. These problem classes are a surprisingly good fit for modeling real-world problems such as competitive LLM training. To solve the problems from these classes, we propose a new reduction scheme to construct UCB-type algorithms, namely, the F-LCB algorithm, based on algorithms for nonlinear optimization with known convergence rates. We provide the regret upper bounds for this reduction scheme based on the base algorithms' convergence rates. We add numerical experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on selecting the arm with the highest variance from a set of $K$ independent arms. Specifically, we focus on two settings: (i) misallocation minimization setting, that penalizes the number of pulls of suboptimal arms in terms of variance, and (ii) fixed-budget best arm identification setting, that evaluates the ability of an algorithm to determine the arm with the highest variance after a fixed number of pulls. We develop a novel online algorithm called UCB-VV for the misallocation minimization (MM) and show that its upper bound on misallocation for bounded rewards evolves as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log{n}\right)$ where $n$ is the horizon. By deriving the lower bound on the misallocation, we show that UCB-VV is order optimal. For the fixed budget best arm identification (BAI) setting we propose the SHVV algorithm. We show that the upper bound of the error probability of SHVV evolves as $\exp\left(-\frac{n}{\log(K) H}\right)$, where $H$ represents the complexity of the problem, and this rate matches the corresponding lower bound. We extend the framework from bounded distributions to sub-Gaussian distributions using a novel concentration inequality on the sample variance and standard deviation. Leveraging the same, we derive a concentration inequality for the empirical Sharpe ratio (SR) for sub-Gaussian distributions, which was previously unknown in the literature. Empirical simulations show that UCB-VV consistently outperforms $\epsilon$-greedy across different sub-optimality gaps though it is surpassed by VTS, which exhibits the lowest misallocation, albeit lacking in theoretical guarantees. We also illustrate the superior performance of SHVV, for a fixed budget setting under 6 different setups against uniform sampling. Finally, we conduct a case study to empirically evaluate the performance of the UCB-VV and SHVV in call option trading on $100$ stocks generated using GBM.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</description>

      <title>Calibrated and uncertain? Evaluating uncertainty estimates in binary classification models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery, especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study, we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss, (iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our results indicate that all algorithms show reasonably good calibration performance on our synthetic test sets, but none of the deep learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study may serve as a clarifying example for researchers that are using or developing methods of uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Theoretical guarantees for change localization using conformal p-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changepoint localization aims to provide confidence sets for a changepoint (if one exists). Existing methods either relying on strong parametric assumptions or providing only asymptotic guarantees or focusing on a particular kind of change(e.g., change in the mean) rather than the entire distributional change. A method (possibly the first) to achieve distribution-free changepoint localization with finite-sample validity was recently introduced by \cite{dandapanthula2025conformal}. However, while they proved finite sample coverage, there was no analysis of set size. In this work, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for their algorithm. We also show the consistency of a point estimator for change, and derive its convergence rate without distributional assumptions. Along that line, we also construct a distribution-free consistent test to assess whether a particular time point is a changepoint or not. Thus, our work provides unified distribution-free guarantees for changepoint detection, localization, and testing. In addition, we present various finite sample and asymptotic properties of the conformal $p$-value in the distribution change setup, which provides a theoretical foundation for many applications of the conformal $p$-value. As an application of these properties, we construct distribution-free consistent tests for exchangeability against distribution-change alternatives and a new, computationally tractable method of optimizing the powers of conformal tests. We run detailed simulation studies to corroborate the performance of our methods and theoretical results. Together, our contributions offer a comprehensive and theoretically principled approach to distribution-free changepoint inference, broadening both the scope and credibility of conformal methods in modern changepoint analysis.</description>

      <title>Terminal Velocity Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.</description>

      <title>Don't Forget Its Variance! The Minimum Path Variance Principle for Accurate and Stable Score-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based methods are powerful across machine learning, but they face a paradox: theoretically path-independent, yet practically path-dependent.
  We resolve this by proving that practical training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the score function.
  We propose the MinPV (**Min**imum **P**ath **V**ariance) Principle to minimize this path variance.
  Our key contribution is deriving a closed-form expression for the variance, making optimization tractable.
  By parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns data-adaptive, low-variance paths without heuristic manual selection.
  This principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks and providing a general framework for optimizing score-based interpolation.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Static and Dynamic Regret Simultaneously in Bandits with Deterministic Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In adversarial multi-armed bandits, two performance measures are commonly used: static regret, which compares the learner to the best fixed arm, and dynamic regret, which compares it to the best sequence of arms. While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.
  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets. This yields a new model selection procedure for bandits that may be of independent interest.</description>
