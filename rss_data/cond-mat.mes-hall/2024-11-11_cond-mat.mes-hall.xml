      <title>Dynamically generated spin-interactions and nutational spin inertia in normal metal-ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spin dynamics of a normal metal-ferromagnet heterostructure, with emphasis on spin-nutation terms arising from a dynamical Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We find that the spin-nutation term is anisotropic in spin space due to the broken time-reversal symmetry of the ferromagnet. This contrasts with what one obtains in the paramagnetic state, where the nutation term is isotropic in spin space. We compute the effects this has on the magnetization dynamics derived from a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In particular, due to broken time-reversal symmetry, we predict a third ferromagnetic resonance due to nutational spin dynamics. This resonance frequency is tunable by applying an external magnetic field. We propose this as a strong indicator for the existence of nutation in spin systems.</description>

      <title>Giant Rabi frequencies between qubit and excited hole states in silicon quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holes in Si quantum dots are being investigated for the implementation of electrically addressable spin qubits. In this perspective, the attention has been focused on the electric-field induced transitions between the eigenstates belonging to the ground doublet. Here we theoretically extend the analysis to the first excited doublet. We show that - in a prototypical quantum dot structure - transitions involving the lowest excited states display Rabi frequencies that are several orders of magnitude larger than those occurring in the ground doublet. A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, and a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias. Possible implications for multilevel manipulation schemes and for multi-hole qubit encodings can be envisioned.</description>

      <title>Giant spin Hall effect with multi-directional spin components in Ni4W</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) can be used to efficiently manipulate the magnetic state of magnetic materials, which is an essential element for memory and logic applications. Due to symmetry constraints, only in-plane spins can be injected into the ferromagnet from the underlying SOT layer for conventional SOT materials such as heavy metals and topological materials. Through the use of materials with low symmetries, or other symmetry breaking approaches, unconventional spin currents with out-of-plane polarization has been demonstrated and enabled field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. Despite this progress, the SOT efficiency of these materials has typically remained low. Here, we report a giant SOT efficiency of 0.85 in sputtered Ni4W/CoFeB heterostructure at room temperature, as evaluated by second harmonic Hall measurements. In addition, due to the low crystal symmetry of Ni4W, unconventional out-of-plane and Dresselhaus-like spin components were observed. Macro-spin simulation suggests our spin Hall tensor to provide about an order of magnitude improvement in the magnetization switching efficiency, thus broadening the path towards energy efficient spintronic devices using low-symmetry materials.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of unconventional spin Hall effect and antisymmetric planar Hall effect in IrO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. However, the correlation between USHE and APHE remains largely unexplored. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis confirms the coexistence of USHE and APHE in IrO$_2$ (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric fluctuations in fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here a complete microscopic theory of a family of neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall fluids, related to the geometric fluctuations of the quantum Hall ground states. Many of the physical properties of such geometric modes can be inferred analytically. These include the chirality, multiplicity and energy of these geometric modes, as well as the relationship to the density modulation of the ground states of both incompressible and compressible fluids, with or without translational symmetry (e.g. the bubble and stripe phases). With a particular focus on the recently experimentally measured graviton modes as the special case, we elucidate both the universal aspects of the geometric modes and the non-universal aspects dependent on the details of the microscopic Hamiltonians. The microscopic theory explains some of the phenomenological components in the effective field theory and composite fermion theory. It predicts how geometric or graviton modes of both chiralities can be measured in experiments for any topological or compressible phases at different energy scales. In particular we show gapped geometric modes can exist even for compressible FQH phases, though translational symmetry of the ground state is important for such modes to couple to external probes (e.g. Raman scattering) in the long wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Tuning magnetic anisotropy in Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ monolayer through doping and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials is crucial for designing novel spintronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) under two scenarios: (I) Co and Ni doping, and (II) compressive and tensile strains. Our results show that the F5GT monolayer exhibits a weak in-plane MAE, which can be significantly enhanced by Co doping. Additionally, a $1\%$ compressive strain switches the magnetic easy axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while $4\%$ compressive strain can further enhance the out-of-plane MAE. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix analysis reveals that the enhancement of in-plane MAE in Co-doped F5GT (Co-F5GT) arises from changes in $ \left\langle {\it p}_{x} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it p}_{y} \right\rangle $ of Te and $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(2) and Fe(3). The effect of compressive strain is primarily attributed to a substantial increase in the positive contribution from $ \left\langle {\it d}_{xy} \left\vert L_z\right\vert {\it d}_{x^2+y^2} \right\rangle $ of Fe(1).</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Induced Quantum Properties in 2D Silicon Carbide: Atomistic insights from semi-local and hybrid DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Learning the rules of peptide self-assembly through data mining with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peptides are ubiquitous and important biologically derived molecules, that have been found to self-assemble to form a wide array of structures. Extensive research has explored the impacts of both internal chemical composition and external environmental stimuli on the self-assembly behaviour of these systems. However, there is yet to be a systematic study that gathers this rich literature data and collectively examines these experimental factors to provide a global picture of the fundamental rules that govern protein self-assembly behavior. In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and literature mining facilitated by a large language model. As a result, we collect more than 1,000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions and corresponding self-assembly phases. Utilizing the collected data, ML models are trained and evaluated, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80\%) and efficiency in peptide assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune our GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which exhibits markedly superior performance in extracting information from academic publications relative to the pre-trained model. We find that this workflow can substantially improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the mechanisms governing peptide self-assembly. In doing so, novel structures can be accessed for a range of applications including sensing, catalysis and biomaterials.</description>

      <title>2D versus 3D-like electrical behavior of MXene thin films: insights from weak localization in the role of thickness, interflake coupling and defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MXenes stand out from other 2D materials because they combine very good electrical conductivity with hydrophilicity, allowing cost-effective processing as thin films. Therefore, there is a high fundamental interest in unraveling the electronic transport mechanisms at stake in multilayers of the most conducting MXene, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$. Although weak localization (WL) has been proposed as the dominating low-temperature (LT) transport mechanism in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films, there have been few attempts to model it quantitatively. In this paper, the role of important structural parameters -- thickness, interflake coupling, defects -- on the dimensionality of the LT transport mechanisms in spin-coated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ thin films is investigated through LT and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. A dimensional crossover from 2D to 3D WL is clearly evidenced when the film thickness exceeds the dephasing length $l_\phi$, which is in the $50-100\,\mathrm{nm}$ range. 2D WL can be restored by weakening the coupling between adjacent flakes, the intrinsic thickness of which is lower than $l_\phi$, hence acting as parallel 2D conductors. Alternatively, $l_\phi$ can be reduced down to the $10\,\mathrm{nm}$ range by defects. Our results clearly emphasize the ability of WL quantitative study to give deep insights in the physics of electron transport in MXene thin films.</description>

      <title>Gentle tension stabilizes atomically thin metallenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallenes are atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials lacking a layered structure in the bulk form. They can be stabilized by nanoscale constrictions like pores in 2D covalent templates, but the isotropic metallic bonding makes stabilization difficult. A few metallenes have been stabilized but comparison with theory predictions has not always been clear. Here, we use density-functional theory calculations to explore the energetics and dynamic stabilities of $45$ metallenes at six lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled counterparts) and varying atomic densities. We found that of the $270$ different crystalline lattices, 128 were dynamically stable at sporadic densities, mostly under tensile strain. At the energy minima, lattices were often dynamically unstable against amorphization and the breaking down of metallene planarity. Consequently, the results imply that crystalline metallenes should be seen through a novel paradigm: they should be considered not as membranes with fixed structures and lattice constants but as yielding membranes that can be stabilized better under tensile strain and low atomic density. Following this paradigm, we rank the most promising metallenes for 2D stability and hope that the paradigm will help develop new strategies to synthesize larger and more stable metallene samples for plasmonic, optical, and catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum magnetometry of transient signals with a time resolution of 1.1 nanoseconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnetometers based on spin defects in solids enable sensitive imaging of various magnetic phenomena, such as ferro- and antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and current-induced fields. Existing protocols primarily focus on static fields or narrow-band dynamical signals, and are optimized for high sensitivity rather than fast time resolution. Here, we report detection of fast signal transients, providing a perspective for investigating the rich dynamics of magnetic systems. We experimentally demonstrate our technique using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometer at room temperature, reaching a best-effort time resolution of 1.1 ns, an instantaneous bandwidth of 0.9 GHz, and a time-of-flight precision better than 20 ps. The time resolution can be extended to the picosecond range by use of on-chip waveguides. At these speeds, NV quantum magnetometers will become competitive with time-resolved synchrotron X-ray techniques. Looking forward, adding fast temporal resolution to the spatial imaging capability further promotes single-spin probes as powerful research tools in spintronics, mesoscopic physics, and nanoscale device metrology.</description>

Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that combines elemental resolution with a high sensitivity to the local atomic arrangement at crystal surfaces, thus providing unique fingerprints of selected atomic sites in matter. Stimulated by the rapid innovation in the development of various analysis methods for probing the atomic and electronic structures of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, we present a theoretical assessment of the capacity of PED for extracting structural properties such as stacking, twist angles and interlayer distances. We provide a complete description of PED for the benchmark vdW heterostructure bilayer graphene (BLG), by calculating and analyzing the PED of BLG in Bernal and AA-stacking as well as twisted BLG for a wide range of the twist angle.</description>

Abstract: We study the superconducting critical fields of two-dimensional electron systems at (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO_3/KTaO_3}$ interfaces as a function of electrostatic back-gating. Our work reveals inplane critical fields of unprecedented magnitudes at oxide interfaces. By comparing the critical fields in-plane and out-of-plane we discover an extremely anisotropic superconductor with an effective thickness below 1 nm and a 12-fold violation of the Chandrasekhar-Clogston paramagnetic limit. The analysis of magneto-transport indicates that the enhancement of the critical fields is due to an exceptionally thin superconducting layer and to a paramagnetic susceptibility suppressed by spin-orbit scattering.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of selecting magnetic space groups by orienting the magnetization direction or tuning magnetic orders offers a vast playground for engineering symmetry protected topological phases in magnetic materials. In this work, we study how selective tuning of symmetry and magnetism can influence and control the resulting topology in a 2D magnetic system, and illustrate such procedure in the ferromagnetic monolayer MnPSe$_3$. Density functional theory calculations reveals a symmetry-protected accidental semimetalic (SM) phase for out-of-plane magnetization which becomes an insulator when the magnetization is tilted in-plane, reaching band gap values close to $100$ meV. We identify an order-two composite antiunitary symmetry and threefold rotational symmetry that induce the band crossing and classify the possible topological phases using symmetry analysis, which we support with tight-binding and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ models. Breaking of inversion symmetry opens a gap in the SM phase, giving rise to a Chern insulator. We demonstrate this explicitly in the isostructural Janus compound Mn$_2$P$_2$S$_3$Se$_3$, which naturally exhibits Rashba spin-orbit coupling that breaks inversion symmetry. Our results map out the phase space of topological properties of ferromagnetic transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides and demonstrate the potential of the magnetization-dependent metal-to-insulator transition as a spin switch in integrated two-dimensional electronics.</description>

      <title>Tunneling-like wave transmission in non-Hermitian lattices with mirrored nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a peculiar tunneling phenomenon that occurs in lattices with nonreciprocal couplings. The nonreciprocity holds for an inner portion of the lattice, constituting a non-Hermitian interface between outer Hermitian sections. The couplings are mirrored about the interface center. As a standalone system that was widely studied in recent years, each section of the interface supports the non-Hermitian skin effect, in which modes are accumulated at one boundary. Here, we investigate what happens to a wave that propagates along the lattice and hits the interface. The skin mode accumulation, which effectively constitutes a barrier, forbids wave penetration into the interface, but surprisingly, under certain conditions the wave is transmitted to the other side, keeping the interface dark, as if the wave invisibly tunneled through it. Remarkably, the tunneling is independent of the interface length, and a perfect transmission can be achieved independently of frequency and nonreciprocity strength. We derive the phenomenon both for quantum and classical systems, and realize it experimentally in an active topoelectric metamaterial. Our study fosters the research of wave tunneling through other types of non-Hermitian interfaces, which may also include nonlinearities, time-dependence and more.</description>

      <title>Evidence for $\pi$-shifted Cooper quartets and few-mode transport in PbTe nanowire three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are typically characterized by a single phase difference across two superconductors. This conventional two-terminal Josephson junction can be generalized to a multi-terminal device where the Josephson energy contains terms with contributions from multiple independent phase variables. Such multi-terminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs) are being considered as platforms for engineering effective Hamiltonians with non-trivial topologies, such as Weyl crossings and higher-order Chern numbers. These prospects rely on the ability to create MTJJs with non-classical multi-terminal couplings in which only a few quantum modes are populated. Here, we demonstrate these requirements in a three-terminal Josephson junction fabricated on selective-area-grown (SAG) PbTe nanowires. We observe signatures of a $\pi$-shifted Josephson effect, consistent with inter-terminal couplings mediated by four-particle quantum states called Cooper quartets. We further observe supercurrent co-existent with a non-monotonic evolution of the conductance with gate voltage, indicating transport mediated by a few quantum modes in both two- and three-terminal devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of room temperature gate tunable quantum confinement effect in photodoped junctionless MOSFET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of room temperature quantum hardware, our study introduces a gate voltage tunable quantum wire within a tri-gated n-type junctionless MOSFET. The application of gate voltage alters the parabolic potential well of the tri-gated junctionless MOSFET, enabling modification of the nanowire's potential well profile. In the presence of light, photogenerated electrons accumulate at the center of the junctionless nanowire, aligning with the modified potential well profile influenced by gate bias. These carriers at the center are far from interfaces and experience less interfacial noise. Therefore, such clean photo-doping shows clear, repeatable peaks in current for specific gate biases compared to the dark condition, considering different operating drain-to-source voltages at room temperature. We propose that photodoping-induced subband occupation of gate tunable potential well of the nanowire is the underlying phenomenon responsible for this kind of observation. This study reveals experimental findings demonstrating gate-induced switching from semi-classical to the quantum domain, followed by the optical occupancy of electronic sub-bands at room temperature. We developed a compact model based on the Nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to understand this phenomenon in our illuminated device better. This work reveals the survival of the quantum confinement effect at room temperature in such semi-classical transport.</description>

      <title>Stability of Weyl node merging processes under symmetry constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changes in the number of Weyl nodes in Weyl semimetals occur through merging processes, usually involving a pair of oppositely charged nodes. More complicated processes involving multiple Weyl nodes are also possible, but they typically require fine tuning and are thus less stable. In this work, we study how symmetries affect the allowed merging processes and their stability, focusing on the combination of a two-fold rotation and time-reversal ($C_2\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. We find that, counter-intuitively, processes involving a merging of three nodes are more generic than processes involving only two nodes. Our work suggests that multi-Weyl-merging may be observed in a large variety of quantum materials, and we discuss SrSi$_2$ and bilayer graphene as potential candidates</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focuses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $(N\leq4)$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this work, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates have support on a subset of sites and exhibit the NH skin effect, which can be tuned to localize on the opposite end of the chain compared to all remaining states. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. Our approach uses the Iwasawa decomposition to parametrise the transfer matrix uniquely in terms of three real numbers. This allows us to obtain simple conditions for the existence of topologically protected edge states and to provide a visual illustration of all possible solutions. In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</description>

      <title>Synaptic-Like Plasticity in 2D Nanofluidic Memristor from Competitive Bicationic Transport</title>

Abstract: Synaptic plasticity, the dynamic tuning of signal transmission strength between neurons, serves as a fundamental basis for memory and learning in biological organisms. This adaptive nature of synapses is considered one of the key features contributing to the superior energy efficiency of the brain. In this study, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate synaptic-like plasticity in a subnanoporous 2D membrane. We show that a train of voltage spikes dynamically modifies the membrane's ionic permeability in a process involving competitive bicationic transport. This process is shown to be repeatable after a given resting period. Due to a combination of sub-nm pore size and the atomic thinness of the membrane, this system exhibits energy dissipation of 0.1--100 aJ per voltage spike, which is several orders of magnitude lower than 0.1--10 fJ per spike in the human synapse. We reveal the underlying physical mechanisms at molecular detail and investigate the local energetics underlying this apparent synaptic-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Magnetic Anisotropy and Spin-Orbit Interaction by Electrical Current in FeCoB Nanomagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformations, along with defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced Friedel oscillations in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Friedel oscillations of the local density of states (LDOS) induced by a single impurity with both a spin-independent potential and an exchange coupling to the electrons in altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets. We identify features that make the Friedel oscillations and magnetization distinct from other materials with nontrivial spin texture such as Rashba metals. Because time-reversal symmetry is broken in altermagnets, both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities lead to local magnetization with the spatial pattern that reflects the symmetry of the altermagnetic splitting. The period of the corresponding oscillations provides an alternative way to quantify the altermagnetic spin splitting and the shape of the altermagnetic bands. The LDOS pattern in $p$-wave magnets, which respect combined time-reversal and translation symmetries, is rich. It reveals anisotropy related directly to the spin splitting, but surprisingly also features LDOS oscillations with a doubled period in the proximity of the impurity. The latter effect is also observed in a Rashba metal with an exchange field and originates from the interplay of propagating and evanescent waves. The obtained results are instrumental for investigating altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets via tunneling probes.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Terahertz Spectroscopy for Dual-Gated van der Waals Heterostructures at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a versatile platform to study correlated and topological electron physics. Spectroscopy experiments in the THz regime are crucial, since the energy of THz photons matches that of relevant excitations and charge dynamics. However, their micron-size and complex (dual-)gated structures have challenged such measurements. Here, we demonstrate on-chip THz spectroscopy on a dual-gated bilayer graphene device at liquid helium temperature. To avoid unwanted THz absorption by metallic gates, we developed a scheme of operation by combining semiconducting gates and optically controlled gating. This allows us to measure the clean THz response of graphene without being affected by the gates. We observed the THz signatures of electric-field-induced bandgap opening at the charge neutrality. We measured Drude conductivities at varied charge densities and extracted key parameters, including effective masses and scattering rates. This work paves the way for studying novel emergent phenomena in dual-gated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Linear Response for Weakly Disordered Multiband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a general multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local slave quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a new source term. The precise connection with the Kubo formula with vertex corrections in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the new formalism. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>From orbital magnetism to bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending the gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory to operators defined on half-planes, we prove that for $2d$ random ergodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, the zero-temperature bulk-edge correspondence can be obtained from a general bulk-edge duality at positive temperature involving the bulk magnetization and the total edge current.
  Our main result is encapsulated in a formula, which states that the derivative of a large class of bulk partition functions with respect to the external constant magnetic field, equals the expectation of a corresponding edge distribution function of the velocity component which is parallel to the edge. Neither spectral gaps, nor mobility gaps, nor topological arguments are required.
  The equality between the bulk and edge indices, as stated by the conventional bulk-edge correspondence, is obtained as a corollary of our purely analytical arguments by imposing a gap condition and by taking a ``zero-temperature" limit.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced symmetry breaking in a system of two parametrically driven Kerr-Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system comprising a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators, which are coupled through a nonlinear interaction and subjected to a parametric drive. Using the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the amplitudes of the two oscillators. For the case of almost identical oscillators, we investigate separately the cases in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven and in which both oscillators are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, we demonstrate that even when the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are identical, the system can transition from a stable Nesymmetric solution to a broken-symmetry solution as the detuning is varied.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning both $v_{F}$ and $m$ to improve the TE properties of the NLSs. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observe that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. We also find that in all TE metrics, the type-I NLS surprisingly can surpass the type-II NLS, which seems counter-intuitive to the fact that within the two-band model, the type-I NLS contains a parabolic band while the type-II NLS possesses a higher-order, Mexican-hat band. Our study demonstrates that optimizing the curvature of energy bands by tuning $v_F$ can significantly improve the TE performance of NLSs. This approach could guide future efforts in exploring other semimetals as potential TE materials by manipulating their band structures.</description>
