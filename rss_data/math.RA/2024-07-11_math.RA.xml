      <title>Cohomologically rigidity of the $n$-th Schr\"odinger algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the second cohomology space for the $n$-th Schr\"{o}dinger algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_n$. We prove that the second cohomology space is vanishing for $n \geq 3$ and show that $\dim(H^2(\mathfrak{sch}_2, \mathfrak{sch}_2)) =2.$ Moreover, we investigate the factor algebra of the Schr\"{o}dinger algebra by its center and determine the second cohomology group of this factor algebra.</description>

      <title>Artinian Meadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Artinian meadow as an algebraic structure constructed from an Artinian ring which is also a common meadow, i.e.\ a commutative and associative structure with two operations (addition and multiplication) with additive and multiplicative identities and for which inverses are total. The inverse of zero in a common meadow is an error term $\mathbb{a}$ which is absorbent for addition. We show that, in analogy with what happens with commutative unital Artinian rings, Artinian meadows decompose as a product of local meadows in an essentially unique way. We also provide a canonical way to construct meadows from unital commutative rings.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra structures for the backward error analysis of ergodic stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While backward error analysis does not generalise straightforwardly to the strong and weak approximation of stochastic differential equations, it extends for the sampling of ergodic dynamics. The calculation of the modified equation relies on tedious calculations and there is no expression of the modified vector field, in opposition to the deterministic setting. We uncover in this paper the Hopf algebra structures associated to the laws of composition and substitution of exotic aromatic S-series, relying on the new idea of clumping. We use these algebraic structures to provide the algebraic foundations of stochastic numerical analysis with S-series, as well as an explicit expression of the modified vector field as an exotic aromatic B-series.</description>

      <title>Artinian rings which are not generalized Rickart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show that there exist non-unital right artinian rings which are not generalized Rickart. In particular, we provide examples to show that, [16, Corollary 2.31] is not true for non-unital artinian rings.</description>

      <title>On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Weyl Algebras and Jordanian Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\delta$ be a derivation in a $K$-algebra $R$ and let ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ be the isotropy group with respect to the natural conjugation action of $\rm Aut(R)$ of $K$-automorphisms on the set $\rm Der(R)$ of $K$-derivations: that is, the subgroup of automorphisms that commute with the derivation. We explore the characterization of ${\rm Aut_{\delta}}(R)$ for quantum Weyl algebras and we prove that in the case of the Jordanian plane it is always a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we obtain an arithmetic characterization that allows us to trivially demonstrate that these algebras are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Computing the unit group of a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, i.e., for a commutative ring $R$ whose additive group is finitely generated, it is known that the group of units of $R$ is finitely generated, as well. Our main results are algorithms to compute generators and the structure of this group. This is achieved by reducing the task first to the case of reduced rings, then to torsion-free reduced rings, and finally to an order in a reduced ring. The simplified cases are treated via a calculation of exponent lattices and various algorithms to compute the minimal primes, primitive idempotents, and other basic objects. All algorithms have been implemented and are available as a SageMath package. Whenever possible, the time complexity of the described methods is tracked carefully.</description>
