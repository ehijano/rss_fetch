      <title>Charging capacitors using diodes at different temperatures. I Theor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear elements in a rectifying circuit can be used to harvest energy from thermal fluctuations either steadily or transitorily. We study an energy harvesting system comprising a small variable capacitor (e.g., free standing graphene) wired to two diodes and two storage capacitors that may be kept at different temperatures (or at a single one) and use two current loops. The system reaches very rapidly a quasi stationary state with constant overall charge while the difference of the charges at the storage capacitors evolves much more slowly to its stationary value. In this paper, we extract an exponentially small factor out of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and use a Chapman-Enskog procedure to describe the long evolution of the marginal probability density for the charge difference, from the quasi stationary state to the final stationary state (thermal equilibrium for equal temperatures). The second paper of this series shows that the results of the perturbation procedure compare well with direct numerical simulations. For a specific form of the diodes' nonlinear mobilities, we can approximate the quasi stationary state by Gaussian functions and further study the evolution of the marginal probability density. The latter adopts the shape of a slowly expanding pulse (comprising left and right moving wave fronts whose fore edges become sharper as time elapses) in the space of charge differences that leaves the final stationary state behind it.</description>

      <title>Charging capacitors using diodes at different temperatures. II Numerical studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is presented in a series of two papers. The first paper is an analytical study. This is the second paper, and here we numerically study the thermal energy harvesting capability of two electronic circuits. The first circuit consists of a diode and capacitor in series. We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation and show the capacitor initially charges and then discharges to zero. The peak charge on the capacitor increases with temperature, capacitance, and diode quality. The second circuit has two current loops with one small capacitor, two storage capacitors, and two diodes wired in opposition. When the diodes are held at different temperatures we observe a non-zero steady-state charge is accumulated on both storage capacitors. The magnitude of the stored charges are nearly equal but the signs are opposite. When resistors are used in place of diodes there is no transient and no steady-state charge buildup. Numerical studies for the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation are presented and confirm the steady state charges.</description>

      <title>On Critical Temperature and Finite Size Scaling of Continuous Spin $2d$ Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the critical temperature $T_c$ of continuous spin $2d$ square-lattice Ising model using Monte-Carlo simulation. We have considered spins $s$ in a bounded interval, where $s \in [-1,+1]$ in square-lattice configuration with periodic boundary condition. We have observed that the critical temperature $T_c$ is approximately $0.925$, showing a clear second order phase transition. Considering finite size scaling, we have also obtained the critical exponents associated with susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization and we find that these values are in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained for the standard $2d$ Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Memory of topologically constrained disorder in Shakti artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex behaviors often sit at a critical threshold between order and disorder. But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of "memory of disorder" remains poorly explored, as memory is often associated to the retention of metastable order. In recent years artificial frustrated materials -- in particular arrays of frustrated nanomagnets known as artificial spin ices -- have been employed to study complex disorders and its wealth of exotic behaviors, yet their memory properties have received much less attention. Here, we investigate both analytically and numerically the sequence-dependent responses of two somehow opposite yet related artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered but topologically-ordered Shakti spin ice. We find that Shakti exhibits a pronounced sequence-dependent response, whereas in the square lattice, such path dependence is absent. Within Shakti, even the minimal periodic supercell demonstrates both deterministic and stochastic forms of sequence memory, depending on the interaction strength. Extending our study to cyclic driving, we find that retracing the same input path leads to enhanced memory retention. These results open new perspectives on how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, hitherto examined mainly in terms of their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in Rugged Energy Landscapes in the Presence of Spatial Correlations : A Surprising Route to Zwanzig's Mean-Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion in rugged free-energy landscapes is central to diverse problems in chemical physics, biomolecular dynamics, polymer transport and numerous disordered systems. Zwanzig's well-known classic mean-field theory predicts that roughness reduces the diffusion coefficient by an exponential factor determined solely by the variance of the disorder. However, the numerical studies of Banerjee, Seki, and Bagchi (BSB) showed that this result fails for uncorrelated Gaussian-distributed site energies because rare but deep three-site traps dominate long-time transport. BSB introduced Gaussian \emph{spatial} correlations - originally developed in astrophysics to model turbulent density fluctuations - and demonstrated that even modest correlations suppress these pathological traps and restore Zwanzig's exponential scaling. Here we present here a unified theoretical framework clarifying (i) why Zwanzig's local averaging, may be viewed as a Gaussian cumulant expansion, could breakdown. In particular, how its validity is destroyed by uncorrelated disorder, and (ii) how Gaussian spatial correlations reshape roughness increments, eliminate asymmetric multi-site traps, and thereby recover mean-field diffusion, and (iii) a derivation showing exactly how Gaussian spatial correlations modify roughness increments, trap statistics, and ultimately the diffusion constant. We also provide explicit numerical triplet examples illustrating the dramatic reduction of escape times produced by spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>Site-Order Optimization in the Density Matrix Renormalization Group via Multi-Site Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid digital-analog protocols for simulating quantum multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum simulators promise to explore quantum many-body physics beyond classical computation, their capabilities are limited by the available native interactions in the hardware. On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Fusion in a (2+1)-dimensional Lattice Model with Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>On prethermal time crystals from semi-holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a pair of almost dissipationless oscillating modes at low temperatures in both the shear and sound channels of a hybrid quantum system, comprised of a weakly self-interacting perturbative sector coupled to strongly self-interacting holographic degrees of freedom described by a black hole geometry. We argue that these modes realize prethermal time-crystal behavior in semiholographic systems without fine-tuning and can be observed by measuring operators that probe either the hard (perturbative) or the soft (holographic) sector. We also find novel Gregory Laflamme type instabilities that lead to the formation of inhomogeneities at higher temperatures. These results provide evidence that black holes with planar horizons and dynamical boundary conditions can develop both inhomogeneous and metastable time crystal phases over a wide range of temperatures set by an intermediate scale. Furthermore, they suggest that such phases can be realized without external driving in nonAbelian plasmas of asymptotically free gauge theories in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Bethe-ansatz study of the Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional mixture of bosons and spinless fermions with contact interactions. In this system, the excitations at low energies are described by four linearly dispersing modes characterized by two excitation velocities. Here we study the velocities in a system with equal interaction strengths and equal masses of bosons and fermions. The resulting model is integrable and admits an exact Bethe-ansatz solution. We analyze it and analytically derive various exact results, which include the Drude weight matrix. We show that the excitation velocities can be calculated from the knowledge of the matrices of compressibility and the Drude weights, as their squares are the eigenvalues of the product of the two matrices. The elements of the Drude weight matrix obey certain sum rules as a consequence of Galilean invariance. Our results are consistent with the presence of a momentum-momentum coupling term between the two subsystems of bosons and fermions in the effective low-energy Hamiltonian. The analytical method developed in the present study can be extended to other models that possess a nested Bethe-ansatz structure.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent fluctuating local field approach for description of the correlated fermions dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent Fluctuating Local Field (TD-FLF) method for correlated fermion dynamics, extending the stationary FLF approach. The wavefunction is approximated as an ensemble of non-interacting states subject to a classical fluctuating field, with dynamics encoded in the field's time-dependent distribution. This reduces the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to a generalized eigenvalue problem in a significantly reduced basis. Applied to half-filled 2D Hubbard lattices, TD-FLF yields highly accurate results, outperforming mean-field theory and capturing oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in good agreement with exact diagonalization. Its low computational cost and flexibility make TD-FLF a promising tool for simulating driven correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Breakdown Condensate as a Disorder-Free Quantum Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a one-dimensional spin quantum breakdown model, which has an exponential $U(1)$ symmetry with charge unit decaying as $2^{-j}$ with site position $j$. By exact diagonalization (ED), we show that the model with spin $S\ge2$ exhibits an exponential $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase dubbed a quantum breakdown condensate. It exhibits a bulk gap violating the Goldstone theorem, and an edge mode only on the left edge if in open boundary condition. In a length $L$ lattice, the condensate has $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of SSB ground states originating from the $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of exponential $U(1)$ charge sectors, leading to a finite entropy density $\ln 2$. This enforces a first order SSB phase transition into this phase, as observed in ED and verified in the large $S$ limit on an exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson line. The condensate has an SSB order parameter being the local in-plane spin, which points in angles related by the chaotic Bernoulli (dyadic) map and thus is effectively random. Moreover, we show the condensate exhibits non-decaying local autocorrelations, and does not have an off-diagonal long-range order. The quantum breakdown condensate thus behaves as a disorder-free quantum glass and is beyond the existing classifications of phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Network of Brain Dynamics: Hierarchy of Approximations to Quasi-critical Neural Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interacting branching model of neural network dynamics, incorporating key biological features such as inhibition with several types of inhibitory interactions. We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-criticality hypothesis in that it displays regions of maximal dynamical susceptibility and maximal mutual information predicated on the strength of the external stimuli. Directed percolation emerges as the universality class of the critical transition of the model, consistent with some previous experimental data and models. In the unstable phase, chaotic dynamics emerge, which may be linked to the occurrence of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Charge-Informed Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a "confidently incorrect" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes.</description>

      <title>Information Critical Phases under Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.
  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N&gt;4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relying on the quantum tunnelling concept and Maxwell-Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, Gamow shows that the star-burning process happens at temperatures comparable to a critical value, called the Gamow temperature ({\tt T}) and less than the prediction of the classical framework. In order to highlight the role of the equipartition theorem in the Gamow argument, a thermal length scale is defined, and then the effects of non-extensivity on the Gamow temperature have been investigated by focusing on the Tsallis and Kaniadakis statistics. The results attest that while the Gamow temperature decreases in the framework of Kaniadakis statistics, it can be bigger or smaller than {\tt T} when Tsallis statistics are employed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems with optical tweezers: theory and practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation, are effective tools connecting non-equilibrium work statistics and equilibrium free energy differences. However, detailed hands-on, reproducible protocols for implementing and analyzing these relations in real experiments remain scarce. This tutorial provides an end-to-end workflow for measuring, validating, and applying fluctuation theorems using a single-beam optical tweezers setup. It introduces the foundational ideas and consolidates practical calibration (PSD-based trap stiffness and position sensitivity), protocol design (forward/reverse finite-time drives over multiple amplitudes and durations), and robust estimators for free-energy difference and dissipated work, highlighting finite-sampling and rare-event effects. We demonstrate the procedures using an extensive set of measured trajectories under different conditions and provide openly accessible datasets and Python code, enabling new researchers or educators to reproduce the results with minimal effort. Beyond pedagogical validation, we discuss how these recipes translate to broader soft-matter and mesoscopic contexts. By combining user-friendly instruments with clear and transparent analysis, this work promotes the education and reliable adoption of stochastic thermodynamic methods in the curricula of physics and chemistry, as well as among emerging research teams.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Variational Principle Unifying Gravity and Heat Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the stable phase configuration in a liquid-gas system becomes a fundamental challenge when the stratification favored by gravity conflicts with arrangements induced by heat flow, particularly because standard equilibrium thermodynamics is insufficient in such non-equilibrium steady states. We propose a variational principle based on an extended thermodynamics, called global thermodynamics, to address this state selection problem. Our key finding is that gravity and heat flow effects are unified into a single parameter, ``effective gravity'' ($g_\mathrm{eff}$), within this framework. Crucially, the sign of $g_\mathrm{eff}$ determines the stable configuration: liquid is at the bottom if $g_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0$, and floats above the gas if $g_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 0$. This provides a quantitative tool for the configuration prediction under competing drives.</description>

      <title>Recursive entropy in thermodynamics: establishing the statistical-physics basis of the zentropy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recursive property of entropy is well known in the field of information theory; however, the concept is rarely used in the field of thermodynamics, despite being the field where the concept of entropy originated. This work shows that the equation for entropy used in the zentropy approach, which is an exact multiscale approach to thermodynamics, is a statement of the recursive property of entropy. Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational and intra-configurational contributions. Building on this, we derive the Helmholtz energy and the partition function, as used in zentropy. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>50 years of Yukhnovskii's critical point theory: its place in the constant flow of theoretical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Half a century ago, Ihor Yukhnovskii elaborated a method of studying the critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model based on a layer-by-layer integration in the space of collective variables. His method was an alternative to that based on the $\varepsilon$-expansion for which K. G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982. However, Yukhnovskii's technique, which yielded similar results, provided even deeper insight into the nature of this phenomenon. At that time, we, professor's students, saw only this aspect of his theory. Later, I realized that the mentioned Yukhnovskii's work naturally fits into a more general context of the turbulent development of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The aim of the present article is to look at the main aspects and the impact of Yukhnovskii's theory from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior of independent scaled Brownian particles with renewal resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study collective dynamics of an ensemble of $N\gg 1$ independent particles undergoing anomalous diffusion with random renewal resetting. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H}$, where $H&gt;0$. The particles independently reset to the origin, and each particle's clock is set to zero upon spatial resetting. Employing the known steady-state position distribution of a \emph{single} particle undergoing the sBm with renewal resetting [Bodrova et al., Phys. Rev. E \textbf{100}, 012120 (2019)], we study the collective dynamics of $N$ particles. We determine the statistics of the system radius $\ell$. The typical fluctuations of $\ell$ fall under the Gumbel universality class, and we use extreme value statistics to calculate the moments of $\ell$. We also study the large-deviation statistics of the center of mass (COM), where for $H&gt;1/2$ we uncover an anomalous scaling behavior of the COM distribution, and a singularity in the corresponding rate function, due to a ``big jump" effect.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters: $R$ measuring right-oriented influence and $L$ measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>
