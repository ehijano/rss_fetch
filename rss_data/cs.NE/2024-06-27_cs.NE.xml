      <title>CATBench: A Compiler Autotuning Benchmarking Suite for Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for automating tuning of compilers. The complex landscape of autotuning provides a myriad of rarely considered structural challenges for black-box optimizers, and the lack of standardized benchmarks has limited the study of Bayesian optimization within the domain. To address this, we present CATBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that captures the complexities of compiler autotuning, ranging from discrete, conditional, and permutation parameter types to known and unknown binary constraints, as well as both multi-fidelity and multi-objective evaluations. The benchmarks in CATBench span a range of machine learning-oriented computations, from tensor algebra to image processing and clustering, and uses state-of-the-art compilers, such as TACO and RISE/ELEVATE. CATBench offers a unified interface for evaluating Bayesian optimization algorithms, promoting reproducibility and innovation through an easy-to-use, fully containerized setup of both surrogate and real-world compiler optimization tasks. We validate CATBench on several state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrating the suite's potential for advancing both Bayesian optimization and compiler autotuning research.</description>

      <title>CLIF: Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired energy-efficient models. Compared to conventional deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs exhibit superior efficiency and capability to process temporal information. However, it remains a challenge to train SNNs due to their undifferentiable spiking mechanism. The surrogate gradients method is commonly used to train SNNs, but often comes with an accuracy disadvantage over ANNs counterpart. We link the degraded accuracy to the vanishing of gradient on the temporal dimension through the analytical and experimental study of the training process of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron-based SNNs. Moreover, we propose the Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CLIF) Neuron. CLIF creates extra paths to facilitate the backpropagation in computing temporal gradient while keeping binary output. CLIF is hyperparameter-free and features broad applicability. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate CLIF's clear performance advantage over other neuron models. Furthermore, the CLIF's performance even slightly surpasses superior ANNs with identical network structure and training conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/HuuYuLong/Complementary-LIF.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Visual Scene Understanding with Resonator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing a visual scene by inferring the configuration of a generative model is widely considered the most flexible and generalizable approach to scene understanding. Yet, one major problem is the computational challenge of the inference procedure, involving a combinatorial search across object identities and poses. Here we propose a neuromorphic solution exploiting three key concepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical Resonator Networks (HRN) to factorize the non-commutative transforms translation and rotation in visual scenes; (3) the design of a multi-compartment spiking phasor neuron model for implementing complex-valued resonator networks on neuromorphic hardware. The VSA framework uses vector binding operations to form a generative image model in which binding acts as the equivariant operation for geometric transformations. A scene can, therefore, be described as a sum of vector products, which can then be efficiently factorized by a resonator network to infer objects and their poses. The HRN features a partitioned architecture in which vector binding is equivariant for horizontal and vertical translation within one partition and for rotation and scaling within the other partition. The spiking neuron model allows mapping the resonator network onto efficient and low-power neuromorphic hardware. Our approach is demonstrated on synthetic scenes composed of simple 2D shapes undergoing rigid geometric transformations and color changes. A companion paper demonstrates the same approach in real-world application scenarios for machine vision and robotics.</description>

      <title>Visual Odometry with Neuromorphic Resonator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is a method to estimate self-motion of a mobile robot using visual sensors. Unlike odometry based on integrating differential measurements that can accumulate errors, such as inertial sensors or wheel encoders, visual odometry is not compromised by drift. However, image-based VO is computationally demanding, limiting its application in use cases with low-latency, -memory, and -energy requirements. Neuromorphic hardware offers low-power solutions to many vision and AI problems, but designing such solutions is complicated and often has to be assembled from scratch. Here we propose to use Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) as an abstraction layer to design algorithms compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Building from a VSA model for scene analysis, described in our companion paper, we present a modular neuromorphic algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two-dimensional VO tasks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm stores and updates a working memory of the presented visual environment. Based on this working memory, a resonator network estimates the changing location and orientation of the camera. We experimentally validate the neuromorphic VSA-based approach to VO with two benchmarks: one based on an event camera dataset and the other in a dynamic scene with a robotic task.</description>

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are both based on the tenet of "science and technology are people-oriented", and both need to achieve efficient communication with the human brain. Based on multi-disciplinary research in systems neuroscience, computer architecture, and functional organic materials, we proposed the concept of using AI to simulate the operating principles and materials of the brain in hardware to develop brain-inspired intelligence technology, and realized the preparation of neuromorphic computing devices and basic materials. We simulated neurons and neural networks in terms of material and morphology, using a variety of organic polymers as the base materials for neuroelectronic devices, for building neural interfaces as well as organic neural devices and silicon neural computational modules. We assemble organic artificial synapses with simulated neurons from silicon-based Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) into organic artificial neurons, the basic components of neural networks, and later construct biological neural network models based on the interpreted neural circuits. Finally, we also discuss how to further build neuromorphic devices based on these organic artificial neurons, which have both a neural interface friendly to nervous tissue and interact with information from real biological neural networks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking mortality risk prediction from electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent high-impact studies leverage large hospital-owned electrocardiographic (ECG) databases to model and predict patient mortality. MIMIC-IV, released September 2023, is the first comparable public dataset and includes 800,000 ECGs from a U.S. hospital system. Previously, the largest public ECG dataset was Code-15, containing 345,000 ECGs collected during routine care in Brazil. These datasets now provide an excellent resource for a broader audience to explore ECG survival modeling. Here, we benchmark survival model performance on Code-15 and MIMIC-IV with two neural network architectures, compare four deep survival modeling approaches to Cox regressions trained on classifier outputs, and evaluate performance at one to ten years. Our results yield AUROC and concordance scores comparable to past work (circa 0.8) and reasonable AUPRC scores (MIMIC-IV: 0.4-0.5, Code-15: 0.05-0.13) considering the fraction of ECG samples linked to a mortality (MIMIC-IV: 27\%, Code-15: 4\%). When evaluating models on the opposite dataset, AUROC and concordance values drop by 0.1-0.15, which may be due to cohort differences. All code and results are made public.</description>
