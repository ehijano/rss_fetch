      <title>Designing Robust Quantum Neural Networks: Exploring Expressibility, Entanglement, and Control Rotation Gate Selection for Enhanced Quantum Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the robustness of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) in comparison to their classical counterparts, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), against two adversarial attacks: FGSM and PGD, for the image classification task on both MNIST and FMNIST datasets. To enhance the robustness of QuNNs, we developed a novel methodology that utilizes three quantum circuit metrics: expressibility, entanglement capability, and controlled rotation gate selection. Our analysis shows that these metrics significantly influence data representation within the Hilbert space, thereby directly affecting QuNN robustness. We rigorously established that circuits with higher expressibility and lower entanglement capability generally exhibit enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions, particularly at low-spectrum perturbation strengths where most attacks occur. Furthermore, our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that expressibility alone dictates circuit robustness; instead, we demonstrate that the inclusion of controlled rotation gates around the Z-axis generally enhances the resilience of QuNNs. Our results demonstrate that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% greater robustness on the MNIST dataset and 40% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset compared to CNNs. Collectively, our work elucidates the relationship between quantum circuit metrics and robust data feature extraction, advancing the field by improving the adversarial robustness of QuNNs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Management: A Semi Non-Technical Guide for Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of energy transition necessitates the coordination of several technologies, including more efficient and cost-effective distributed energy resources (DERs), smart grids, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), energy-efficient technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, artificial intellience (AI) and nuclear energy, among others. Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm for information processing at both hardware and software levels, by exploiting quantum mechanical properties to solve certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. This chapter will explore the opportunities and challenges of using quantum computing for energy management applications, enabling the more efficient and economically optimal integration of DERs such as solar PV rooftops, energy storage systems, electric vehicles (EVs), and EV charging stations into the grid</description>

Abstract: Feynman's modification to electrodynamics and its application to the calculation of self-energy of a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle, appearing in his 1948 Physical Review paper, is shown to be applicable for the self-energy calculation of a free spin-0 particle as well. Feynman's modification to electrodynamics is shown to be equivalent to a Hamiltonian approach developed by Podolsky.</description>

      <title>Learning complexity gradually in quantum machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is an emergent field that continues to draw significant interest for its potential to offer improvements over classical algorithms in certain areas. However, training quantum models remains a challenging task, largely because of the difficulty in establishing an effective inductive bias when solving high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a training framework that prioritizes informative data points over the entire training set. This approach draws inspiration from classical techniques such as curriculum learning and hard example mining to introduce an additional inductive bias through the training data itself. By selectively focusing on informative samples, we aim to steer the optimization process toward more favorable regions of the parameter space. This data-centric approach complements existing strategies such as warm-start initialization methods, providing an additional pathway to address performance challenges in quantum machine learning. We provide theoretical insights into the benefits of prioritizing informative data for quantum models, and we validate our methodology with numerical experiments on selected recognition tasks of quantum phases of matter. Our findings indicate that this strategy could be a valuable approach for improving the performance of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Domain walls from SPT-sewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing gapped domain walls of topologically ordered systems by gauging a lower-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Based on our construction, we propose a correspondence between 1d SPT phases with a non-invertible $G\times \text{Rep}(G)\times G$ symmetry and invertible domain walls in the quantum double associated with the group $G$. We prove this correspondence when $G$ is Abelian and provide evidence for the general case by studying the quantum double model for $G=S_3$. We also use our method to construct \emph{anchoring domain walls}, which are novel exotic domain walls in the 3d toric code that transform point-like excitations to semi-loop-like excitations anchored on these domain walls.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum logic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel computation enables multiple processors to execute different parts of a task simultaneously, improving processing speed and efficiency. In quantum computing, parallel gate implementation involves executing gates independently in different registers, directly impacting the circuit depth, the number of sequential quantum gate operations, and thus the algorithm execution time. This work examines a method for reducing circuit depth by introducing auxiliary qubits to enable parallel gate execution, potentially enhancing the performance of quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices. We show that any circuit on $n$ qubits with depth $O\left(M n^2\right)$, where $M = M(n)$ is some function of $n$, can be transformed into a circuit with depth $O\left(\log_2(M) n^2\right)$ operating on $O\left(M n\right)$ qubits. This technique may be particularly useful in noisy environments, where recent findings indicate that only the final $O\left(\log n\right)$ layers influence the expectation value of observables. It may also optimize Trotterization by exponentially reducing the number of Trotter steps. Additionally, the method may offer advantages for distributed quantum computing, and the intuition of treating quantum states as gates and operators as vectors used in this work may have broader applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Fast and Automated Optical Polarization Compensation of Fiber Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of light is critical in various applications, including quantum communication, where the photon polarization encoding a qubit can undergo uncontrolled changes when transmitted through optical fibers. Bends in the fiber, internal and external stresses, and environmental factors cause these polarization changes, which lead to errors and therein limit the range of quantum communication. To prevent this, we present a fast and automated method for polarization compensation using liquid crystals. This approach combines polarimetry based on a rotating quarter-waveplate with high-speed control of the liquid-crystal cell, offering high-fidelity compensation suitable for diverse applications. Our method directly solves for compensation parameters, avoiding reliance on stochastic approaches or cryptographic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves over 99% fidelity within an average of fewer than six iterations, with further fine-tuning to reach above 99.5% fidelity, providing a robust solution for maintaining precise polarization states in optical systems.</description>

      <title>qHEOM: A Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics Using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such non-unitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm (qHEOM) is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable quantum correlations of dipolar polaritons with micrometer-scale blockade radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extreme yet reconfigurable nonlinear response to a single photon by a photonic system is crucial for realizing a universal two-photon gate, an elementary building block for photonic quantum computing. Yet such a response, characterized by the photon blockade effect, has only been achieved in atomic systems or solid states ones that are difficult to scale up. Here we demonstrate electrically tunable partial photon blockade in dipolar waveguide polaritons on a semiconductor chip, measured via photon-correlations. Remarkably, these "dipolar photons" display a two-orders-of-magnitude stronger nonlinearity compared to unpolarized polaritons, with an extracted dipolar blockade radius up to more than 4 $\mu$m, significantly larger than the optical wavelength, and comparable to that of atomic Rydberg polaritons. Furthermore, we show that the dipolar interaction can be electrically switched and locally configured by simply tuning the gate voltage. Finally we show that with a simple modification of the design, a full photon blockade is expected, setting a new route towards scalable, reconfigurable, chip-integrated quantum photonic circuits with strong two-photon nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Empowering Large Scale Quantum Circuit Development: Effective Simulation of Sycamore Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum systems using classical computing equipment has been a significant research focus. This work demonstrates that circuits as large and complex as the random circuit sampling (RCS) circuits published as a part of Google's pioneering work [4-7] claiming quantum supremacy can be effectively simulated with high fidelity on classical systems commonly available to developers, using the universal quantum simulator included in the Quantum Rings SDK, making this advancement accessible to everyone. This study achieved an average linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.678, indicating a strong correlation with ideal quantum simulation and exceeding the XEB values currently reported for the same circuits today while completing circuit execution in a reasonable timeframe. This capability empowers researchers and developers to build, debug, and execute large-scale quantum circuits ahead of the general availability of low-error rate quantum computers and invent new quantum algorithms or deploy commercial-grade applications.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework for maze solving using quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical framework for identifying the shortest path in a maze using a Grover walk, which becomes non-unitary by introducing absorbing holes. In this study, we define the maze as a network with vertices connected by unweighted edges. Our analysis of the stationary state of the Grover walk on finite graphs, where we strategically place absorbing holes and self-loops on specific vertices, demonstrates that this approach can effectively solve mazes. By setting arbitrary start and goal vertices in the underlying graph, we obtain the following long-time results: (i) in tree structures, the probability amplitude is concentrated exclusively along the shortest path between start and goal; (ii) in ladder-like structures with additional paths, the probability amplitude is maximized near the shortest path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pure multipartite quantum state is called absolutely maximally entangled if all reductions of no more than half of the parties are maximally mixed. However, an $n$-qubit absolutely maximally entangled state only exists when $n$ equals $2$, $3$, $5$, and $6$. A natural question arises when it does not exist: which $n$-qubit pure state has the largest number of maximally mixed $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$-party reductions? Denote this number by $Qex(n)$. It was shown that $Qex(4)=4$ in [Higuchi et al.Phys. Lett. A (2000)] and $Qex(7)=32$ in [Huber et al.Phys. Rev. Lett. (2017)]. In this paper, we give a general upper bound of $Qex(n)$ by linking the well-known Tur\'an's problem in graph theory, and provide lower bounds by constructive and probabilistic methods. In particular, we show that $Qex(8)=56$, which is the third known value for this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex numbers are widely used in quantum physics and are indispensable components for describing quantum systems and their dynamical behavior. The resource theory of imaginarity has been built recently, enabling a systematic research of complex numbers in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop two theoretical methods for quantifying imaginarity, motivated by recent progress within resource theories of entanglement and coherence. We provide quantifiers of imaginarity by the convex roof construction and quantifiers of the imaginarity by the least imaginarity of the input pure states under real operations. We also apply these tools to study the state conversion problem in resource theory of imaginarity.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic steganography based on wide field diamond quantum microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate magnetic steganography using wide field quantum microscopy based on diamond nitrogen vacancy centers. The method offers magnetic imaging capable of revealing concealed information otherwise invisible with conventional optical measurements. For a proof of principle demonstration of the magnetic steganography, micrometer structures designed as pixel arts, barcodes, and QR codes are fabricated using mixtures of magnetic and nonmagnetic materials, nickel and gold. We compare three different imaging modes based on the changes in frequency, linewidth, and contrast of the NV electron spin resonance, and find that the last mode offers the best quality of reconstructing hidden magnetic images. By simultaneous driving of the NV qutrit states with two independent microwave fields, we expediate the imaging time by a factor of three. This work shows potential applications of quantum magnetic imaging in the field of image steganography.</description>

      <title>PowerMove: Optimizing Compilation for Neutral Atom Quantum Computers with Zoned Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom-based quantum computers (NAQCs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing, largely due to their advanced hardware capabilities, particularly qubit movement and the zoned architecture (ZA). However, fully leveraging these features poses significant compiler challenges, as it requires addressing complexities across gate scheduling, qubit allocation, qubit movement, and inter-zone communication. In this paper, we present PowerMove, an efficient compiler for NAQCs that enhances the qubit movement framework while fully integrating the advantages of ZA. By recognizing and leveraging the interdependencies between these key aspects, PowerMove unlocks new optimization opportunities, significantly enhancing both scalability and fidelity. Our evaluation demonstrates an improvement in fidelity by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art methods, with execution time improved by up to 3.46x and compilation time reduced by up to 213.5x. We will open-source our code later to foster further research and collaboration within the community.</description>

      <title>Quantum Indistinguishable Obfuscation via Quantum Circuit Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing solutions are increasingly deployed in commercial environments through delegated computing, especially one of the most critical issues is to guarantee the confidentiality and proprietary of quantum implementations. Since the proposal of general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and functional encryption schemes, iO has emerged as a seemingly versatile cryptography primitive. Existing research on quantum indistinguishable obfuscation (QiO) primarily focuses on task-oriented, lacking solutions to general quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a scheme for constructing QiO via the equivalence of quantum circuits. It introduces the concept of quantum subpath sum equivalence, demonstrating that indistinguishability between two quantum circuits can be achieved by incremental changes in quantum subpaths. The restriction of security loss is solved by reducing the distinguisher to polynomial probability test. The scheme obfuscates the quantum implementation of classical functions in a path-sum specification, ensuring the indistinguishability between different quantum implementations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of indistinguishability obfuscation for general circuits and provide novel insights on intellectual property protection and secure delegated quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Volume-law entanglement fragmentation of quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy in quasiparticle states where certain unit patterns are excited repeatedly and sequentially in momentum space. We find that in the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement, leading to a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. This characteristic of volume-law entanglement fragmentation is numerically confirmed in both fermionic and bosonic chains. We derive an analytical formula for fermions, which can also be applied to the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Design of an FPGA-Based Neutral Atom Rearrangement Accelerator for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms have emerged as a promising technology for implementing quantum computers due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, the execution frequency of neutral atom quantum computers is constrained by image processing procedures, particularly the assembly of defect-free atom arrays, which is a crucial step in preparing qubits (atoms) for execution. To optimize this assembly process, we propose a novel quadrant-based rearrangement algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy and also enables the simultaneous movement of multiple atoms, even across different columns and rows. We implement the algorithm on FPGA to handle each quadrant independently (hardware-level optimization) while maximizing parallelization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hardware acceleration work for atom rearrangement, and it significantly reduces the processing time. This achievement also contributes to the ongoing efforts of tightly integrating quantum accelerators into High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Tested on a Zynq RFSoC FPGA at 250 MHz, our hardware implementation is able to complete the rearrangement process of a 30$\times$30 compact target array, derived from a 50$\times$50 initial loaded array, in approximately 1.0 $\mu s$. Compared to a comparable CPU implementation and to state-of-the-art FPGA work, we achieved about 54$\times$ and 300$\times$ speedups in the rearrangement analysis time, respectively. Additionally, the FPGA-based acceleration demonstrates good scalability, allowing for seamless adaptation to varying sizes of the atom array, which makes this algorithm a promising solution for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Variational learning of integrated quantum photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits play a crucial role in implementing quantum information processing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Variational learning is a promising avenue that leverages classical optimization techniques to enhance quantum advantages on NISQ devices. However, most variational algorithms are circuit-model-based and encounter challenges when implemented on integrated photonic circuits, because they involve explicit decomposition of large quantum circuits into sequences of basic entangled gates, leading to an exponential decay of success probability due to the non-deterministic nature of photonic entangling gates. Here, we present a variational learning approach for designing quantum photonic circuits, which directly incorporates post-selection and elementary photonic elements into the training process. The complicated circuit is treated as a single nonlinear logical operator, and a unified design is discovered for it through variational learning. Engineering an integrated photonic chip with automated control, we adjust and optimize the internal parameters of the chip in real time for task-specific cost functions. We utilize a simple case of designing photonic circuits for a single ancilla CNOT gate with improved success rate to illustrate how our proposed approach works, and then apply the approach in the first demonstration of quantum stochastic simulation using integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limit to cavity linewidth narrowing with single atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a quantum interference phenomenon capable of altering the optical response of a medium, turning an initially opaque atomic sample into transparent for a given radiation field (probe field) upon the incidence of a second one (control field). EIT presents several applications, for instance, considering an atomic system trapped inside an optical cavity, its linewidth can be altered by adjusting the control field strength. For the single-atom regime, we show that there is a fundamental limit for narrowing the cavity linewidth, since quantum fluctuations cannot be disregarded in this regime. With this in mind, in this work we also investigate how the linewidth of an optical cavity behaves for different numbers of atoms trapped inside it, which shows a quantum signature in a strong atom-field coupling regime. In addition, we examine how the other system parameters affect the linewidth, such as the Rabi frequency of the control and the probe fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-precision solution of Dirac equation by numerically solving the minmax two-center Dirac equation with the finite element method (FEM). The minmax FEM provide a highly accurate benchmark result for systems with light or heavy atomic nuclear charge $Z$. A result is shown for the molecular ion ${\rm H}_2^+$ and the heavy quasi-molecular ion ${\rm Th}_2^{179+}$, with estimated fractional uncertainties of $\sim 10^{-23}$ and $\sim 10^{-21}$, respectively. The result of the minmax-FEM high-precision of the solution of the two-center Dirac equation, allows solid control over the required accuracy level and is promising for the application and extension of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is a powerful theoretical tool for assessing the suitability of quantum materials as platforms for novel technologies. In particular, the modeling of quantum cycles allows us to investigate the heat changes and work extraction at the nanoscale, where quantum effects dominate over classical ones. In this Review, we cover the mathematical formulation used to model the quantum thermodynamic behavior of small-scale systems, building up the quantum analog versions of thermodynamic processes and reversible cycles. We discuss theoretical results obtained after applying this approach to model Heisenberg-like spin systems, which are toy models for metal complex systems. In addition, we discuss recent experimental advances in this class of materials that have been achieved using the quantum thermodynamic approach, paving the way for the development of quantum devices. Finally, we point out perspectives to guide future efforts in using quantum thermodynamics as a reliable and effective approach to establish metal complex systems as quantum materials for energy storage/harvesting purposes.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Tensor Networks with Magic State Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work augments the recently introduced Stabilizer Tensor Network (STN) protocol with magic state injection, reporting a new framework with significantly enhanced ability to simulate circuits with an extensive number of non-Clifford operations. Specifically, for random $T$-doped $N$-qubit Clifford circuits the computational cost of circuits prepared with magic state injection scales as $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(N))$ when the circuit has $t \lesssim N$ $T$-gates compared to an exponential scaling for the STN approach, which is demonstrated in systems of up to $200$ qubits. In the case of the Hidden Bit Shift circuit, a paradigmatic benchmarking system for extended stabilizer methods with a tunable amount of magic, we report that our magic state injected STN framework can efficiently simulate $4000$ qubits and $320$ $T$-gates. These findings provide a promising outlook for the use of this protocol in the classical modelling of quantum circuits that are conventionally difficult to simulate efficiently.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Compiling via Gauge Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement-based architecture is a paradigm of quantum computing, relying on the entanglement of a cluster of qubits and the measurements of a subset of it, conditioning the state of the unmeasured output qubits. While methods to map the gate model circuits into the measurement-based are already available via intermediate steps, we introduce a new paradigm for quantum compiling directly converting any quantum circuit to a class of graph states, independently from its size. Such method relies on the stabilizer formalism to describe the register of the input qubits. An equivalence class between graph states able to implement the same circuit is defined, giving rise to a gauge freedom when compiling in the MBQC frame. The graph state can be rebuilt from the circuit and the input by employing a set of graphical rules similar to the Feynman's ones. A system of equations describes the overall process. Compared to Measurement Calculus, the ancillary qubits are reduced by 50% on QFT and 75% on QAOA.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of its unbroken ${\cal PT}-$symmetry, the popular imaginary cubic oscillator Hamiltonian $H^{(IC)}=p^2+{\rm i}x^3$ does not satisfy all of the necessary postulates of quantum mechanics. The failure is due to the ``intrinsic exceptional point'' (IEP) features of $H^{(IC)}$ and, in particular, to the phenomenon of a high-energy asymptotic parallelization of its bound-state-mimicking eigenvectors. In the paper it is argued that the operator $H^{(IC)}$ (and the like) can only be interpreted as a manifestly unphysical, singular IEP limit of a hypothetical one-parametric family of certain standard quantum Hamiltonians. For explanation, an ample use is made of perturbation theory and of multiple analogies between IEPs and conventional Kato's exceptional points.</description>

Abstract: A review of the nonlocal electromagnetic response functions of the degenerate electron gas, computed within standard perturbation theory, is given. These expressions due to Lindhard, Klimontovich and Silin are used to re-analyze the classical Casimir interaction between two thick conducting plates (zero'th term of Matsubara series). Up to small corrections that we discuss, the results of the conventional Drude model are confirmed. The difference between longitudinal and transverse permittivities (or polarization tensors) yields the Landau (orbital) diamagnetism of the electron gas.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic robustness of entanglement in noisy quantum networks and graph connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks are promising venues for quantum information processing. This motivates the study of the entanglement properties of the particular multipartite quantum states that underpin these structures. In particular, it has been recently shown that when the links are noisy two drastically different behaviors can occur regarding the global entanglement properties of the network. While in certain configurations the network displays genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) for any system size provided the noise level is below a certain threshold, in others GME is washed out if the system size is big enough for any fixed non-zero level of noise. However, this difference has only been established considering the two extreme cases of maximally and minimally connected networks (i.e. complete graphs versus trees, respectively). In this article we investigate this question much more in depth and relate this behavior to the growth of several graph theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity of the graph sequence that codifies the structure of the network as the number of parties increases. The strongest conditions are obtained when considering the degree growth. Our main results are that a sufficiently fast degree growth (i.e. $\Omega(N)$, where $N$ is the size of the network) is sufficient for asymptotic robustness of GME, while if it is sufficiently slow (i.e. $o(\log N)$) then the network becomes asymptotically biseparable. We also present several explicit constructions related to the optimality of these results.</description>

      <title>Sequential Quantum Maximum Confidence Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential quantum information processing may lie in the peaceful coexistence of no-go theorems on quantum operations, such as the no-cloning theorem, the monogamy of correlations, and the no-signalling principle. In this work, we investigate a sequential scenario of quantum state discrimination with maximum confidence, called maximum-confidence discrimination, which generalizes other strategies including minimum-error and unambiguous state discrimination. We show that sequential state discrimination with equally high confidence can be realized only when positive-operator-valued measure elements for a maximum-confidence measurement are linearly independent; otherwise, a party will have strictly less confidence in measurement outcomes than the previous one. We establish a tradeoff between the disturbance of states and information gain in sequential state discrimination, namely, that the less a party learn in state discrimination in terms of a guessing probability, the more parties can participate in the sequential scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from soft decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, Regev's reduction has been used as a quantum algorithmic tool for providing a quantum advantage for variants of the decoding problem. Following this line of work, the authors of [JSW+24] have recently come up with a quantum algorithm called Decoded Quantum Interferometry that is able to solve in polynomial time several optimization problems. They study in particular the Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) problem, which can be seen as a decoding problem on Reed-Solomon codes. In this work, we provide strong improvements for some instantiations of the OPI problem. The most notable improvements are for the $ISIS_{\infty}$ problem (originating from lattice-based cryptography) on Reed-Solomon codes but we also study different constraints for OPI. Our results provide natural and convincing decoding problems for which we believe to have a quantum advantage. Our proof techniques involve the use of a soft decoder for Reed-Solomon codes, namely the decoding algorithm from Koetter and Vardy [KV03]. In order to be able to use this decoder in the setting of Regev's reduction, we provide a novel generic reduction from a syndrome decoding problem to a coset sampling problem, providing a powerful and simple to use theorem, which generalizes previous work and is of independent interest. We also provide an extensive study of OPI using the Koetter and Vardy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solving the Perfect Domination Problem by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Small Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perfect Domination Problem (PDP), a classical challenge in combinatorial optimization, has significant applications in real-world scenarios, such as wireless and social networks. Over several decades of research, the problem has been demonstrated to be NP-complete across numerous graph classes. With the recent advancements in quantum computing, there has been a surge in the development of quantum algorithms aimed at addressing NP-complete problems, including the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). However, the applicability of quantum algorithms to the PDP, as well as their efficacy in solving it, remains largely unexplored. This study represents a pioneering effort to apply QAOA, with a limited number of layers, to address the PDP. Comprehensive testing and analysis were conducted across 420 distinct parameter combinations. Experimental results indicate that QAOA successfully identified the correct Perfect Dominating Set (PDS) in 82 cases, including 17 instances where the optimal PDS was computed. Furthermore, it was observed that with appropriate parameter settings, the approximation ratio could achieve a value close to 0.9. These findings underscore the potential of QAOA as a viable approach for solving the PDP, signifying an important milestone that introduces this problem into the realm of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing arbitrary unitary transformations is crucial for applications in quantum computing, signal processing, and machine learning. Unitaries govern quantum state evolution, enabling reversible transformations critical in quantum tasks like cryptography and simulation and playing key roles in classical domains such as dimensionality reduction and signal compression. Integrated optical waveguide arrays have emerged as a promising platform for these transformations, offering scalability for both quantum and classical systems. However, scalable and efficient methods for implementing arbitrary unitaries remain challenging. Here, we present a theoretical framework for realizing arbitrary unitary matrices through programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs). We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that cascaded PWAs can implement any unitary matrix within practical constraints, along with a numerical optimization method for customized PWA designs. Our results establish PWAs as a universal and scalable architecture for quantum photonic computing, effectively bridging quantum and classical applications, and positioning PWAs as an enabling technology for advancements in quantum simulation, machine learning, secure communication, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Low loss lumped-element inductors made from granular aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lumped-element inductors are an integral component in the circuit QED toolbox. However, it is challenging to build inductors that are simultaneously compact, linear and low-loss with standard approaches that either rely on the geometric inductance of superconducting thin films or on the kinetic inductance of Josephson junctions arrays. In this work, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the high kinetic inductance offered by superconducting granular aluminum (grAl). We demonstrate lumped-element inductors with a few nH of inductance that are up to $100$ times more compact than inductors built from pure aluminum (Al). To characterize the properties of these linear inductors, we first report on the performance of lumped-element resonators built entirely out of grAl with sheet inductances varying from $30-320\,$pH/sq and self-Kerr non-linearities of $0.2-20\,\mathrm{Hz/photon}$. Further, we demonstrate ex-situ integration of these grAl inductors into hybrid resonators with Al or tantalum (Ta) capacitor electrodes without increasing total internal losses. Interestingly, the measured internal quality factors systematically decrease with increasing room-temperature resistivity of the grAl film for all devices, indicating a trade-off between compactness and internal loss. For our lowest resistivity grAl films, we measure quality factors reaching $3.5 \times 10^6$ for the all-grAl devices and $4.5 \times 10^6$ for the hybrid grAl/Ta devices, similar to state-of-the-art quantum circuits. Our loss analysis suggests that the surface loss factor of grAl is similar to that of pure Al for our lowest resistivity films, while the increasing losses with resistivity could be explained by increasing conductor loss in the grAl film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the strong dispersive coupling to a high-cooperativity cavity, we demonstrate fast and non-destructive number-resolved detection of atoms in optical tweezers. We observe individual atom-atom collisions, quantum state jumps, and atom loss events with a time resolution of $100\ \mu$s through continuous measurement of cavity transmission. Using adaptive feedback control in combination with the non-destructive measurements, we further prepare a single atom with $92(2)\%$ probability.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity and scrambling in quantum annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers play a major role in the ongoing development of quantum information processing and in the advent of quantum technologies. Their functioning is underpinned by the many-body adiabatic evolution connecting the ground state of a simple system to that of an interacting classical Hamiltonian which encodes the solution to an optimization problem. Here we explore more general properties of the dynamics of quantum annealers, going beyond the low-energy regime. We show that the unitary evolution operator describing the complete dynamics is typically highly quantum chaotic. As a result, the annealing dynamics naturally leads to volume-law entangled random-like states when the initial configuration is rotated away from the low-energy subspace. Furthermore, we observe that the Heisenberg dynamics of a quantum annealer leads to extensive operator spreading, a hallmark of quantum information scrambling. In all cases, we study how deviations from chaotic behavior can be identified when analyzing cyclic ramps, where the annealing schedule is returned to the initial configuration.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geometry of Oscillators in Gravity-Induced Entanglement Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of interfacing quantum mechanics and gravity has long been an unresolved issue in physics. Recent advances in precision measurement technology suggest that detecting gravitational effects in massive quantum systems, particularly gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in the oscillator system, could provide crucial empirical evidence for revealing the quantum nature of the gravitational field. However, thermal decoherence imposes strict constraints on system parameters. Specifically, the inequality $2 \gamma_m k_B T &lt; \hbar G \Lambda \rho$ limits the relationship between mechanical dissipation $\gamma_m$, effective temperature $T$, oscillator density $\rho$, form factor $\Lambda$ and fundamental constants. This inequality, based on the GIE's inherent property of noise model, is considered universally across experimental systems and cannot be improved by quantum control. Given the challenges in further optimizing $\gamma_m$, $\rho$, and $T$ near their limits, optimizing the form factor $\Lambda$ may reduce demands on other parameters. This work examines the optimal geometry that maximizes the form factor $\Lambda$. It is mathematically proven that the form factor $\Lambda$, which depends on the geometry and spatial arrangement of the oscillators, has a supremum of $2\pi$ in all geometries and spatial arrangements. This result improves by about one order of magnitude over two spherical oscillators. This establishes a fundamental limit, aiding future experiments and quantum gravitational detection efforts.</description>

      <title>First-principle theory of the Casimir screening effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that in the Gaussian approximation, the contribution of ionic fluctuations is separate from the contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", which was previously used on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to other researchers based on the Lifshitz theory.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum state with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the variationally optimized disentangler corresponds to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, e.g., the Kramer-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of CAMPS as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many properties of Boolean functions can be tested far more efficiently than the function can be learned. However, this advantage often disappears when testers are limited to random samples--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we investigate the quantum version of this scenario: quantum algorithms that test properties of a function $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state for $f$.
  For three well-established properties, we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to samples can be recovered by testers that use quantum data. For monotonicity testing, we give a quantum algorithm that uses $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$ function state copies as compared to the $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ samples required classically. We also present $\mathcal{O}(1)$-copy testers for symmetry and triangle-freeness, comparing favorably to classical lower bounds of $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ and $\Omega(n)$ samples respectively. These algorithms are time-efficient and necessarily include techniques beyond the Fourier sampling approaches applied to earlier testing problems.
  These results make the case for a general study of the advantages afforded by quantum data for testing. We contribute to this project by complementing our upper bounds with a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ for monotonicity testing from quantum data in the proximity regime $\varepsilon\leq\mathcal{O}(n^{-3/2})$. This implies a strict separation between testing monotonicity from quantum data and from quantum queries--where $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ queries suffice when $\varepsilon=\Theta(n^{-3/2})$. We also exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $\mathcal{O}(1)$ classical queries but requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies, complementing a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction derived from the Forrelation problem.</description>

      <title>Erasure Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes via Belief Propagation with Guided Decimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08177v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising family of quantum error-correcting codes for fault tolerant quantum computing with low overhead. Decoding quantum LDPC codes on quantum erasure channels has received more attention recently due to advances in erasure conversion for various types of qubits including neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. Belief propagation with guided decimation (BPGD) decoding of quantum LDPC codes has demonstrated good performance in bit-flip and depolarizing noise. In this work, we apply BPGD decoding to quantum erasure channels. Using a natural modification, we show that BPGD offers competitive performance on quantum erasure channels for multiple families of quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, we show that the performance of BPGD decoding on erasure channels can sometimes be improved significantly by either adding damping or adjusting the initial channel log-likelihood ratio for bits that are not erased. More generally, our results demonstrate BPGD is an effective general-purpose solution for erasure decoding across the quantum LDPC landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>A New Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure: from Qubits to Multiboundary Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Latent Entropy (L-entropy) as a novel measure to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems. Our measure leverages the upper bound of reflected entropy, achieving maximal values for $n$-party 2-uniform states ($n\geq 4$) and GHZ state for 3-party quantum systems. We demonstrate that the measure functions as a multipartite pure state entanglement monotone and briefly address its extension to mixed multipartite states. We then analyze its interesting characteristics in spin chain models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Subsequently, we explore its implications to holography by deriving a Page-like curve for the L-entropy in the CFT dual to a multi-boundary wormhole model. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of L-entropy in Haar random states, deriving analytical expressions and validating them against numerical results. In particular, we show that for $n \geq 5$, random states approximate 2-uniform states with maximal multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we propose a potential connection between random states and multi-boundary wormhole geometries. Extending to finite-temperature systems, we introduce the Multipartite Thermal Pure Quantum (MTPQ) state, a multipartite generalization of the thermal pure quantum state, and explore its entanglement properties. By incorporating state dependent construction of MTPQ state, we resolve the factorization issue in the random average of the MTPQ state, ensuring consistency with the correlation functions in the holographic dual multiboundary wormhole. Finally, we apply this construction to the multi-copy SYK model and examine its multipartite entanglement structure.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the Hilbert space geometry of the eigenstates of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian. In recent years, the QGT and related quantities have found extensive theoretical and experimental utility, in particular for quantifying quantum phase transitions both at and out of equilibrium. Here we consider the symmetric part (quantum Riemannian metric) of the QGT for various multi-parametric random matrix Hamiltonians and discuss the possible indication of ergodic or integrable behaviour. We found for a two-dimensional parameter space that, while the ergodic phase corresponds to the smooth manifold, the integrable limit marks itself as a singular geometry with a conical defect. Our study thus provides more support for the idea that the landscape of the parameter space yields information on the ergodic-nonergodic transition in complex quantum systems, including the intermediate phase.</description>

The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative gauge gravity theories with R-flux star products and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization in algebraic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models naturally arise as star product and R-flux deformations considered in string/ M-theory. Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and quantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as cotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline the analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and dynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general off-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black holes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are constructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV, formalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted star products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de Sitter/affine/ Poincar\'{e} double structure groups. Such theories can be projected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or MGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical and quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative gauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to involve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward identity. Such constructions are elaborated in a nonassociative BV perspective and for developing non-perturbative methods in QG.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points and Stability in Nonlinear Models of Population Dynamics having $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, for example due to environmental gain-loss processes, are a common occurrence throughout numerous areas of science and lie at the root of many remarkable phenomena. For the latter, parity-time-reflection ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry has played an eminent role in understanding exceptional-point structures and phase transitions in these systems. Yet their interplay has remained by-and-large unexplored. We analyze models governed by the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory and related Lotka-Volterra systems of population dynamics. These are foundational nonlinear models that find widespread application and offer a broad platform for non-Hermitian theory beyond physics. In this context we study the emergence of exceptional points in two cases: (a) when the governing symmetry properties are tied to global properties of the models, and, in contrast, (b) when these symmetries emerge locally around stationary states--in which case the connection between the linear non-Hermitian model and an underlying nonlinear system becomes tenuous. We outline further that when the relevant symmetries are related to global properties, the location of exceptional points in the linearization around coexistence equilibria coincides with abrupt global changes in the stability of the nonlinear dynamics. Exceptional points may thus offer a new local characteristic for the understanding of these systems. Tri-trophic models of population ecology serve as test cases for higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory circuit for ion channel dynamics in the nervous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opening or closing mechanism of a voltage-gated ion channel is triggered by the potential difference crossing the cell membrane in the nervous system. Based on this picture, we model the ion channel as a nanoscale two-terminal ionic tunneling junction. External time-varying voltage exerting on the two-terminal ionic tunneling junction mimics the stimulation of neurons from the outside. By deriving the quantum Langevin equation from quantum mechanics, the ion channel current is obtained by the quantum tunneling of ions controlled by the time-varying voltage. The time-varying voltage induces an effective magnetic flux which causes quantum coherence in ion tunnelings and leads to sideband effects in the ion channel current dynamics. The sideband effects in the ionic current dynamics manifest a multi-crossing hysteresis in the I-V curve, which is the memory dynamics responding to the variation of the external voltage. Such memory dynamics is defined as the active quantum memory with respect to the time-varying stimuli. We can quantitatively describe how active quantum memory is generated and changed. We find that the number of the non-zero cross points in the I-V curve hysteresis and the oscillation of the differential conductance are the characteristics for quantitatively describing the active quantum memory. We also explore the temperature dependence of the active quantum memory in such a system. The discovery of this active quantum memory characteristics provides a new understanding about the underlying mechanism of ion channel dynamics.</description>

      <title>Trace formula for quantum chaotic systems with geometrical symmetries and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gutzwiller-type trace formula for quantum chaotic systems that accounts for both particle spin precession and discrete geometrical symmetries. This formula generalises previous results that were obtained either for systems with spin [1,2] or for systems with symmetries [3,4], but not for a combination of both. The derivation requires not only a combination of methodologies for these two settings, but also the treatment of new effects in the form of double groups and spin components of symmetry operations. The resulting trace formula expresses the level density of subspectra associated to irreducible representations of the group of unitary symmetries in terms of periodic orbits in the system's fundamental domain. We also derive a corresponding expression for the spectral determinant. In a follow-up paper [5] we will show that our formula allows to study the impact of geometrical symmetries and spin on spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum systems is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics in a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we study the classical and the quantum H\'enon-Heiles systems. In particular we make a comparison between the classical and the quantum trajectories of the integrable and of the non integrable H\'enon Heiles Hamiltonian. From a classical standpoint, we study theoretically and numerically the form of the invariant curves in the Poincar\'e surfaces of section for several values of the coupling parameter of the integrable case and compare them with those of the non integrable case. Then we study the corresponding Bohmian trajectories and we find that they are chaotic in both cases, but chaos emerges at different times.</description>

      <title>Phase transition analogues in laser collisions with a dark-field setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser pulse collisions are a promising tool for the investigation of light-by-light scattering phenomena induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations. Using the numerical code based on the vacuum emission picture and put forward in Blinne et al. (2019), we observe a strong dependence of the signal features on the transverse profiles of the colliding laser pulses in the interaction region. For a probe beam tailored such as to feature an annular far-field profile and a pronounced on-axis focus peak counterpropagating a pump beam at zero impact parameter, the signal's main emission direction can undergo the analogue of a phase transition with the beam waist ratio of the pulses serving as a control parameter. Depending on the pump's beam profile, this phase transition can be first order (e.g., for a pump with flat top far-field profile) or second order (e.g., for a Gaussian pump). From the simulation data, we determine the critical point and extract the corresponding critical exponent for the second order transition of the main emission direction of the signal in the far field. For this, we improve the performance of the above numerical code, using the phase transition analogues as an example to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the code and current workflows.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.</description>

      <title>MAViS: Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a Modular Automated Virtualization System (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multi-layer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental pillar of quantum mechanics. Probing quantum entanglement and testing Bell inequality with muons can be a significant leap forward, as muon is arguably the only massive elementary particle that can be manipulated and detected over a wide range of energies, e.g., from approximately 0.3 to $10^2$ GeV, corresponding to velocities from 0.94 to nearly the speed of light. In this work, we present a realistic proposal and a comprehensive study of quantum entanglement in a state composed of different-flavor fermions in muon-electron scattering. The polarization density matrix for the muon-electron system is derived using a kinematic approach within the relativistic quantum field theory framework. Entanglement in the resulting muon-electron qubit system and the violation of Bell inequalities can be observed with a high event rate. This paves the way for performing quantum tomography with muons.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Probing false vacuum decay on a cold-atom gauge-theory quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of quantum electrodynamics, the decay of false vacuum leads to the production of electron-positron pair, a phenomenon known as the Schwinger effect. In practical experimental scenarios, producing a pair requires an extremely strong electric field, thus suppressing the production rate and making this process very challenging to observe. Here we report an experimental investigation, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, of the effect of the background field on pair production from the infinite-mass vacuum in a $1+1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory. The ability to tune the background field allows us to study pair production in a large production rate regime. Furthermore, we find that the energy spectrum of the time-evolved observables in the zero mass limit displays excitation peaks analogous to bosonic modes in the Schwinger model. Our work opens the door to quantum-simulation experiments that can controllably tune the production of pairs and manipulate their far-from-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method called the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF) to detect the complex frequency Green's function, $G(\omega\in\mathbb{C})$, in a driven-dissipative system. By utilizing the CFF, we can measure the complex frequency density of states (DOS) and local DOS (LDOS), providing unique insights into the characterization of non-Hermitian systems. By applying our method to systems exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), we demonstrate how to use our theory to detect both the non-Hermitian eigenvalues and eigenstates. This offers a distinctive and reliable approach to identifying the presence or absence of NHSE in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>X-ray Phase Measurements by Time-Energy Correlated Photon Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The invention of X-ray interferometers has led to advanced phase-sensing devices that are invaluable in various applications. These include the precise measurement of universal constants, e.g. the Avogadro number, of lattice parameters of perfect crystals, and phase-contrast imaging, which resolves details that standard absorption imaging cannot capture. However, the sensitivity and robustness of conventional X-ray interferometers are constrained by factors, such as fabrication precision, beam quality, and, importantly, noise originating from external sources or the sample itself. In this work, we demonstrate a novel X-ray interferometric method of phase measurement with enhanced immunity to various types of noise, by extending, for the first time, the concept of the SU(1,1) interferometer into the X-ray regime. We use a monolithic silicon perfect crystal device with two thin lamellae to generate correlated photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Arrival time coincidence and sum-energy filtration allow a high-precision separation of the correlated photon pairs, which carry the phase information from orders-of-magnitude larger uncorrelated photonic noise. The novel SPDC-based interferometric method presented here is anticipated to exhibit enhanced immunity to vibrations as well as to mechanical and photonic noise, compared to conventional X-ray interferometers. Therefore, this SU(1,1) X-ray interferometer should pave the way to unprecedented precision in phase measurements, with transformative implications for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Uniform Continuity Bounds on Entropies in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a variety of new and refined uniform continuity bounds for entropies of both classical random variables on an infinite state space and of quantum states of infinite-dimensional systems. We obtain the first tight continuity estimate on the Shannon entropy of random variables with a countably infinite alphabet. The proof relies on a new mean-constrained Fano-type inequality and the notion of maximal coupling of random variables. We then employ this classical result to derive the first tight energy-constrained continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy of states of infinite-dimensional quantum systems, when the Hamiltonian is the number operator, which is arguably the most relevant Hamiltonian in the study of infinite-dimensional quantum systems in the context of quantum information theory.
  The above scheme works only for Shannon- and von Neumann entropies. Hence, to deal with more general entropies, e.g. $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$, for which continuity bounds are known only for finite-dimensional systems, we develop a novel approximation scheme which relies on recent results on operator H\"older continuous functions and the equivalence of all Schatten norms in special spectral subspaces of the Hamiltonian. This approach is, as we show, motivated by continuity bounds for $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies of random variables that follow from the H\"older continuity of the entropy functionals. Bounds for $\alpha&gt;1$ are provided, too. Finally, we settle an open problem on related approximation questions posed in the recent works by Shirokov on the so-called Finite-dimensional Approximation (FA) property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Markovian master equation that models the evolution of systems subject to driving and control fields. Our approach combines time rescaling and weak-coupling limits for the system-environment interaction with a secular approximation. The derivation makes use of the adiabatic time-evolution operator in a manner that allows for the efficient description of strong driving, while recovering the well-known adiabatic master equation in the appropriate limit. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, firstly we apply it to the paradigmatic case of a two-level (qubit) system subject to a form of periodic driving that remains unsolvable using a Floquet representation and lastly we extend this scenario to the situation of two interacting qubits, the first driven while the second one directly in contact with the environment. We demonstrate the reliability and broad scope of our approach by benchmarking the solutions of the derived reduced time evolution against numerically exact simulations using tensor networks. Our results provide rigorous conditions that must be satisfied by phenomenological master equations for driven systems that do not rely on first-principles derivations.</description>

      <title>Nonclassicality in correlations without causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose antinomicity as a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in the presence of indefinite causality and prove strict inclusions between correlation sets classified by their antinomicity. This article provides a causal perspective on antinomicity, complementing the device-independent perspective adopted in arXiv:2411.11397. Besides providing important background to the results reported in arXiv:2411.11397, including proofs of key technical results, we also define a weight-based measure for the antinomicity of correlations that we term the antinomy weight of a correlation. We then investigate antinomic correlations in bipartite and tripartite scenarios with binary settings and outcomes. In doing so, we discover antinomic correlations that are impossible in the process-matrix framework.</description>

      <title>Hardness results for decoding the surface code with Pauli noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10331v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise, instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit Pauli errors for every qubit.
  In this setting, we show that quantum maximum likelihood decoding (QMLD) and degenerate quantum maximum likelihood decoding (DQMLD) for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for QMLD, and from #SAT for DQMLD, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of approximation results for QMLD and DQMLD. These are worst-case hardness results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely analogous with the known hardness results for QMLD and DQMLD for arbitrary stabilizer codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for solving 0-1 Knapsack problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present two novel contributions for achieving quantum advantage in solving difficult optimisation problems, both in theory and foreseeable practice. (1) We introduce the "Quantum Tree Generator", an approach to generate in superposition all feasible solutions of a given instance, yielding together with amplitude amplification the optimal solutions for 0-1 knapsack problems. The QTG offers massive memory savings and enables competitive runtimes compared to the classical state-of-the-art knapsack solvers (such as COMBO, Gurobi, CP-SAT, Greedy) already for instances involving as few as 100 variables. (2) By introducing a new runtime calculation technique that exploits logging data from the classical solver COMBO, we can predict the runtime of our method way beyond the range of existing quantum platforms and simulators, for various benchmark instances with up to 600 variables. Combining both of these innovations, we demonstrate the QTG's potential practical quantum advantage for large-scale problems, indicating an effective approach for combinatorial optimisation problems.</description>

Abstract: We derive a general method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for exact factorization $|\Psi\rangle=\otimes_p |\psi_p\rangle$ of an eigenstate of a many-body Hamiltonian $H$, based on the quantum covariance matrix of the relevant local operators building the Hamiltonian. The "site" $p$ can be either a single component or a group of subsystems. The formalism is then used to derive exact dimerization and clusterization conditions in spin systems, covering from spin-$s$ singlets and clusters coupled to $0$ total spin to general nonmaximally entangled spin-$s$ dimers (generalized singlets). New results for field induced dimerization in anisotropic $XYZ$ arrays under a magnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ab-initio electronic structure simulations, fermion-to-qubit mappings represent the initial encoding step of the fermionic problem into qubits. This work introduces a physically-inspired method for constructing mappings that significantly simplify entanglement requirements when simulating states of interest. The presence of electronic excitations drives the construction of our mappings, reducing correlations for target states in the qubit space. To benchmark our method, we simulate ground states of small molecules and observe an enhanced performance when compared to classical and quantum variational approaches from prior research employing conventional mappings. In particular, on the quantum side, our mappings require a reduced number of entangling layers to achieve accuracy for $LiH$, $H_2$, $(H_2)_2$, the $H_4$ stretching and benzene's {\pi} system using the RY hardware efficient ansatz. In addition, our mappings also provide an enhanced ground state simulation performance in the density matrix renormalization group algorithm for the $N_2$ molecule.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, a growing interest has been devoted to models of spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction, known also as collapse models. They coherently solve the well-known quantum measurement problem by suitably modifying the Schr\"odinger evolution. Quantum experiments are now finally within the reach of testing such models (and thus testing the limits of quantum theory). Here, we propose a method based on a two-ions confined in a linear Paul trap to possibly enhance the testing capabilities of such experiments. The combination of an atomic and a macromolecular ion provide a good match for the cooling of the motional degrees of freedom and a non-negligible insight in the collapse mechanism, respectively.</description>

Abstract: On-demand storage and retrieval of quantum information in coherent light-matter interfaces is a key requirement for future quantum networking and quantum communication applications. Alkali vapor memories offer scalable and robust high-bandwidth storage at high repetition rates which makes them a natural fit to interface with solid-state single-photon sources. Here, we experimentally realize a room-temperature ladder-type atomic vapor memory that operates on the Cs D1 line. We provide a detailed experimental characterization and demonstration of on-demand storage and retrieval of weak coherent laser pulses with 0.06 photons per pulse at a high signal-to-noise ratio of SNR$=830(80)$. The memory achieves a maximum internal storage efficiency of $\eta_{\text{int}}=15(1)\%$ and an estimated $1/e$-storage time of $\tau_{\mathrm{s}}\approx32\,$ns. Benchmark properties for the storage of single photons from inhomogeneously broadened state-of-the-art solid-state emitters are estimated from the performance of the memory. Together with the immediate availability of high-quality InGaAs quantum dots emitting at 895\,nm, these results provide clear prospects for the development of a heterogeneous on-demand quantum light interface.</description>

Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore how resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong coupling limit to quantum mean force Gibbs state for anharmonic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium state of a quantum system can deviate from the Gibbs state if the system-environment (SE) coupling is not weak. An analytical expression for this mean force Gibbs state (MFGS) is known in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime for the Caldeira-Leggett (CL) model that assumes a harmonic environment. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the MFGS in the USC regime for more general SE models. For all the generalized models considered here, we find the USC state to be diagonal in the basis set by the SE interaction, just like in the CL case. While for the generic model considered, the corresponding USC-MFGS is found to alter from the CL-result, we do identify a class of models more general than the CL model for which the CL-USC result remains unchanged. We also provide numerical verification for our results. These results provide key tools for the study of strong coupling quantum thermodynamics and several quantum chemistry and biology problems under more realistic SE models, going beyond the CL model.</description>

      <title>Probability of Presence Versus $\psi(x,t)^* \psi(x, t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Postulating the identification of $\psi^*(x, t) \psi(x,t)$ with a physical probability density is unsatisfactory conceptually and overly limited practically. For electrons, there is a simple, calculable relativistic correction proportional to $\nabla \psi^* \cdot \nabla \psi$. In particular, zeroes of the wave function do not indicate vanishing probability density of presence. We derive a correction of this kind from a Lagrangian, in a form suitable for wide generalization and use in effective field theories. Thus we define a large new class of candidate models for (quasi-)particles and fields, featuring modified {\it kinetic\/} terms. We solve for the stationary states and energy spectrum in some representative problems, finding striking effects including the emergence of negative effective mass at high energy and of localization by energy. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Entanglement signature in quantum work statistics in the slow-driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In slowly driven classical systems, work is a stochastic quantity and its probability distribution is known to satisfy the work fluctuation-dissipation relation, which states that the mean and variance of the dissipated work are linearly related. Recently, it was shown that generation of quantum coherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis leads to a correction to this linear relation in the slow-driving regime. Here, we go even further by investigating nonclassical features of work fluctuations in setups with more than one system. To do this, we first generalize slow control protocols to encompass multipartite systems, allowing for the generation of quantum correlations during the driving process. Then, focussing on two-qubit systems, we show that entanglement generation leads to a positive contribution to the dissipated work, which is distinct from the quantum correction due to local coherence generation known from previous work. Our results show that entanglement generated during slow control protocols, e.g. as an unavoidable consequence of qubit crosstalk, comes at the cost of increased dissipation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification in Multiple Color Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the complexity and scale of image processing tasks continue to expand, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated the capability to improve image processing performance. These networks can accelerate processing speed and enhance classification accuracy while reducing the number of model parameters. However, these studies restrict images to the RGB color space, and the effectiveness of QCNNs in other color spaces still needs to be explored. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (HQCCNN) model to analyze performance in four different color space images: RGB, Lab, YCrCb, and HSV. Using several multi-qubit entangled gates, HQCCNN is constructed as a parameterized quantum circuit model to evaluate classification performance across these color spaces. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of HQCCNN on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The experimental results show that it achieves significantly greater accuracy in binary classification tasks within the RGB color space. For some superclasses, the model performs in the Lab, YCrCb, and HSV color spaces as well as or better than RGB. This serves as an essential reference for QCNN in processing various color space image data for computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and fidelity response theory of high-fidelity Rydberg entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg CZ gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), downward-corrected for leakage error, which together with our recent work forms a new state-of-the-art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an ab initio error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a fidelity response theory to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with non-trivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the fidelity response theory to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of ${\gtrsim} 0.999$ is feasible with realistic experimental upgrades.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum Markov chains using coherent absorber post-processing and pattern counting estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two step strategy for estimating one-dimensional dynamical parameters of a quantum Markov chain, which involves quantum post-processing the output using a coherent quantum absorber and a "pattern counting'' estimator computed as a simple additive functional of the outcomes trajectory produced by sequential, identical measurements on the output units. We provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that the estimator achieves the quantum Cram\'{e}-Rao bound in the limit of large output size. Our estimation method is underpinned by an asymptotic theory of translationally invariant modes (TIMs) built as averages of shifted tensor products of output operators, labelled by binary patterns. For large times, the TIMs form a bosonic algebra and the output state approaches a joint coherent state of the TIMs whose amplitude depends linearly on the mismatch between system and absorber parameters. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime the TIMs capture the full quantum Fisher information of the output state. While directly probing the TIMs' quadratures seems impractical, we show that the standard sequential measurement is an effective joint measurement of all the TIMs number operators; indeed, we show that counts of different binary patterns extracted from the measurement trajectory have the expected joint Poisson distribution. Together with the displaced-null methodology of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 245304 2024 this provides a computationally efficient estimator which only depends on the total number of patterns. This opens the way for similar estimation strategies in continuous-time dynamics, expanding the results of Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to use universal multiport interferometers' schemes in order to create photonic post-selected Controlled-Z and Controlled-Controlled-Z gates, which are equivalent, modulo single-qubit gates, to Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates, respectively. The new proposed method is based on the following ingredients: identical single photons, Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks, single-photon detectors and post-selection. In particular, by using dual-rail path encoding together with auxiliary paths and single photons, we improve the success probabilities of such gates. This result further proves the complexity and richness of Reck and Clements schemes beyond the usual notions and practices of Boson Sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose for the first time, under the very restrictive linear nearest-neighbour connectivity, $Z\otimes Z \ldots \otimes Z$ exponentials of arbitrary length into circuits of constant depth using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ ancillae and two-body XX and ZZ interactions. Consequently, a similar method works for arbitrary Pauli exponentials. We prove the correctness of our approach, after introducing novel rewrite rules for circuits which benefit from qubit recycling. The decomposition has a wide variety of applications ranging from the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant lattice surgery computations, to expressing arbitrary stabilizer circuits via two-body interactions only, parallel decoding of quantum error-correcting computations and to reducing the depth of NISQ computations, such as VQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study [Phys. Rev. B 17 174111 (2022)] has hypothesized the assembly, along a specific type of one-dimensional defects of diamond, of chains of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, potentially enabling the creation of qubit registers via their dipole-coupled electron spins. Here we investigate the connectivity of chains of up to ten coupled spins, mediated by the bi- and multipartite entanglement of their eigenstates. Rather conveniently, for regularly spaced spins the vast majority of the eigenstates displays strong connectivity, especially towards the center of the spectrum and for longer chains. Furthermore, positional disorder can change, and possibly reduce, the connectivity of the register, but seldom suppresses it.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce homological measurement, a framework for measuring the logical Pauli operators encoded in CSS stabilizer codes. The framework is based on the algebraic description of such codes as chain complexes. Protocols such as lattice surgery some of its recent generalizations are shown to be special cases of homological measurement. Using this framework, we develop a specific protocol called edge expanded homological measurement for fault-tolerant measurement of arbitrary logical Pauli operators of general qLDPC codes, requiring a number of ancillary qubits growing only linearly with the weight of the logical operator measured, and guaranteed that the distance of the code is preserved. We further benchmark our protocol numerically in a photonic architecture based on GKP qubits, showing that the logical error rate of various codes are on par with other methods requiring more ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement in Nanomechanical Resonators through Quantum Squeezing and Parametric Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of squeezed fields assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators while facilitating the transfer of quantum states in a weak coupling, sideband-resolved regime. The mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. Our results show that the degree of mechanical entanglement is strongly influenced by several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate OPA, the squeezing strength of the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity (controlled by laser drive power), and the mechanical bath temperature (phonon thermal excitation). Additionally, our results indicate that careful tuning of these parameters can enhance entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme holds promise for applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods.

      <description>arXiv:2410.20693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical circuit systems, unlike other systems, have the potential to perform quantum information processing (QIP) at higher clock rate than conventional processing. The approach utilizing the electromagnetic field of light allows deterministic QIP by feedforward process, which counteracts the quantum randomness by performing adaptive quantum operation according to the measurement result of an entangled state. However, conventional feedforward with electronic measurement devices has limited the clock rate of the QIP down to around 100 MHz. In this paper, we demonstrate a variable squeezing gate with a clock rate of 1.3 THz by all-optical measurement-device-free feedforward. We utilize a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an optical parametric amplifier, which eliminates the need for electronic measuring devices and enables ultra-fast feedforward. Experimental results demonstrate that our all-optical QIP operates at a THz clock rate, representing a major step toward a true optical quantum computer which opens the curtain to a new era of ultra-fast information processing.</description>

Abstract: We propose ShadowGPT, a novel approach for solving quantum many-body problems by learning from randomized measurement data collected from quantum experiments. The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the transverse-field Ising model and the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning to address complex quantum many-body challenges.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple argument to derive the transformation of quantum stochastic calculus formalism between inertial observers, and derive the quantum open system dynamics for a system moving in a vacuum (more generally coherent) quantum field under the usual Markov approximation. We argue that for uniformly accelerated open systems, however, the formalism must breakdown as we move from a Fock representation of the quantum noise to a unitarily inequivalent non-Fock representation - in particular, the latter is a thermal representation at the Unruh temperature. The unitary inequivalence ultimately being a consequence of the underlying flat noise spectrum approximation for the fundamental quantum stochastic processes.</description>

Abstract: Transitioning from quantum computation on physical qubits to quantum computation on encoded, logical qubits can improve the error rate of operations, and will be essential for realizing valuable quantum computational advantages. Using a neutral atom quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual Ytterbium atom, we demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits using the distance-two [[4,2,2]] code, simultaneously detecting errors and correcting for lost qubits. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded in the [[4,1,2]] code, showing better-than-physical error rates. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation in our approach, guided by the proposal of Gottesman (2016), by performing repeated loss correction for both structured and random circuits encoded in the [[4,2,2]] code. Finally, since distance-two codes can correct qubit loss, but not other errors, we show repeated loss and error correction using the distance-three [[9,1,3]] Bacon-Shor code. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Topological Lattice Model with Strong Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly tunable nature of synthetic quantum materials -- both in the solid-state and cold atom contexts -- invites examining which microscopic ingredients aid in the realization of correlated phases of matter such as superconductors. Recent experimental advances in moir\'e materials suggest that unifying the features of the Fermi-Hubbard model and quantum Hall systems creates a fertile ground for the emergence of such phases. Here, we introduce a minimal 2D lattice model that incorporates exactly these features: time-reversal symmetry, band topology, and strong repulsive interactions. By using infinite cylinder density matrix renormalization group methods (cylinder iDMRG), we investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model. We find that it hosts an interaction-induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and demonstrate that weakly hole-doping this state gives rise to a superconductor at a finite circumference, with indications that this behavior persists on larger cylinders. At the aforementioned circumference, the superconducting phase is surprisingly robust to perturbations including additional repulsive interactions in the pairing channel. By developing a technique to probe the superconducting gap function in iDMRG, we phenomenologically characterize the superconductor. Namely, we demonstrate that it is formed from the weak pairing of holes atop the QSH insulator. Furthermore, we determine the pairing symmetry of the superconductor, finding it to be $p$-wave -- reminiscent of the unconventional superconductivity reported in experiments on twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Motivated by this, we elucidate structural similarities and differences between our model and those of TBG in its chiral limit. Finally, to provide a more direct experimental realization, we detail an implementation of our Hamiltonian in a system of cold fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using bosonization, which maps fermions coupled to a ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge field to a qubit system, we give a simple form for the non-trivial 3-fermion quantum cellular automaton (QCA) as a unitary operator realizing a phase depending on the framing of flux loops, building off work by Shirley et al. We relate this framing dependent phase to a pump of $8$ copies of a $p+ip$ state through the system. We give a resolution of an apparent paradox, namely that the pump is a shallow depth circuit (albeit with tails), while the QCA is nontrivial. We discuss also the pump of fewer copies of a $p+ip$ state, and describe its action on topologically degenerate ground states. One consequence of our results is that a pump of $n$ $p+ip$ states generated by a free Fermi evolution is a free fermion unitary characterized by a non-trivial winding number $n$ as a map from the third homotopy group of the Brilliouin Zone $3$-torus to that of $SU(N_ b)$, where $N_b$ is the number of bands. Using our simplified form of the QCA, we give higher dimensional generalizations that we conjecture are also nontrivial QCAs, and we discuss the relation to Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices with randomly connected boundaries</title>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices, formed by tessellating the hyperbolic plane with regular polygons, exhibit a diverse range of exotic physical phenomena beyond conventional Euclidean lattices. Here, we investigate the impact of disorder on hyperbolic lattices and reveal that the Anderson localization occurs at strong disorder strength, accompanied by the presence of mobility edges. Taking the hyperbolic $\{p,q\}=\{3,8\}$ and $\{p,q\}=\{4,8\}$ lattices as examples, we employ finite-size scaling of both spectral statistics and the inverse participation ratio to pinpoint the transition point and critical exponents. Our findings indicate that the transition points tend to increase with larger values of $\{p,q\}$ or curvature. In the limiting case of $\{\infty, q\}$, we further determine its Anderson transition using the cavity method, drawing parallels with the random regular graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for a comprehensive understanding of Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates in detail the performance and advantages of a new quantum Monte Carlo integrator, dubbed Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), to numerically evaluate for the first time loop Feynman integrals in a near-term quantum computer and a quantum simulator. In order to achieve a quadratic speedup, QFIAE introduces a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) that efficiently decomposes the multidimensional integrand into its Fourier series. For a one-loop tadpole Feynman diagram, we have successfully implemented the quantum algorithm on a real quantum computer and obtained a reasonable agreement with the analytical values. One-loop Feynman diagrams with more external legs have been analyzed in a quantum simulator. These results thoroughly illustrate how our quantum algorithm effectively estimates loop Feynman integrals and the method employed could also find applications in other fields such as finance, artificial intelligence, or other physical sciences.</description>

      <title>A Coherent Theory for Superconductivity through Integration of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory and Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. We propose an integrated theory based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and density functional theory (DFT), suggesting that superconductivity originates from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for electrons and/or holes, which act as resistance-free superhighways, akin to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be predicted by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC through DFT. Our integrated theory highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are part of the bulk material and are easily disrupted by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (Tc). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk material, maintaining stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher Tc. This integrated theory is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor, YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ of $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ and $OUT$ of $\left|\phi\right\rangle$ based on a set of wavefunction measurements (within a phase) $\psi_l \to \phi_l$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} \left|\langle\phi_l|\mathcal{U}|\psi_l\rangle\right|^2$ subject to probability preservation constraints on $\mathcal{U}$ (partial unitarity). The constructed operator $\mathcal{U}$ can be considered as an $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel; it is a partially unitary rectangular matrix (an isometry) of dimension $\dim(OUT) \times \dim(IN)$ transforming operators as $A^{OUT}=\mathcal{U} A^{IN} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. An iterative algorithm for finding the global maximum of this optimization problem is developed, and its application to a number of problems is demonstrated. A software product implementing the algorithm is available from the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Quantum-informed Tensor Adaptation (QuanTA), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient high-rank fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)--low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it was postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, for a neutrino produced by the decay of an unstable particle, these mass eigenstates, if they exist, would be entangled with distinct joint momentum eigenstates of the entire system, composed of all the particles produced by the decay. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which is responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, characterized by strong fluctuations and a wealth of phenomena, emerges as an intriguing state beyond the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the quantum Ising model and Rydberg atom array through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We find two supercritical crossover lines in the quantum phase diagram with universal scaling, $h \propto (g - g_c)^{\beta + \gamma}$, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\beta, \gamma$ are the related critical exponents. Enclosed by the two crossover lines, there exist supercritical quantum states with universal behaviors in correlations and entanglement. In particular, we reveal a dynamical quantum phase transition occurring when traversing the quantum supercritical crossover line. These dynamical singularities, attributed to the intersection of Lee-Yang-Fisher zero lines with the real-time axis, have no counterpart in classical supercriticality. We propose that the Rydberg atom array offers an ideal platform for studying the quantum supercritical crossovers and measuring the critical exponents. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality and related phenomena in correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. Itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find application of magnetic fields up to 14 T below 150 mK induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000% and breaks the signature linear temperature dependences of the heat capacity of both phases. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity are insensitive to applied fields up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range, whereas field depresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% at temperatures below 4 K. These complex phenomena imply applied magnetic field drastically alters the spinons at low temperatures and demand new physics: We propose the steep rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields announces a field-induced localization of spinons.</description>

Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>From $SU(2)$ holonomies to holographic duality via tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Fermionic transport through a driven quantum point contact: breakdown of Floquet thermalization beyond a critical driving frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude. Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various driving protocols and interparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pseudo-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

      <title>On the fermionic van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate fermionic versions, for any number of spatial dimensions, of the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions, and study their properties. In both cases, the systems we introduce contain localized `atoms': two-level systems, coupled to a vacuum Dirac field. This Dirac field plays here a role akin to the electromagnetic field in the van der Waals case. In this context, bag-model conditions for the Dirac field serve as the analog of the 'mirror' in the Casimir-Polder effect. We found that, in this case, the resulting interaction is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Architectural Patterns for Designing Quantum Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. Our review uncovered several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. These insights have been compiled into a catalog of architectural patterns. Each pattern realises a trade-off between efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability and deployability, and other software quality attributes.</description>
