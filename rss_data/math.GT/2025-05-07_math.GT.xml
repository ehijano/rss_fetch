      <title>Torus decomposition and foliation detected slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be knot manifolds and $M=M_1\cup_f M_2$ be the closed 3-manifold obtained by gluing up $M_1$ and $M_2$ via $f:\partial M_1\xrightarrow{\cong} \partial M_2$. We show that if $M$ admits a co-oriented taut foliation, then $f$ identifies some CTF-detected rational boundary slopes of $M_1$ and $M_2$, affirming a conjecture proposed by Boyer, Gordon and Hu.</description>

      <title>Flip-graphs of non-orientable filling surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a surface $\Sigma$ with punctures that serve as marked points and at least one marked point on each boundary component. We build a filling surface $\Sigma_n$ by singling out one of the boundary components and denoting by $n$ the number of marked points it contains. We consider the triangulations of $\Sigma_n$ whose vertices are the marked points and the associated flip-graph $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$. Quotienting $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$ by the homeomorphisms of $\Sigma$ that fix the privileged boundary component results in a finite graph $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$. Bounds on the diameter of $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$ are available when $\Sigma$ is orientable and we provide corresponding bounds when $\Sigma$ is non-orientable. We show that the diameter of this graph grows at least like $5n/2$ and at most like $4n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. If $\Sigma$ is an unpunctured M\"obius strip, $\mathcal{MF}(\Sigma_n)$ coincides with $\mathcal{F}(\Sigma_n)$ and we prove that the diameter of this graph grows exactly like $5n/2$ as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Measured foliations at infinity of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\lambda^+(M),\lambda^-(M))$ denote the pair of measured foliations at the boundary at infinity $\partial_\infty$ of a quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. We prove that $(\lambda^+(M),\lambda^-(M))$ is filling if $M$ is close to being Fuchsian. We also show that given any filling pair $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ of measured foliations, and every small enough $t&gt;0$, the pair $(t\alpha_1,t\alpha_2)$ is realised as the pair of measured foliations at infinity of some quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. This answers questions of Schlenker near the Fuchsian locus.</description>

      <title>Complementary legs and symplectic rational balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterize when a small Seifert fibered space with complementary legs symplectically bounds a rational homology ball in the case $e_0\leq -1$, and we establish strong obstructions for other values of $e_0$. Our results highlight a sharp contrast with the smooth category, where many more such Seifert fibered spaces are known to bound smooth rational homology balls. We also complete the classification of contact structures on spherical $3$-manifolds with either orientations that admit symplectic rational homology ball fillings.</description>

      <title>Correction to: Curvature growth of some 4-dimensional gradient Ricci soliton singularity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note corrects an error in the proof of Proposition 13 in arXiv:1903.09181 and simultaneously establishes a more general result. We prove that if $M$ is a compact 4-manifold with boundary $\partial M$ a rational homology 3-sphere, and if an unbounded number of disjoint copies of $M$ embed in a compact 4-manifold $N$, then $H_1(\partial M;\mathbb{Z})$ is a direct double. This partially generalizes a theorem of Hantzsche in the case of rational homology 3-spheres.</description>

      <title>Computing colored Khovanov homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincar\'e series of the skein lasagna module of $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. With a technical condition for a definite Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <title>Cutting directed ribbon graphs and recursion for volumes of the combinatorial moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study metric ribbon graphs, in particular, directed metric ribbon graphs. These ribbon graphs are dual to bipartite maps and appear in the context of Abelian differentials. We prove that it is possible to decompose a directed ribbon graph into a family of ribbon graphs with one vertex, by performing surgeries along appropriate multi curves. The decomposition is canonical and we call it acyclic decomposition due to a condition on the stable graphs that encode the surgeries. This result provides a recursion scheme for volumes of moduli space of directed metric ribbon graphs, we give explicitly the recursion in the case of four valent metric ribbon graphs. In a particular case, we give applications to count of Grothendieck dessins d'enfants.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz existence problem and fiber products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With each holomorphic map $f: R \rightarrow \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$, where $R$ is a compact Riemann surface, one can associate a combinatorial datum consisting of the genus $g$ of $R$, the degree $n$ of $f$, the number $q$ of branching points of $f$, and the $q$ partitions of $n$ given by the local degrees of $f$ at the preimages of the branching points. These quantities are related by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and the Hurwitz existence problem asks whether a combinatorial datum that fits this formula actually corresponds to some map $f$. In this paper, using results and techniques related to fiber products of holomorphic maps between compact Riemann surfaces, we prove a number of results that enable us to uniformly explain the non-realizability of many previously known non-realizable branch data, and to construct a large amount of new such data. We also deduce from our results the theorem of Halphen, proven in 1880, concerning polynomial solutions of the equation $A(z)^a+B(z)^b=C(z)^c$, where $a,b,c$ are integers greater than one.</description>

      <title>The Kervaire conjecture and the minimal complexity of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kervaire conjecture asserts that adding a generator and then a relator to a nontrivial group always results in a nontrivial group. We introduce new methods from stable commutator length to study this type of problems about nontriviality of one-relator quotients. Roughly, we show that surfaces in certain HNN extensions bounding a given word have complexity no less than the complexity of its boundary. A consequence of this is a Freiheitssatz theorem for HNN extensions, which in particular implies and gives a new proof of Klyachko's theorem that confirms the Kervaire conjecture for torsion-free groups. As another application, we also generalize the following theorem of Klyachko-Lurye to HNN extensions: For any group $G$ and the quotient $Q$ of $G\star\mathbb{Z}$ by any proper power $w^m$ with $w\in G\star\mathbb{Z}$ projecting to $1\in\mathbb{Z}$, the natural map $G\to Q$ is injective.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the number of envy-free divisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze lower bounds for the number of envy-free divisions, in the classical Woodall-Stormquist setting and in a non-classical case, when envy-freeness is combined with the equipartition of a measure.
  1. In the first scenario, there are $r$ hungry players, and the cake (that is, the segment $[0,1]$) is cut into $r$ pieces. Then there exist at least two different envy-free divisions. This bound is sharp: for each $r$, we present an example of preferences such that there are exactly two envy-free divisions.
  2. In the second (hybrid) scenario, there are $p$ not necessarily hungry players ($p$ is a prime) and a continuous measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]$. The cake is cut into $2p-1$ pieces, the pieces are allocated to $p$ boxes (with some restrictions) and the players choose the boxes. Then there exists at least $\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \cdot 2^{2-p}$ envy-free divisions such that the measure $\mu$ is equidistributed among the players.</description>
