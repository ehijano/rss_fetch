      <title>"Stumbling-to-Fetters" mechanism and Virginia Creeper model in hydrogel for designing bionic cardiovascular system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing hydrogels with identical electrochemical properties are typically riddled with unresolved inquiries and challenges. Here, we utilized ultra-light graphene flakes to trace the influence of convection phenomena during reactions on hydrogels' formation and structural non-uniformity, elucidating its mechanisms. Furthermore, we confirmed that an external electric field induced the orientation of functional groups of hydrogels along the direction of this field, revealing the mechanism of its influence on the structural non-uniformity and electrochemical properties of hydrogels. Additionally, we discovered that ion diffusion was "Stumbling-to-Fetters" by the functional groups on the polymer chains within the hydrogel, unveiling this mechanism and developing the Virginia Creeper (VC) model for hydrogels. We demonstrated the scalability and application of the VC model. Furthermore, we proposed a molecular-ion diffusion and current decay equation to describe the electrochemical properties of hydrogels. As an application of the VC model, we developed a bionic cardiovascular system and proved its potential to seamlessly interface with living organisms and generate bio-like bioelectricity. Our findings provide novel insights into triboelectricity and guidance for producing hydrogels with identical electrochemical properties, and offer a new pathway for bioelectric generation and the design of new hydrogel devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic compatibility of actives encapsulated into PEG-PLA nanoparticles: In Silico predictions and experimental verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving optimal solubility of active substances in polymeric carriers is of fundamental importance for a number of industrial applications, including targeted drug delivery within the growing field of nanomedicine. However, its experimental optimization using a trial-and-error approach is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, an approach based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the Flory-Huggins theory is proposed for rapid prediction of thermodynamic compatibility between active species and copolymers comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. In contrast to similar methods, our approach offers high computational efficiency by employing MD simulations that avoid explicit consideration of the actual copolymer chains. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated for compatibility predictions between pyrene and nile red as model dyes as well as indomethacin as model drug and copolymers containing blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(lactic acid) in different ratios. The results of the simulations are directly verified by comparison with the observed encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles prepared by nanoprecipitation.</description>

      <title>Computing the thermal transport coefficient of neutral amorphous polymers using exact vibrational density of states: Comparison with experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport coefficient $\kappa$ is an important property that often dictates broad applications of a polymeric material, while at the same time its computation remains challenging. In particular, classical simulations overestimate $\kappa$ than the experimentally measured $\kappa^{\rm exp}$ and thus hinder their meaningful comparison. This is even when very careful simulations are performed using the most accurate empirical potentials. A key reason for such a discrepancy is because polymers have quantum--mechanical, nuclear degrees--of--freedom whose contribution to the heat balance is non--trivial. In this work, two semi--analytical approaches are considered to accurately compute $\kappa$ by using the exact vibrational density of states $g(\nu)$. The first approach is based within the framework of the minimum thermal conductivity model, while the second uses computed quantum heat capacity to scale $\kappa$. Computed $\kappa$ of a set of commodity polymers compares quantitatively with $\kappa^{\rm exp}$.</description>

      <title>The surface tension of Martini 3 water mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Martini model, a coarse-grained forcefield for biomolecular simulations, has experienced a vast increase in popularity in the past decade. Its building-block approach balances computational efficiency with high chemical specificity, enabling the simulation of various organic and inorganic molecules. The modeling of coarse-grained beads as Lennard-Jones particles poses challenges for the accurate reproduction of liquid-vapour interfacial properties, which are crucial in various applications, especially in the case of water. The latest version of the forcefield introduces refined interaction parameters for water beads, tackling the well-known artefact of Martini water freezing at room temperature. Additionally, multiple sizes of water beads are available for simulating the solvation of small cavities, including the smallest pockets of proteins. This work focuses on studying the interfacial properties of Martini water, including surface tension, surface thickness, and bulk densities for the liquid and vapour phases. Employing the test-area method, we systematically compute the liquid-vapour surface tension across various combinations of water bead sizes and for temperatures in the range from 300 to 350 K. Our findings provide a comprehensive characterization of Martini 3.0 water intefacial properties. These findings are of interest to the Martini community as they allow users to account for the low interfacial tension of Martini water by properly adjusting observables computed via coarse-grained simulations (e.g., capillary forces) to allow for accurate matching against all-atom or experimental results. Surface tension data are also interpreted in terms of local enrichment of the various mixture components at the liquid-vapour interface by means of Gibbs' adsorption formalism</description>

      <title>Fracture metamaterials with on-demand crack paths enabled by bending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scenarios -- when we bite food or during a crash -- fracture is inevitable. Finding solutions to steer fracture to mitigate its impact or turn it into a purposeful functionality, is therefore crucial. Strategies using composites, changes in chemical composition or crystal orientation, have proven to be very efficient, but the crack path control remains limited and has not been achieved in load-bearing structures. Here, we introduce fracture metamaterials consisting of slender elements whose bending enables large elastic deformation as fracture propagates. This interplay between bending and fracture enables tunable energy dissipation and the design of on-demand crack paths of arbitrary complexity. To this end, we use topology optimisation to create unit cells with anisotropic fracture energy, which we then tile up to realize fracture metamaterials with uniform density that we 3D-print. The thin ligaments that constitute the unit cells confer them a strikingly distinct response in tension and shear, and we show that by controlling the orientation and layout of the unit cells the sequential progress of the crack can be controlled, making the fracture path arbitrarily tortuous. This tortuosity increases the energy dissipation of the metamaterial without changing its stiffness. Using bespoke arrangements of unit cells, metamaterials can have on-demand fracture paths of arbitrary complexity. Our findings bring a new perspective on inelastic deformations in mechanical metamaterials, with potential applications in areas as diverse as the food industry, structural design, and for shock and impact damping.</description>

      <title>Collapse/expansion dynamics and actuation of pH-responsive nanogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) hydrogels can dynamically respond to external stimuli, such as changes in pH and temperature, which benefits their use for smart materials and nanodevices with tunable properties. We investigate equilibrium conformations and phase transition dynamics of pH-responsive nanogels using hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations with full consideration of electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions. We demonstrate that PE nanogels exhibit a closed-loop phase behavior with a discontinuous swelling--collapse transition that occurs only at intermediate pH values. A 50~nm nanogel particle close to a critical point functions as a pH-driven actuator with a microsecond conformational response and work density $\approx 10^5~\mathrm{J/m}^3$, an order of magnitude larger than skeletal muscles. The collapse/expansion time scales as $L^{2}$ and the power density scales as $L^{-2}$ where $L$ is the linear size of the gel. Our work provides fundamental insight into phase behavior and non-equilibrium dynamics of the swelling--collapse transition, and our method enables the investigation of charge--structure--hydrodynamic coupling in soft materials.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>

      <title>Donnan equilibrium in charged slit-pores from a hybrid nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics / Monte Carlo method with ions and solvent exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion partitioning between different compartments (\emph{e.g.} a porous material and a bulk solution reservoir), known as Donnan equilibrium, plays a fundamental role in various contexts such as energy, environment, or water treatment. The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, capturing the thermal motion of the ions with mean-field electrostatic interactions, is practically useful to understand and predict ion partitioning, despite its limited applicability to conditions of low salt concentrations and surface charge densities. Here, we investigate the Donnan equilibrium of coarse-grained dilute electrolytes confined in charged slit-pores in equilibrium with a reservoir of ions and solvent. We introduce and use an extension to confined systems of a recently developed hybrid nonequilibrium molecular dynamics / grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation method ("H4D"), which enhances the efficiency of solvent and ion-pair exchange via a fourth spatial dimension. We show that the validity range of linearized PB theory to predict the Donnan equilibrium of dilute electrolytes can be extended to highly charged pores, by simply considering \textit{renormalized} surface charge densities. We compare with simulations of implicit solvent models of electrolytes and show that in the low salt concentrations and thin electric double layer limit considered here, an explicit solvent has a limited effect on the Donnan equilibrium and that the main limitations of the analytical predictions are not due to the breakdown of the mean-field description, but rather to the charge renormalization approximation, because it only focuses on the behavior far from the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic Rheology and Stress Heterogeneity in confined Granular suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the impact of boundary confinement on the shear-thickening rheology of dense granular suspensions. Under highly confined conditions, dense suspensions were found to exhibit size-dependent or even rarely reported non-monotonic ($S$-shaped) flow curves in steady states. By performing in-situ boundary stress microscopy measurements, we observed enhanced flow heterogeneities in confined suspensions, where concentrated high-stress domains propagated stably either along or against the shear direction. By comparing the boundary stress microscopy results with macroscopic flow responses, we revealed the connection between non-monotonic rheology and stress heterogeneity in confined suspensions. These findings suggest the possibility of controlling suspension rheology by imposing different boundary confinements.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low kinetic friction between ice and numerous counterbodies is commonly attributed to an interfacial water layer, which is believed to originate from pre-existing surface water or from melt water induced by high contact pressures or frictional heat. However, even the currently leading theory of frictional melting appears to defy direct experimental verification. Here we present molecular simulations of ice interfaces that reveal that ice surfaces liquefy without melting thermodynamically but mostly by cold, displacement-driven amorphization, as implied in the idiom constant dripping wears the stone. In fact, the ratio of wear and shear rate for ice at -10{\deg}C is even smaller than that of Niagara Falls averaged over one year. Despite efficient self-lubrication, small ice friction coefficients as observed during the sliding of hydrophobic solids over ice, appear possible only when the counterfaces are smooth and allow water to slip past them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equations of motion are developed for the oscillatory rotation of a disk suspended between twisted strings kept under tension by a hanging mass, to which additional forces may be applied. In the absence of forcing, damped harmonic oscillations are observed to decay with an exponential time envelope for two different string types. This is consistent with damping caused by string viscosity, rather than air turbulence, and may be quantified in terms of a quality factor. To test the proposed equation of motion and model for viscous damping within the string, we measure both the natural oscillation frequency and the quality factor for widely varied values of string length, string radius, disk moment of inertia, and hanging mass. The data are found to scale in good accord with predictions. A variation where rotational kinetic energy is converted back and forth to spring potential energy is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-dependent forcing and work per cycle required to drive sinusoidal spinning of a taut-line buzzer is analytically derived, both on and off resonance, from the nonlinear equation of motion. To test predictions, a model experimental system is constructed and characterized in terms of contraction versus twist angle and damped oscillations. The predicted force profile is then approximately implemented by hand. Nearly sinusoidal motion is observed, and the energy injection per cycle needed to maintain steady state oscillations is found to agree with theory. Additional force profiles are implemented, one to maximize non-sinusoidal response and one to maximize the response per operator effort. With the latter, an Aluminum disk of radius 5~cm and height 0.95~cm was spun at a peak speed of over 11,000~RMP for fifteen minutes. The corresponding hand-powered centrifuge system would required $1.5\times$ more force, twice the power, and triple the time in order to run $90\times$ more samples than prior state-of-art.</description>

Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>The Role of a Diluent in Deformation-Induced Bonding of Glassy Polymer Bidisperse Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bonding between polymers below the glass transition temperature through molecular-scale dilatation (or densification)-based interdiffusion of macromolecules has recently been introduced. In this mechanism, short timeframe plastic deformation enables polymer chains to interdiffuse and form entanglements at the interface, facilitating rapid bonding below the glass transition temperature ($T_g$). Here, we are addressing the role of a lower molecular weight diluent in bonding polymer interfaces of bidisperse blends through deformation-induced bonding (DIB) at temperatures well below both the surface and bulk glass transition temperatures, $T_g^s$ and $T_g^b$, respectively, by using molecular simulations. These simulations reveal that addition of the diluent ($\phi\le$20\%) drastically enhances the number of chain-ends at the interfacial region compared to a pure glass sample ($\phi=0\%$) during deformation below $T_g^s$, which improves the possibility of opposite side entanglement formation. The changes in stress-strain response of debonded samples correlate with the normalized entanglement density. Likewise, the maximum interfacial fracture energy $G_{I,max}$ of debonded samples is correlated with the diluent concentration ($\phi$), below $T_g^s$. Furthermore, the optimization of material and process conditions for DIB has yielded a notable advancement for the conditions tested here: achieving a higher bonding strength, approximately one-third of the bulk, all while remaining below $T_g$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

Abstract: This study explores reduced-order modeling for analyzing the time-dependent diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the finite element method. We employ proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. The reduced-order model performance is tested through a benchmark problem on hydrogel swelling and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Then, we embed the reduced-order model into an optimization loop to efficiently identify the coupled problem's material parameters using full-field data. Finally, a study is conducted on the uncertainty propagation of the material parameter.</description>
