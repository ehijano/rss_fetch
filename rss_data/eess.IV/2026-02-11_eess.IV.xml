      <title>Operator-Based Information Theory for Imaging: Entropy, Capacity, and Irreversibility in Physical Measurement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging systems are commonly described using resolution, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio, but these quantities do not provide a general account of how physical transformations affect the flow of information. This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways. The results provide a general structure for analysing the physical limits of imaging and form the basis for subsequent work on information geometry, spatiotemporal budgets, nonlinear channels, and reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>SAS-Net: Scene-Appearance Separation Network for Robust Spatiotemporal Registration in Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional scanning enables rapid functional brain imaging but introduces severe spatiotemporal
  misalignment from coupled scan-direction-dependent domain shift and geometric distortion. Conventional registration methods rely on brightness constancy, an assumption
  violated under bidirectional scanning, leading to unreliable alignment. A unified scene-appearance separation framework is proposed to jointly address domain shift and
  spatial misalignment. The proposed architecture separates domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific appearance characteristics, enabling cross-domain
  reconstruction with geometric preservation. A scene consistency loss promotes geometric correspondence in the latent space, linking domain shift correction with spatial
  registration within a single framework. For in vivo mouse brain vasculature imaging, the proposed method achieves normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of 0.961 and
  structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.894, substantially outperforming conventional methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that domain alignment loss is critical,
  with its removal causing 82% NCC reduction (0.961 to 0.175), while scene consistency and cycle consistency losses provide complementary regularization for optimal
  performance. The method achieves 11.2 ms inference time per frame (86 fps), substantially exceeding typical OR-PAM acquisition rates and enabling real-time processing.
  These results suggest that the proposed framework enables robust high-speed bidirectional OR-PAM for reliable quantitative and longitudinal functional imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAS-Net</description>

      <title>Smaller is Better: Generative Models Can Power Short Video Preloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preloading is widely used in short video platforms to minimize playback stalls by downloading future content in advance. However, existing strategies face a tradeoff. Aggressive preloading reduces stalls but wastes bandwidth, while conservative strategies save data but increase the risk of playback stalls. This paper presents PromptPream, a computation powered preloading paradigm that breaks this tradeoff by using local computation to reduce bandwidth demand. Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies.</description>

      <title>Camel: Frame-Level Bandwidth Estimation for Low-Latency Live Streaming under Video Bitrate Undershooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency live streaming (LLS) has emerged as a popular web application, with many platforms adopting real-time protocols such as WebRTC to minimize end-to-end latency. However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls.
  To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss.
  We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Intensity-based Segmentation of Tissue Images Using a U-Net with a Pretrained ResNet-34 Encoder: Application to Mueller Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual annotation of the images of thin tissue sections remains a time-consuming step in Mueller microscopy and limits its scalability. We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>In-Hospital Stroke Prediction from PPG-Derived Hemodynamic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems offer significant potential for improving healthcare delivery in humanitarian and resource-constrained environments, providing essential services to underserved populations in remote areas. However, limited network infrastructure in such regions makes reliable communication challenging for traditional IoT systems. This paper presents a real-time chest X-ray decision support system designed for hospitals in remote locations. The proposed system integrates a fine-tuned ResNet50 deep learning model for disease classification with Fast DDS real-time middleware to ensure reliable and low-latency communication between healthcare practitioners and the inference system. Experimental results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 88.61%, precision of 88.76%, and recall of 88.49%. The system attains an average throughput of 3.2 KB/s and an average latency of 65 ms, demonstrating its suitability for deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments. These results highlight the effectiveness of DDS-based middleware in enabling real-time medical decision support for remote healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Targeted Unlearning Using Perturbed Sign Gradient Methods With Applications On Medical Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs. Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>ECGFlowCMR: Pretraining with ECG-Generated Cine CMR Helps Cardiac Disease Classification and Phenotype Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging provides a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function but remains constrained by high acquisition costs and reliance on expert annotations, limiting the availability of large-scale labeled datasets. In contrast, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely accessible, and offer a promising modality for conditioning the generative synthesis of cine CMR. To this end, we propose ECGFlowCMR, a novel ECG-to-CMR generative framework that integrates a Phase-Aware Masked Autoencoder (PA-MAE) and an Anatomy-Motion Disentangled Flow (AMDF) to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the cross-modal temporal mismatch between multi-beat ECG recordings and single-cycle CMR sequences, and (2) the anatomical observability gap due to the limited structural information inherent in ECGs. Extensive experiments on the UK Biobank and a proprietary clinical dataset demonstrate that ECGFlowCMR can generate realistic cine CMR sequences from ECG inputs, enabling scalable pretraining and improving performance on downstream cardiac disease classification and phenotype prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms leading baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video editing-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leakage, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.</description>
