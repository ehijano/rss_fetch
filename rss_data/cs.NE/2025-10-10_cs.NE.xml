      <title>A Digital Pheromone-Based Approach for In/Out-of-Control Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control (OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences, representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics, imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and predictive maintenance in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Neuron Dynamics within Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general, parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.</description>

      <title>A Rotation-Invariant Embedded Platform for (Neural) Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rotation-invariant embedded platform for simulating (neural) cellular automata (NCA) in modular robotic systems. Inspired by previous work on physical NCA, we introduce key innovations that overcome limitations in prior hardware designs. Our platform features a symmetric, modular structure, enabling seamless connections between cells regardless of orientation. Additionally, each cell is battery-powered, allowing it to operate independently and retain its state even when disconnected from the collective. To demonstrate the platform's applicability, we present a novel rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape classification. The proposed system provides a robust foundation for exploring the physical realization of NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic systems and self-organizing structures. Our implementation, including hardware, software code, a simulator, and a video, is openly shared at: https://github.com/dwoiwode/embedded_nca</description>

      <title>Co-design is powerful and not free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control. Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability, control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware robot design.</description>

      <title>DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15876v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning.

      <title>AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone, formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and self-representation is visual-silent ($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy $\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\ A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer, $\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the highest intelligent good.</description>

      <title>A Modality-Aware Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Framework for Multimodal Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE) dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours, outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing computation cost by 27%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into optical spiking neural networks (SNNs) has primarily focused on spiking devices, networks of excitable lasers or numerical modelling of large architectures, often overlooking key constraints such as limited optical power, crosstalk and footprint. We introduce SEPhIA, a photonic-electronic, multi-tiled SNN architecture emphasizing implementation feasibility and realistic scaling. SEPhIA leverages microring resonator modulators (MRMs) and multi-wavelength sources to achieve effective sub-one-laser-per-spiking neuron efficiency. We validate SEPhIA at both device and architecture levels by time-domain co-simulating excitable CMOS-MRR coupled circuits and by devising a physics-aware, trainable optoelectronic SNN model, with both approaches utilizing experimentally derived device parameters. The multi-layer optoelectronic SNN achieves classification accuracies over 90% on a four-class spike-encoded dataset, closely comparable to software models. A design space study further quantifies how photonic device parameters impact SNN performance under constrained signal-to-noise conditions. SEPhIA offers a scalable, expressive, physically grounded solution for neuromorphic photonic computing, capable of addressing spike-encoded tasks.</description>

      <title>Multidomain Evolutionary Optimization on Combinatorial Problems in Complex Networks</title>

Abstract: Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization has garnered significant attention, such as in multi-task evolutionary optimization (MTEO), which aims to solve complex problems by simultaneously optimizing multiple tasks. While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Be Trusted as Evolutionary Optimizers for Network-Structured Combinatorial Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15081v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based EVO. Our findings present perspectives on integrating LLMs into evolutionary computation and discuss paths that may support scalable and context-aware optimization in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLM+PDDL Symbolic Plans with Human Objective Specifications through Evolutionary Algorithm Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated planning using a symbolic planning language, such as PDDL, is a general approach to producing optimal plans to achieve a stated goal. However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly. We account for this using an evolutionary approach to generate a population of symbolic goal specifications with slight differences from the initial translation, and utilize a trained LSTM-based validation model to assess whether each induced plan in the population adheres to the natural language specifications. We evaluate our approach on a collection of prototypical specifications in a notional naval disaster recovery task, and demonstrate that our evolutionary approach improve adherence of generated plans to natural language specifications when compared to plans generated using only LLM translations. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/owenonline/PlanCritic.</description>

Abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</description>

      <title>Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and &gt;90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.</description>
