      <title>Bistability in filamentous actin through monomer-sequestration of an effector species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentous actin, a species of dynamic protein polymers, is one of the main components of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. We formulate a class of models that predict the possibility of bistable steady states in populations of dynamic actin filaments. They are built upon a basic model of actin dynamics that includes severing and capping in the presence of a finite actin monomer pool. The key additional ingredient is the presence of a single species of effector molecules that is partially sequestered to an inactive state by binding to free G-actin. In its unbound active state, this effector species can \emph{enhance} the rate of nucleation of filamentous actin or its growth speed, or \emph{inhibit} the activity of capping or severing proteins. Using an explicit analytical solution of the basic actin dynamics model, we show that bistability is predicted to occur in all of the proposed models. We verify these predictions using particle-based stochastic simulations. In addition, we show that switching between the two stable states can be achieved by transient manipulation of the free G-actin pool size.</description>

      <title>SIU: A Million-Scale Structural Small Molecule-Protein Interaction Dataset for Unbiased Bioactivity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecules play a pivotal role in modern medicine, and scrutinizing their interactions with protein targets is essential for the discovery and development of novel, life-saving therapeutics. The term "bioactivity" encompasses various biological effects resulting from these interactions, including both binding and functional responses. The magnitude of bioactivity dictates the therapeutic or toxic pharmacological outcomes of small molecules, rendering accurate bioactivity prediction crucial for the development of safe and effective drugs. However, existing structural datasets of small molecule-protein interactions are often limited in scale and lack systematically organized bioactivity labels, thereby impeding our understanding of these interactions and precise bioactivity prediction. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive dataset of small molecule-protein interactions, consisting of over a million binding structures, each annotated with real biological activity labels. This dataset is designed to facilitate unbiased bioactivity prediction. We evaluated several classical models on this dataset, and the results demonstrate that the task of unbiased bioactivity prediction is challenging yet essential.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Therapy: Reframing SBDD Model Evaluation via Practical Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in structure-based drug design (SBDD) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and precision of drug discovery by generating molecules tailored to bind specific protein pockets. Despite these technological strides, their practical application in real-world drug development remains challenging due to the complexities of synthesizing and testing these molecules. The reliability of the Vina docking score, the current standard for assessing binding abilities, is increasingly questioned due to its susceptibility to overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes assessing the similarity of generated molecules to known active compounds, introducing a virtual screening-based metric for practical deployment capabilities, and re-evaluating binding affinity more rigorously. Our experiments reveal that while current SBDD models achieve high Vina scores, they fall short in practical usability metrics, highlighting a significant gap between theoretical predictions and real-world applicability. Our proposed metrics and dataset aim to bridge this gap, enhancing the practical applicability of future SBDD models and aligning them more closely with the needs of pharmaceutical research and development.</description>

      <title>RGFN: Synthesizable Molecular Generation Using GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</description>

      <title>Scoreformer: A Surrogate Model For Large-Scale Prediction of Docking Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present ScoreFormer, a novel graph transformer model designed to accurately predict molecular docking scores, thereby optimizing high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) in drug discovery. The architecture integrates Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Learnable Random Walk Positional Encodings (LRWPE), enhancing the model's ability to understand complex molecular structures and their relationship with their respective docking scores. This approach significantly surpasses traditional HTVS methods and recent Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in both recovery and efficiency due to a wider coverage of the chemical space and enhanced performance. Our results demonstrate that ScoreFormer achieves competitive performance in docking score prediction and offers a substantial 1.65-fold reduction in inference time compared to existing models. We evaluated ScoreFormer across multiple datasets under various conditions, confirming its robustness and reliability in identifying potential drug candidates rapidly.</description>

      <title>ESM All-Atom: Multi-scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ESM-AA (ESM All-Atom), a novel approach that enables atom-scale and residue-scale unified molecular modeling. ESM-AA achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ESM-AA surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ESM-AA not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins. The source codes of ESM-AA are publicly released at https://github.com/zhengkangjie/ESM-AA.</description>
