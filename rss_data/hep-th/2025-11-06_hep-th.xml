      <title>Entanglement inequalities, black holes and the architecture of typical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR &gt; L_UV. Degrees of freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the ultraviolet (scales &lt; L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales &gt; L_IR). Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated, and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the corona and the outer horizon.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the Conformal Manifold of Holographic CFT$_{2}$s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of conformal manifolds around AdS$_3 \times S^3$ which lift from continuous flat directions in the scalar potential of gauged supergravity resulting from six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity. Our approach combines numerical exploration and symbolic inference. For the latter, we develop a symbolic regression algorithm based on Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo samplers, a combination of Annealed Importance Sampling and Sequential Monte Carlo samplers, well-suited to uncovering polynomial constraints in high-dimensional parameter spaces. The algorithm reconstructs a set of polynomial relations that provides an explicit analytic parametrization of a new family of solutions.</description>

      <title>Platonic solutions of the discrete Nahm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete Nahm equation is an integrable nonlinear difference equation for complex $N\times N$ matrices defined on a one-dimensional lattice, with rank and symmetry boundary conditions at the ends of the lattice. Solutions of this system correspond to $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles of charge $N$ in hyperbolic space, with the curvature related to the number of lattice points. Here some solutions of the discrete Nahm equation are obtained by imposing platonic symmetries, and the spectral curves of the associated hyperbolic monopoles are calculated directly from these solutions.</description>

      <title>BPS phases and fortuity in higher spin holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the BPS states of $U(N)_k\times U(1)_{-k}$ vector Chern-Simons theory on a sphere at weak coupling $\lambda=\frac{N}{k}\ll 1$, dual to an AdS$_4$ higher spin gravity. Higher spin currents are well known to be anomalous at $\lambda\neq 0$. We show that these non-BPS higher spin particles form multi-particle `BPS bounds' at low energy, and interpret them as a primordial form of small black hole states. We also construct a new heavy BPS operator at $N=2$. We study the BPS phases of this system from the large $N$ index at Planckian `temperatures'. The deconfined saddles at high temperature exist only above a threshold, similar to the BTZ black holes. The low temperature saddles are given by novel 2-cut eigenvalue distributions. Their phase transition involves subtle issues like the holomorphic anomaly and the background independence, whose studies we initiate. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the critical temperature by studying the eigenvalue instantons.</description>

      <title>Joule-Thomson expansion for quantum corrected AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom black holes in Kiselev spacetime with Barrow fractal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we detect the difference in the effects of the quantum corrections included in the metric of a spacetime and the quantum corrections included in the entropy of such a system? Recently, J. Barrow designed an expression based directly on black hole (BH) entropy of Bekenstein-Hawking where the geometry of the event horizon can also have an intricate, non smooth, structure, a fractal geometry. These fractal features are represented by a numerical constant parameter, the fractal parameter (FP). Since then, several interesting issues have been explored in the literature. In this work, we investigate the inversion temperature connected to the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom BH by using the Barrow entropy equation where the FP has several values within a certain validity interval. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems also involves numerical solutions concerning the FP. The results are shown by temperature-pressure curves for multiple values of the parameters of the system used here. In conclusion of our analysis, we also show isenthalpic curves corresponding to fixed-mass BH processes, and we respond numerically to the question made in the first line of this abstract.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernels and Resummations: the Spinor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the available perturbative approaches in quantum field theory, heat kernel techniques provide a powerful and geometrically transparent framework for computing effective actions in nontrivial backgrounds. In this work, resummation patterns within the heat kernel expansion are examined as a means of systematically extracting nonperturbative information. Building upon previous results for Yukawa interactions and scalar quantum electrodynamics, we extend the analysis to spinor fields, demonstrating that a recently conjectured resummation structure continues to hold. The resulting formulation yields a compact expression that resums invariants constructed from the electromagnetic tensor and its spinorial couplings, while preserving agreement with known proper-time coefficients. Beyond its immediate computational utility, the framework offers a unified perspective on the emergence of nonperturbative effects (such as Schwinger pair creation) in relation to perturbative heat kernel data, and provides a basis for future extensions to curved spacetimes and non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The heterotic perturbative vacua in string geometry theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory. In this paper, in string geometry theory, we identify perturbative heterotic vacua, which include general heterotic backgrounds. From fluctuations around these vacua, we derive the path-integrals of heterotic perturbative superstrings on the backgrounds up to any order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use equivariant localization and holography to study four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories arising from M5-branes wrapped on a punctured Riemann surface. We explain how, given a Riemann surface with marked points, one can glue in a ``puncture geometry'' locally around each point. Using equivariant localization we show that the central charge consists of a bulk contribution plus localized puncture contributions. We recover and generalize the known results for locally $\mathcal{N}=2$ preserving punctures, and derive new results for genuinely locally $\mathcal{N}=1$ preserving punctures.</description>

      <title>Scrambling or Stalling: Angular Momentum Barriers to Chaos in Holographic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scrambling is a diagnostic of quantum chaos in strongly coupled systems, and plays a central role in the holographic description of black hole dynamics. We study scrambling in high-temperature holographic CFTs, with an emphasis on perturbations dual to particles on infalling and bound trajectories in the bulk description. For BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild geometries, we derive an analytic expression relating the difference in scrambling times to the particles' kinematics. We match this to a 2d CFT computation by constructing the smeared operator that creates the bulk particle with the desired kinematics and calculating the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). For higher-dimensional holographic CFTs, the scrambling slows and eventually ceases when the dual bulk particle has insufficient energy to overcome the angular momentum barrier.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial CFT dual of 4d conformal gravity: I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute tree-level celestial operator product expansions (OPE) in a bosonic sub-sector of the Berkovits-Witten conformal supergravity from the scattering amplitudes in the MHV configuration. While the OPE between a leading soft graviton current for a positive helicity graviton and any of the primary operators exhibits the same singularity structure as in a gravitational theory with two-derivative kinetic terms, the OPE of a subleading soft graviton current with a positive helicity hard graviton primary operator receives corrections, as a consequence of the non-universal nature of the subleading soft graviton theorem in the bulk. Remarkably, the subleading soft graviton terms remain consistent with the Ward identity of the chiral $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R}) $ current algebra, albeit with a different realisation where particle-changing operators play a role. Our analysis suggests that the dual celestial CFT continues to enjoy at least the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ symmetry, though in a non-trivial way, and possibly a conformal extension of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mathematical and physical content of the giant graviton expansion of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theories in a simplifying limit. We uncover an interesting relation between the coefficients in this expansion, the Hilbert series of certain quiver varieties and the representation theory of vertex algebras. In particular, for the worldvolume theory of $N$ M2-branes at the tip of a toric hyper-K\"{a}hler four-fold cone: $X_{4}=\mathbb{C}^2 /{\mathbb{Z}_L} \times \mathbb{C}^2/{\mathbb{Z}_K}$, we derive an explicit expression for the coefficients in terms of affine fermionic forms and show that they coincide with characters of a direct sum of parafermionic W-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of non-Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of stationary axisymmetric non-Killing horizons, which emerge in spacetimes that do not enjoy the symmetry known as circularity -- as is commonly the case for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. Specifically, we define and compute three notions of surface gravity: inaffinity, normal, and peeling; and find that the inaffinity and normal definitions generically differ, while the normal and peeling definitions always agree, although none of them is constant over the horizon. We then derive a version of Smarr's formula, which appears to involve an average over the horizon of the normal surface gravity. We also compute, via the tunnelling method, the spectrum of Hawking's radiation, verifying that its temperature is controlled by the (non-constant) peeling surface gravity. Finally, we recapitulate the status of the four laws of black hole mechanics in situations in which the event horizon fails to be Killing. Our results thus pave the way to a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Quantum Field Theory version of the higher derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. We quantize canonically this system and construct its Fock space, as well as study its path integral. We demonstrate that the inclusion of canonical coordinates in the path integral necessarily introduces a new field, a Lagrange multiplier, which is essential for the consistent application of these coordinates in the canonical quantization framework. Finally, we analyze the improved ultraviolet convergence of the Green functions that this theory exhibits in the presence of an interaction.</description>

      <title>Studying the thermoelectric properties of an anisotropic QGP medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied how the thermoelectric properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are affected by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising from the asymptotic expansion of matter in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The highly energetic medium produced in such collisions exhibits a notable temperature difference between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient induces an electric field whose magnitude per unit temperature gradient, in the limit of vanishing electric current, defines the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. We have calculated the Seebeck coefficient for both individual quark flavors and the entire QGP medium in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory framework. The partonic interactions are incorporated through their effective thermal masses within the quasiparticle model for an anisotropic QGP medium. We have observed that the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the entire QGP medium increases in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy, indicating a stronger induced electric field in the anisotropic medium compared to the isotropic case. Given that an increase in the Seebeck coefficient may lead to observable signatures such as charge asymmetries in particle distributions and to modifications in the transport behavior of the QGP, these results may provide useful input for future phenomenological studies investigating the internal structure and phase properties of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Wormhole spacetimes in an expanding universe: energy conditions and future singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However, once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike, allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.</description>

      <title>A superintegrable quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G\'erard and Grellier proposed, under the name of the cubic Szeg\H{o} equation, a remarkable classical field theory on a circle with a quartic Hamiltonian. The Lax integrability structure that emerges from their definition is so constraining that it allows for writing down an explicit general solution for prescribed initial data, and at the same time, the dynamics is highly nontrivial and involves turbulent energy transfer to arbitrarily short wavelengths. The quantum version of the same Hamiltonian is even more striking: not only the Hamiltonian itself, but also its associated conserved hierarchies display purely integer spectra, indicating a structure beyond ordinary quantum integrability. Here, we initiate a systematic study of this quantum system by presenting a mixture of analytic results and empirical observations on the structure of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, conservation laws, ladder operators, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Oscillon decay via parametric resonance: the case of three-point scalar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the decay dynamics of oscillons through interactions with an external scalar field. To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point interaction $g_3\phi\chi^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external field $\chi$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes. Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.</description>

      <title>Inertial Repulsion from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We review some definitions and basic notions relating to generalised spin structures and introduce the notion of reducibility. We discuss connections on these structures, define a covariant Lie derivative for associated bundles and develop a covariant Cartan calculus. We introduce an extension of the Lie algebra of Killing vectors, the symmetry algebra, and show that it has a representation on sections of associated bundles. We discuss homogeneous generalised spin structures and provide a characterisation of them in terms of lifts of the isotropy representation.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M &lt;&lt; 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.</description>

      <title>Two-loop form factors for Dark Matter annihilation to colored Standard Model particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a UV-complete model in which the dark matter (DM) particle interacts with gluons through a colored scalar mediator. This framework provides a phenomenologically viable scenario testable at hadron colliders. While mono-jet signatures are relevant for collider searches, zero-jet processes correspond to complete annihilation of Standard Model (SM) particles into DM, contributing to the relic density. In this work, we study dark matter annihilation into SM colored particles, which in our model arises at leading order from loop-induced processes. We compute the relevant two-loop QCD amplitudes for both gluon and quark channels in dark matter production or annihilation. The amplitudes are decomposed into scalar form factors using the projector technique. Using integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, we obtain analytical expressions for the form factors in terms of master integrals. Ultraviolet divergences are removed via counterterm renormalization, yielding UV-finite results. These results would enable predictions for dark matter production or annihilation into SM colored particles at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD.</description>

      <title>The Trace Anomaly at Neutron Star Centers: Minimum or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

Abstract: When two particles collide in an asymptotically AdS spacetime with high enough energy and small enough impact parameter, they can form a black hole. Motivated by dual quantum circuit considerations, we propose a threshold condition for black hole formation. Intuitively the condition can be understood as the onset of overlap of the butterfly cones describing the ballistic spread of the effect of the perturbations on the boundary systems. We verify the correctness of the condition in three bulk dimensions. We describe a six-point correlation function that can diagnose this condition and compute it in two-dimensional CFTs using eikonal resummation.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the non-Abelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach that incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that both the running coupling and the gluon propagator remain finite at infrared scales and that the latter shows positivity violations that reflects the presence of massless modes. We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, which we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>

Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

Abstract: We study the large-order behavior of the functional renormalization group (FRG). For a model in dimension zero, we establish Borel-summability for a large class of microscopic couplings. Writing the derivatives of FRG as contour integrals, we express the Borel-transform as well as the original series as integrals. Taking the strong-coupling limit in this representation, we show that all short-ranged microscopic disorders flow to the same universal fixed point. Our results are relevant for FRG in disordered elastic systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive a general formula for the on-shell action of six-dimensional Euclidean Romans supergravity using equivariant localization. Our results are obtained without the need for solving any of the equations of motion, instead working on the assumption of the existence of a solution. We show that the on-shell action is completely determined in terms of the R-symmetry Killing vector and topological data. We easily recover known results in the literature, make predictions for hitherto unknown solutions, and also match to holographic field theory duals.</description>

Abstract: Scattering amplitudes of $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory can be encoded as the canonical form of the Stasheff associahedron. Similarly, the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of the same theory are captured by the recently proposed cosmohedron, a non-simple polytope associated to the Stasheff associahedron; unitarity and locality of the amplitudes and wavefunction coefficients are then encoded in the factorisation properties of faces of these polytopes. In this paper, we argue that these desirable properties of the Stasheff associahedron are shared by a wider class of polytopes called acyclonestohedra and generalise the cosmohedron construction to arbitrary acyclonestohedra.
  Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally, an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby extending recent results for graph associahedra, and construct truncations of acyclonestohedra into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as sections of graph cosmohedra.</description>

Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice and modified energy-momentum relations.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high temperature equilibrium partition function of a massless real scalar field nonminimally coupled to the scalar curvature is computed at second order in the derivative expansion on a generic stationary background. Using covariant perturbation theory, the expression of the thermal partition function at second order in powers of curvatures is also obtained, including its nonlocal contributions. For conformal coupling, the Weyl anomaly at fourth order in derivatives and second order in curvatures is evaluated using both expansions and the results found to be consistent.</description>

      <title>Flat connections at infinity on knot surgery manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on a closed 3-manifold is one of the most interesting, yet tractable examples of a QFT. On one hand, its non-perturbative structure is not yet fully understood; on the other, the mathematical structure turns out to be very rich. In this work we explore the new phenomenon of flat connections at infinity on various knot surgery manifolds. Such flat connections can be understood as asymptotic ends in the non-compact moduli space of flat $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections. We focus on the examples of $\pm 1/r$-surgeries on torus, twist and some double twist knot complements in $S^3$. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that flat connections at infinity are abundant even for simple low-crossing knot surgeries. We therefore believe that their presence would shed light on the resurgent nature of the path integral.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric $\alpha'$-corrections to the Generalized Kerr-Schild Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetric extension of the generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz (gKSA) in Double Field Theory (DFT) including first-order $\alpha'$ corrections. Supersymmetry plays a central role in constraining higher-derivative deformations, and in this work we focus on the structure of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha')$ Killing Spinor Equations (KSEs). Starting from the $\alpha'$-corrected supersymmetry transformations of the fermionic fields, we derive the corresponding KSEs in DFT and analyze their behavior under the gKSA. The generalized Green-Schwarz transformations impose specific constraints on the perturbations that ensure the linearization of the $\alpha'$-corrected KSEs. We then provide the explicit parameterization of the results in terms of the ten-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity fields. Our construction establishes a unified framework for exploring supersymmetric backgrounds in $\alpha'$-corrected DFT and offers new tools for generating higher-derivative supergravity solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sextic tensor model where the interaction terms are given by all $O(N)^3$-invariant bubbles. The class of invariants studied here is thus a larger one that the class of the $U(N)^3$-invariant sextic tensor model. We implement the large $N$ limit mechanism for this general model and we explicitly identify the dominant graphs in the $1/N$ expansion. This class of dominant graphs contains tadpole graphs, melonic graphs but also new types of tensor graphs. Our analysis adapts the tensorial intermediate field method, previously applied only to the prismatic interaction, to all connected sextic interactions except the wheel interaction, which we treat separately using a cycle analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider expansions for the kernels of operator functions of second-order minimal operators on a curved background. We show that the terms of these expansions originate in the ultraviolet or infrared regions. We propose a systematic approach to obtaining ultraviolet terms using term-by-term integration of the DeWitt expansion of the heat kernel. We discuss two methods for regularizing infrared divergences arising at intermediate computational steps -- using analytic continuation and introducing a mass term -- and the relationship between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space-time, we find the singular energy-momentum and spin tensor sources that generate the non-trivial geometry. The energy-momentum tensor is symmetric, conserved and compatible with a spinning massive point particle whose mass and angular velocity we determine. The calculation is based on the analysis of the holonomy for a closed loop around the singularity of the $SO(1,3)$ Chern-Simons gauge field appropriate for gravity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. This holonomy is related, via the non-abelian Stokes theorem, to the singular source terms at the center. Our results may be helpful for a better understanding of the algebra of observables of a local observer in the Kerr-de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <title>Single-Sided Black Holes in Double-Scaled SYK Model and No Man's Island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane behind the horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK). The new Hamiltonian is a deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an extra exponential wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter. There is an alternative but equivalent definition with a $q$-coherent state due to a nontrivial isomorphism of the vN algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism induces a unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial commutant and is a type II$_1$ vN factor. It follows that the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and there is a ``no man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT limit. Inspired by the EoW brane, we construct a family of matter-brane states with an arbitrary number of matter chords and behaving like an EoW brane. They exactly solve the full spectrum of DSSYK.
  We take different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant. We show that the commutant is complex on chord number basis and thus non-geometric. In the semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. In the context of Hawking radiation after Page time, the unitary equivalence is interpreted as encoding the canonical purification into the old Hawking radiation, and the no man's island has the same essence as the island. Including the exponential wormhole length operator independently, the boundary algebra is extended to all bounded operators and reconstructs the no man's island. This can be regarded as a different choice for the definition of boundary algebra. This type I$_\infty$ algebra is closely related to the EoW brane in Kourkoulou-Maldacena.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study Dirac and Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field in the three-flavour case. A theoretical framework developed in \cite{Popov:2019} is extended to the case of three neutrino species, as well as to the Majorana neutrinos case. The closed expression for the Dirac neutrinos flavour and spin oscillations are given. Majorana neutrino oscillations are studied numerically. We show that the probabilities exhibit a complicated interplay of oscillation on magnetic $\mu_\nu B$ and vacuum $\Delta m^2_{ij}/2p$ frequencies. It is also shown that neutrino oscillations in an interstellar magnetic field can modify neutrino fluxes observed in neutrino telescopes.</description>

For this family we prove a skew Schur function expansion formula. For arbitrary rational weight generating functions we construct the multi-matrix models. Two different types of cut-and-join descriptions are derived. Considered examples include generalized fully simple maps, which we identify with the recently introduced skew hypergeometric tau-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave polarization modes in the torsionless spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime and to test gravity theories. These modes extend the standard gravitational wave polarization paradigm and provide novel observational signatures for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</description>

      <title>Searching for gluon saturation effects in the momentum transfer dependence of coherent charmonium electroproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of testing the quantum nature of the gravitational field with an ultracold self-bound quantum droplet of one-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures. To this end, we solve variationally and numerically the underlying generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation which includes the effects of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. We derive the associated generalized uncertainty principle and its corresponding minimal length. The obtained modified uncertainty relation enables us to search for the quantum gravity signatures in both small and large droplets. We place bounds on the parameter using existing experimental data from recent experiment of dilute droplets of potassium. Improved upper bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle parameters are found from our analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that a simple redefinition of the regularizing parameter in regular black hole (RBH) metrics can preserve the self-similarity of the evaporation process. This implies that a RBH can evaporate completely, mirroring the behavior of its singular counterpart. Consequently, RBHs need not evolve into exotic, unverified remnant states such as horizonless compact objects or wormholes. We then provide a generic framework to study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). As illustrative examples, we explicitly work out the cases of the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric. The formalism can be readily applied to other metrics. RPBH generally exhibits different Hawking temperature and horizon size compared to their singular counterpart, leading to distinct lifetime and mass evolution. We calculate the resulting modified cosmological constraints and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance. This intriguing scenario provides a unified resolution to both the DM problem and the black hole singularity problem, while preserving the standard self-similar evaporation process.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>
