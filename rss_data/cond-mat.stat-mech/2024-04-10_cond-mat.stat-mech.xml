      <title>Canonical Temperature Control by Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Pedagogical derivations for Nos\'e's dynamics can be developed in two different ways, (i) by starting with a temperature-dependent Hamiltonian in which the variable $s$ scales the time or the mass, or (ii) by requiring that the equations of motion generate the canonical distribution including a Gaussian distribution in the friction coefficient $\zeta$. Nos\'e's papers follow the former approach. Because the latter approach is not only constructive and simple, but also can be generalized to other forms of the equations of motion, we illustrate it here. We begin by considering the probability density $f(q,p,\zeta)$ in an extended phase space which includes $\zeta$ as well as all pairs of phase variables $q$ and $p$. This density $f(q,p,\zeta)$ satisfies the conservation of probability (Liouville's Continuity Equation)" $$(\partial f/\partial t) + \sum (\partial (\dot q f)/\partial q) + \sum (\partial (\dot p f)/\partial p) + \sum (\partial (\dot \zeta f)/\partial \zeta) = 0 \ . $$ The multi-authored ``review''\cite{b1} motivated our quoting the history of Nos\'e and Nos\'e-Hoover mechanics, aptly described on page 31 of Bill's 1986 {\it Molecular Dynamics} book, reproduced above\cite{b2}.</description>

      <title>The Rosenzweig Porter model revisited for the three Wigner Dyson symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the Rosenzweig Porter model for all symmetry classes of the Dyson threefold way. We analyzed the fluctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectra, and compared them with existing and new analytical results. Based on these results we propose characteristics of the spectral properties as measures to explore the transition from Poisson to Wigner Dyson WD statistics. Furthermore, we performed thorough studies of the properties of the eigenvectors in terms of the fractal dimensions, the Kullback Leibler KL divergences and the fidelity susceptibility. The ergodic and Anderson transitions take place at the same parameter values and a finite size scaling analysis of the KL divergences at the transitions yields the same critical exponents for all three WD classes, thus indicating superuniversality of these transitions.</description>

      <title>Direction of spontaneous processes in non-equilibrium systems with movable/permeable internal walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of equilibrium thermodynamics explains the direction of spontaneous processes in a system after removing internal constraints. When the system only exchanges energy with the environment as heat, the second law states that spontaneous processes at constant temperature satisfy: $\textrm{d} U - \delta Q \leq 0$. Here, $\textrm{d} U$ is the infinitesimal change of the internal energy, and $\delta Q$ is the infinitesimal heat exchanged in the process. We will consider ideal gas, van der Waals gas, and a binary mixture of ideal gases in a heat flow. We will divide each system into two subsystems by a movable wall. We will show that the direction of the motion of the wall, after release, at constant boundary conditions is determined by the same inequality as in equilibrium thermodynamics. The only difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium is the dependence of the net heat change, $\delta Q$, on the state parameters of the system. We will study the influence of the gravitational field. The inequality determining the direction of motion of the internal wall at constant boundary conditions is $\textrm{d} E - \delta Q - \delta W_p \leq 0$, where $\textrm{d} E$ is the change of the total energy (internal and gravitational), and $\delta W_p$ is the infinitesimal work performed by gravity. We will also consider a wall thick and permeable to gas particles and derive Archimedes' principle in the heat flow. Finally, we will study the ideal gas's Couette flow, where the direction of the motion of the internal wall follows from the inequality $\textrm{d} E - \delta Q - \delta W_s \leq 0$, with $\textrm{d} E$ being the infinitesimal change of the total energy (internal and kinetic) and $\delta W_s$ the infinitesimal work exchanged with the environment due to shear force. Ultimately, we will synthesize all these cases in a framework of the second law of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>First-Order Vortex Lattice Melting in Bilayer Ice: A Monte Carlo Method Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the stable bilayer water ice grown in the laboratory (Nature 577, 60, 2020), we propose a model representing water ice as a two-layer six-vertex model. Using the loop update Monte Carlo method, we unveil meaningful findings. While the square lattice six-vertex model exhibits an antiferromagnetic to disordered phase transition known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, we observe a different scenario for the bilayer six-vertex model, where the transition type transforms into an Ising transition. We discover the emergence of vortices in the disordered phase, and to stabilize them, vortex excitation is induced. This leads to the presence of distinct 1/2 filling and 2/3 filling vortex lattice phases. Importantly, we identify the phase transitions between the vortex lattice phase and the disorder phase, as well as between the 1/2 and 2/3 vortex lattices, as being of first order. Our findings provide valuable insights into the nature of phase transitions occurring in layered water ice and artificial spin ice systems in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Correlation decoupling of Casimir interaction in an electrolyte driven by external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description for multicritical Yang-Lee models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and extend Fisher's argument for a Ginzburg-Landau description of multicritical Yang-Lee models in terms of a single boson Lagrangian with potential $\varphi^2 (i \varphi)^n$. We explicitly study the cases of $n=1,2$ by a Truncated Hamiltonian Approach based on the free massive boson perturbed by $\boldsymbol P\boldsymbol T$ symmetric deformations, providing clear evidence of the spontaneous breaking of $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetry. For $n=1$, the symmetric and the broken phases are separated by the critical point corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$, while for $n=2$, they are separated by a critical manifold corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$ with $\mathcal M(2,7)$ on its boundary. Our numerical analysis strongly supports our Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for multicritical Yang-Lee models.</description>

      <title>A look at the operator product expansion in critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the critical relaxation of the Ising model, the so-called model A, and study its operator product expansion. Within perturbation theory, we focus on the operator product expansions of the two-point function and the response function. At the fixed point, we normalize the coefficients and the scaling variables so that the result displays universality. The role of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also discussed, and it is shown that it provides non-perturbative relations among the operator product expansion coefficients. Finally, the large N limit is considered.</description>

      <title>Dynamical critical behavior on the Nishimori point of frustrated Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the quench dynamics of two-dimensional frustrated Ising models through numerical simulations, we investigate the dynamical critical behavior on the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). We calculate several dynamical critical exponents, namely, the relaxation exponent $z_{\rm c}$, the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda_{\rm c}$, and the persistence exponent $\theta_{\rm c}$, after a quench from the high temperature phase to the NP. We confirm their universality with respect to the lattice geometry and bond distribution. For a quench from a power-law correlated initial state to the NP, the aging dynamics are much slower. We also look up the issue of multifractality during the critical dynamics by investigating different moments of the spatial correlation function. We observe a single growth law for all the length scales extracted from different moments, indicating that the equilibrium multifractality at the NP does not affect the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental interactions in self-organized critical dynamics on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In functionally complex systems, higher-order connectivity is often revealed in the underlying geometry of networked units. Furthermore, such systems often show signatures of self-organized criticality, a specific type of non-equilibrium collective behaviour associated with an attractor of internal dynamics with long-range correlations and scale invariance, which ensures the robust functioning of complex systems, such as the brain. Here, we highlight the intertwining of features of higher-order geometry and self-organized critical dynamics as a plausible mechanism for the emergence of new properties on a larger scale, representing the central paradigm of the physical notion of complexity. Considering the time scale of the structural evolution with the known separation of the time scale in self-organized criticality, i.e., internal dynamics and external driving, we distinguish three classes of geometries that can shape the self-organized dynamics on them differently. We provide an overview of current trends in the study of collective dynamics phenomena, such as the synchronization of phase oscillators and discrete spin dynamics with higher-order couplings embedded in the faces of simplicial complexes. For a representative example of self-organized critical behaviour induced by higher-order structures, we present a more detailed analysis of the dynamics of field-driven spin reversal on the hysteresis loops in simplicial complexes composed of triangles. These numerical results suggest that two fundamental interactions representing the edge-embedded and triangle-embedded couplings must be taken into account in theoretical models to describe the influence of higher-order geometry on critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Message Passing Variational Autoregressive Network for Solving Intractable Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many deep neural networks have been used to solve Ising models, including autoregressive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks. Learning a probability distribution of energy configuration or finding the ground states of a disordered, fully connected Ising model is essential for statistical mechanics and NP-hard problems. Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks. Considering these extremely difficult problems to be solved, our method extends the current computational limits of unsupervised neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R\'enyi entropy is a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, which has been used in various fields of physics. Despite its wide applicability, the physical interpretations of the R\'enyi entropy are not widely known. In this paper, we discuss some basic properties of the R\'enyi entropy relevant to physics, in particular statistical mechanics, and its physical interpretations using free energy, replicas, work, and large deviation.</description>

      <title>Coherent Heat Transfer Leads to Genuine Quantum Enhancement in Performances of Continuous Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines, termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Noise induced coherent ergotropy of a quantum heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically identify the noise-induced coherent contribution to the ergotropy of a four-level quantum heat engine coupled to a unimodal quantum cavity. We utilize a protocol where the passive state's quasiprobabilities can be analytically identified from the population-coherence coupled reduced density matrix. The reduced density matrix elements are evaluated using a microscopic quantum master equation formalism. Multiple ergotropies within the same coherence interval, each characterized by a positive and pronounced coherent contribution, are observed. These ergotropies are a result of population inversion as well as quasiprobability-population inversion, controllable through the coherence measure parameters. The optimal flux and power of the engine are found to be at moderate values of ergotropy with increasing values of noise-induced coherence. The optimal power at different coherences is found to possess a constant ergotropy.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization problem. We show that under the assumption that the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) in the solution space for the Max-$q$-XORSAT is a monotonic increasing function, the swapping of limits in QAOA leads to suboptimal results limited by the OGP. Furthermore, since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. A corollary of this is that the spectral gap of a Hamiltonian exhibiting the OGP will close in the thermodynamic limit resulting in a limitation of the quantum adiabatic theorem and efficient optimization of QAOA parameters. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to Montanari's classical algorithm in solving the mean field spin glass problem, the best known classical algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>A Constant self-consistent scattering lifetime in superconducting Strontium Ruthenate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we find a self-consistent constant scattering superconducting lifetime for two different values of the disorder parameters, the inverse atomic strength, and the stoichiometric impurity in the triplet paired unconventional super-conductor strontium ruthenate. This finding is relevant for experimentalists given that the expressions for the ultrasound attenuation and the electronic thermal conductivity depend on the superconducting scattering lifetime, and a constant lifetime fits well nonequilibrium experimental data. Henceforth, this work helps experimentalists in their interpretation of the acquired data. Additionally, we encountered tiny imaginary parts of the self-energy that resembles the Miyake-Narikiyo tiny gap out-side the unitary elastic scattering limit, and below the threshold zero gap value of 1.0 meV.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. In particular, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transitions in topological order induced by boundary decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, predictive machine learning methods have gained prominence in various scientific domains. However, due to their black-box nature, it is essential to establish trust in these models before accepting them as accurate. One promising strategy for assigning trust involves employing explanation techniques that elucidate the rationale behind a black-box model's predictions in a manner that humans can understand. However, assessing the degree of human interpretability of the rationale generated by such methods is a nontrivial challenge. In this work, we introduce interpretation entropy as a universal solution for assessing the degree of human interpretability associated with any linear model. Using this concept and drawing inspiration from classical thermodynamics, we present Thermodynamics-inspired Explainable Representations of AI and other black-box Paradigms (TERP), a method for generating accurate, and human-interpretable explanations for black-box predictions in a model-agnostic manner. To demonstrate the wide-ranging applicability of TERP, we successfully employ it to explain various black-box model architectures, including deep learning Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks, across diverse domains such as molecular simulations, text, and image classification.</description>

      <title>Switching particle systems for foraging ants showing phase transitions in path selections</title>

Abstract: Switching interacting particle systems studied in probability theory are the stochastic processes of hopping particles on a lattice made up of slow and fast particles, where the switching between these types of particles occurs randomly at a given transition rate. This paper explores how such stochastic processes involving multiple particles can model group behaviors of ants. Recent experimental research by the last author's group has investigated how ants switch between two types of primarily relied cues to select foraging paths based on the current situation. Here, we propose a discrete-time interacting random walk model on a square lattice, incorporating two types of hopping rules. Numerical simulation results demonstrate global changes in selected homing paths, transitioning from trailing paths of the `pheromone road' to nearly optimal paths depending on the switching parameters. By introducing two types of order parameters characterizing the dependence of homing duration distributions on switching parameters, we discuss these global changes as phase transitions in ant path selections. We also study critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Oscillator Potential Perturbed by a Combination of Linear and Non-linear Dirac Delta Interactions with Application to Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the bound state analysis of a one dimensional nonlinear version of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator potential perturbed by a $\delta$ potential, where the nonlinear term is taken to be proportional to $\delta(x) |\psi(x)|^2 \psi(x)$. The bound state wave functions are explicitly found and the bound state energy of the system is algebraically determined by the solution of an implicit equation. Then, we apply this model to the Bose-Einstein condensation of a Bose gas in a harmonic trap with a dimple potential. We propose that the many-body interactions of the Bose gas can be effectively described by the nonlinear term in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Then, we investigate the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, and the density profile of this system numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phase is a generalization of symmetry-protected topological phases to disordered systems or open quantum systems. We devise a "strange correlator" in one and two dimensions to detect nontrivial ASPT states. We demonstrate that for a nontrivial ASPT phase this strange correlator exhibits long-range or power-law behavior. We explore the connection between the strange correlators and correlation functions in two-dimensional loop models with quantum corrections, leading to the exact scaling exponents of the strange correlators.</description>

      <title>EPR-Net: Constructing non-equilibrium potential landscape via a variational force projection formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present EPR-Net, a novel and effective deep learning approach that tackles a crucial challenge in biophysics: constructing potential landscapes for high-dimensional non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) systems. EPR-Net leverages a nice mathematical fact that the desired negative potential gradient is simply the orthogonal projection of the driving force of the underlying dynamics in a weighted inner-product space. Remarkably, our loss function has an intimate connection with the steady entropy production rate (EPR), enabling simultaneous landscape construction and EPR estimation. We introduce an enhanced learning strategy for systems with small noise, and extend our framework to include dimensionality reduction and state-dependent diffusion coefficient case in a unified fashion. Comparative evaluations on benchmark problems demonstrate the superior accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of EPR-Net compared to existing methods. We apply our approach to challenging biophysical problems, such as an 8D limit cycle and a 52D multi-stability problem, which provide accurate solutions and interesting insights on constructed landscapes. With its versatility and power, EPR-Net offers a promising solution for diverse landscape construction problems in biophysics.</description>

      <title>Fracton models from product codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a deep connection between fracton order and product codes. In particular, we propose and analyze conditions on classical seed codes which lead to fracton order in the resulting quantum product codes. Depending on the properties of the input codes, product codes can realize either Type-I or Type-II fracton models, in both nonlocal and local constructions. For the nonlocal case, we show that a recently proposed model of lineons on an irregular graph can be obtained as a hypergraph product code. Interestingly, constrained mobility in this model arises only from glassiness associated with the graph. For the local case, we introduce a novel type of classical LDPC code defined on a planar aperiodic tiling. By considering the specific example of the pinwheel tiling, we demonstrate the systematic construction of local Type-I and Type-II fracton models as product codes. Our work establishes product codes as a natural setting for exploring fracton order.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>
