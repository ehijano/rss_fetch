      <title>Green antitrust conundrum: Collusion with social goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent antitrust regulations in several countries have granted exemptions for collusion aimed at achieving environmental goals. Firms can apply for exemptions if collusion helps to develop or to implement costly clean technology, particularly in sectors like renewable energy, where capital costs are high and economies of scale are significant. However, if the cost of the green transition is unknown to the competition regulator, firms might exploit the exemption by fixing prices higher than necessary. The regulator faces the decision of whether to permit collusion and whether to commission an investigation of potential price fixing, which incurs costs. We fully characterise the equilibria in this scenario that depend on the regulator's belief about the high cost of green transition. If the belief is high enough, collusion will be allowed. We also identify conditions under which a regulator's commitment to always investigate price fixing is preferable to making discretionary decisions.</description>

      <title>Allocating Positional Goods: A Mechanism Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the optimal allocation of positional goods with externalities and one-sided transfers. Because consumers care about their relative positions in consumption, allocating an item to one buyer has externalities on others. Using a mechanism design approach, I characterize the externalities by a feasibility condition. I find the revenue-maximizing mechanism excludes some low types and fully separates the rest if and only if the buyer's type distribution satisfies Myerson's regularity. The seller can guarantee at least half the maximal revenue by offering one level of positional goods, and the approximation can be arbitrarily close if the distribution is sufficiently concave. Moreover, if the distribution has an increasing (decreasing) failure rate, total pooling (full separation) without exclusion maximizes the consumer surplus, and the consumer surplus is decreasing (increasing) in the number of positional good levels. Applications include education, priority services, luxury goods, and organizational design.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Screening with Rich Consumer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-product monopolist faces a buyer who is privately informed about his valuations for the goods. As is well-known, optimal mechanisms are in general complicated, while simple mechanisms -- such as pure bundling or separate sales -- can be far from optimal and do not admit clear-cut comparisons. We show that this changes if the monopolist observes sufficiently rich data about the buyer's valuations: Now, pure bundling always outperforms separate sales; moreover, there is a sense in which pure bundling performs essentially as well as the optimal mechanism. To formalize this, we characterize how fast the corresponding revenues converge to the first-best revenue as the monopolist's data grows rich: Pure bundling achieves the same convergence rate to the first-best as optimal mechanisms; in contrast, the convergence rate under separate sales is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>A dynamic auction for multilateral collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of multilateral collaboration among agents with transferable utilities. Any group of agents can sign a contract consisting of a primitive contract and monetary transfers among the signatories. We propose a dynamic auction that finds a stable outcome when primitive contracts are gross complements for all participants.</description>

      <title>Voting behind the Veil of Ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A committee consisting of two factions is considering a project whose distributive consequences are unknown. This uncertainty can be resolved at some unknown future time. By delaying approval, the committee can gradually learn which faction benefits from the project. Because support of both factions is required for approval, it can only happen when there is sufficient amount of uncertainty about the identities of winners and losers. I show that in many situations, a project is more likely to be approved if it gives a lower payoff to everyone. The probability of approval and expected payoffs of both factions are higher if the project is ex ante less likely to benefit the faction that tends to receive good news faster. Equilibrium amount of learning is excessive, and a deadline on adopting the project is often optimal.</description>

      <title>The Shapley index for music streaming platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an index to measure the popularity of artists in music streaming platforms. This index, which can be used to allocate the amount raised via paid subscriptions among participating artists, is based on the Shapley value, a centerpiece in cooperative game theory. We characterize this Shapley index combining several axioms formalizing principles with normative appeal. This permits to place the index in the literature, as an alternative to the well-known (and widely used in the industry) pro-rata and user-centric indices.</description>

      <title>Test-Optional Admissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many U.S. colleges now use test-optional admissions. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college can admit a student body it prefers, say with more diversity. But how can observing less information improve decisions? This paper proposes that test-optional policies are a response to social pressure on admission decisions. We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that "society" dislikes. Going test optional allows the college to reduce its "disagreement cost". We analyze how missing scores are imputed and the consequences for the college, students, and society.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Growth and Land Overvaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical trends suggest the decline in importance of land as a production factor but its continued importance as a store of value. Using an overlapping generations model with land and aggregate uncertainty, we theoretically study the long-run behavior of land prices and identify economic conditions under which land becomes overvalued on the long-run trend relative to the fundamentals defined by the present value of land rents. Unbalanced growth together with the elasticity of substitution between production factors plays a critical role. Around the trend, land prices exhibit recurrent stochastic fluctuations, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation.</description>

      <title>Decision making in stochastic extensive form I: Stochastic decision forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory of stochastic decision forests is developed to bridge two concepts of information flow: decision trees and refined partitions on the one side, filtrations from probability theory on the other. Instead of the traditional "nature" agent, this framework uses a single lottery draw to select a tree of a given decision forest. Each "personal" agent receives dynamic updates from an own oracle on the lottery outcome and makes partition-refining choices adapted to this information. This theory addresses a key limitation of existing approaches in extensive form theory, which struggle to model continuous-time stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, as outcomes of "nature" decision making. Additionally, a class of stochastic decision forests based on time-indexed action paths is constructed, encompassing a wide range of models from the literature and laying the groundwork for an approximation theory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Fair Rank-Minimizing Mechanisms with Agent Refusal Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines strategic issues in fair rank-minimizing mechanisms, which choose an assignment that minimizes the average rank of object types to which agents are assigned and satisfy a fairness property called equal treatment of equals. As one of these fair mechanisms, the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is considered. We focus on the case where agents can refuse their assignment and obtain the outside option instead. Without the refusal option, truth-telling is not strategically dominated by any strategies if a fair rank-minimizing mechanism is used. However, if agents have the option and the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is used, then a strategy called an outside option demotion strategy strategically dominates truth-telling. Moreover, we show that adopting this strategy may lead to inefficient assignments. To counter this, we propose a modification of the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism, though it may lead agents to strategically reduce the number of acceptable types.</description>

      <title>Persuasion with Ambiguous Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores whether and to what extent ambiguous communication can be beneficial to the sender in a persuasion problem, when the receiver (and possibly the sender) is ambiguity averse. We provide a concavification-like characterization of the sender's optimal ambiguous communication. The characterization highlights the necessity of using a collection of experiments that form a splitting of an obedient (i.e., incentive compatible) experiment. Some experiments in the collection must be Pareto-ranked in the sense that both players agree on their payoff ranking. The existence of a binary such Pareto-ranked splitting is necessary for ambiguous communication to benefit the sender, and, if an optimal Bayesian persuasion experiment can be split in this way, this is sufficient for an ambiguity-neutral sender as well as the receiver to benefit. Such gains are impossible when the receiver has only two actions. The possibility of gains is substantially robust to (non-extreme) sender ambiguity aversion.</description>

      <title>Risk aversion can promote cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative dynamics are central to our understanding of many phenomena in living and complex systems. However, we lack a universal mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. We present a novel framework for modelling social dilemma games with an arbitrary number of players by combining reaction networks, methods from quantum mechanics applied to stochastic complex systems, game theory and stochastic simulations of molecular reactions. Using this framework, we propose a novel and robust mechanism for cooperation based on risk aversion that leads to cooperative behaviour in population games. Rather than individuals seeking to maximise payouts in the long run, individuals seek to obtain a minimum set of resources with a given level of confidence and in a limited time span. We show that this mechanism can lead to the emergence of new equilibria in a range of social dilemma games.</description>
