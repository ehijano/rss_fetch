      <title>An Imaging Radar Using a Rydberg Atom Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in a gas form are highly sensitive electric field probes capable of detecting and measuring the amplitude, phase, and polarization of broadband time-varying signals. Here, we present the performance of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar using a Rydberg atom-based subwavelength sensor as a receiver. This sensor down converts the radar echoes, eliminates key FMCW electrical components, and performs two-dimensional target localization. To demonstrate its capabilities, we present an RF image of a scene containing targets in an anechoic room with radar cross sections down to 0 dBsm at a distance up to 5 m and with a range resolution of 4.7 cm.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered nondispersive wave packets in helium under combined periodic and static fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of two-electron nondispersive wave packets in fully three-dimensional helium subjected to a linearly polarized monochromatic field. These localized quantum states follow periodic trajectories of the classical three-body Coulomb system without dispersion. The system is modeled using a spectral configuration interaction approach based on Coulomb-Sturmian functions, combined with Floquet theory and complex scaling. The resulting quasienergy spectrum reveals the existence of long-lived Floquet states arising from near-resonant coupling between frozen planet configurations.</description>

      <title>Rotational cooling of large trapped molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state. This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Probing valence electron and hydrogen dynamics using charge-pair imaging with ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in ultrafast science has been to directly track the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei in real-space and real-time. This study presents a significant step towards this goal by demonstrating the feasibility of time-resolved real-space tracking of valence electron and hydrogen dynamics during the photodissociation of ammonia (NH3) using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the enhanced temporal resolution, in conjunction with the analysis of the charge-pair distribution function, enables the disentanglement of the correlated motion of valence electrons and hydrogens in photoexcited ammonia molecule. The methodology employed in this study, which utilizes the charge-pair distribution function from ultrafast electron scattering to retrieve intertwined electron and nucleus dynamics, may open up new opportunities in the study of quantum dynamics for a wide range of molecules.</description>

      <title>Cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle via measurement-free coherent feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>
