      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Ion-Acoustic Waves with Landau Damping in Non-Maxwellian Space Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in the presence of kinetic (Landau type) damping have been investigated in a collisionless, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. A cold ion fluid model, coupled to a Vlasov-type kinetic equation for the electron dynamics, has been adopted as a starting point. The electron population was assumed to be in a kappa-distributed state, in account of the non-Maxwellian behavior of energetic (suprathermal) electrons often observed in Space. A multiscale perturbation technique has led to an evolution equation for the electrostatic potential, in the form of a modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, incorporating a non-local term accounting for Landau damping (associated with the electron statistics). Exact analytical solutions have been obtained, representing solitary waves undergoing amplitude decay over time. The combined effect of Landau damping and non-Maxwellian electron statistics (via the kappa parameter) on the characteristics of IASWs has been examined. Numerical integration of the evolution equation has been undertaken, to elucidate the importance of kinetic Landau damping on a shock-shaped initial condition. The results of this investigation aim to improve our understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear electrostatic waves under the influence of Landau damping in various space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>
