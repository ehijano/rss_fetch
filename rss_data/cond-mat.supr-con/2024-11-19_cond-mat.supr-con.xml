      <description>arXiv:2411.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of hydride superconductivity has recently been mired in a controversy that might divert attention from the question of central importance: do hydrides support genuine superconductivity or not? We examine some key papers from the field, and conclude that hydride superconductivity is real.</description>

      <title>Layer thickness and substrate effects on superconductivity in epitaxial FeSe films on BLG/SiC(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered nature and simple structure of FeSe reveal this iron-based superconductor as a unique building block for the design of artificial heterostructure materials. While superconductivity develops in ultrathin films of FeSe on SrTiO3 substrates, it remains unclear whether it can be developed on more chemically inert, layered materials such as graphene. Here, we report on the characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of few-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three layers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is supported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our STS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on BLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying electronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust against magnetic fields. Superconductivity in FeSe/BLG/SiC(0001), however, emerges for thicker films with a transition temperature of 6 K. Our results underscore the significance of the substrate as key factor driving the suppression superconductivity in FeSe in the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation for point-node-like s-wave superconductivity in f-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation using an f-d-p model, which is an effective model of UTe2. Solving the linearized Eliashberg equation in the f-d-p model based on third-order perturbation theory, we obtain a point-node-like s-wave pairing state. Our result shows that the Hebel-Slichter peak in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state is smaller than that in the isotropic s-wave pairing state. However, the Hebel-Slichter peak remains robust even in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state, and the point-node-like s-wave state is inconsistent with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.</description>

      <title>Strongly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics in La3Ni2O7 with Coherent-to-Incoherent Crossover of Interlayer Charge Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an optical spectroscopy study of the charge-dynamics anisotropy in the La3Ni2O7 single crystals with the electric field of the incident light parallel to the crystalline c-axis and ab-plane respectively. The evolution of the low-energy part of its c-axis optical conductivity spectra ({\sigma}1c({\omega})) from a Drude component to a finite-energy peak, together with the change in the c-axis electron mean-free-path which is distinctly longer than the c-axis lattice constant at 10 K but is shorter than the c-axis lattice constant at 300 K, demonstrates a crossover from coherent to incoherent interlayer charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7, which is associated with the variation from weak to strong dissipation within its ab-plane. In contrast, the Drude component robust in its {\sigma}1ab({\omega}) and the long ab-plane electron mean-free-path greater than the a-axis and b-axis unit-cell lengths manifest the persistence of coherent in-plane charge dynamics from 10 to 300 K. Thus, the charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7 shows a remarkable anisotropy at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the large values of the ratio between the ab-plane and c-axis Drude weights and the ratio {\sigma}1ab({\omega} -&gt; 0)/{\sigma}1c({\omega} -&gt; 0) indicate a strong anisotropy of the low-temperature charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Amplitude mode in a multi-gap superconductor MgB$_2$ investigated by terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated terahertz (THz) nonlinear responses in a multi-gap superconductor, MgB$_2$, using THz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz 2DCS). With broad-band THz drives, we identified a well-defined nonlinear response near the lower superconducting gap energy $2\Delta_{\pi}$ only at the lowest temperatures. Using narrow-band THz driving pulses, we observed first (FH) and third harmonic responses, and the FH intensity shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature when properly normalized by the driving field strength. This is distinct from the single-gap superconductor NbN, where the FH signal exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ when the superconducting gap energy was resonant with the driving photon energy and which had been interpreted to originate from the superconducting amplitude mode. Our results in MgB$_2$ are consistent with a well-defined amplitude mode only at the lowest temperatures and indicate strong damping as temperature increases. This likely indicates the importance of interband coupling in MgB$_2$ and its influence on the nature of the amplitude mode and its damping.</description>

      <title>Imaging half-unit-cell Cooper-pair density waves in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors that spontaneously break space-group symmetries of their underlying crystal lattice are distinguished by spatial modulations of the superconducting order parameter. These states have recently captured significant attention in various strongly correlated materials, where the breaking of translational or intra-unit-cell symmetries results in the emergence of pair density waves with wavelengths extending across one or multiple unit cells. Here, we employ a spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscope to identify robust half-unit-cell modulations of the superconducting gap magnitude, coherence strength and subgap states in tunable 1T$^{\prime}$-MoTe$_2$ monolayer. The modulations are oriented perpendicular to the zigzag Mo chains and coexist with three-unit-cell primary pair density wave modulations along the Mo chains, both of which attenuate with increasing temperature and the application of external magnetic fields. Importantly, we find that the superconductivity modulations are strongly linked to unconventional electron pairing mechanisms, which significantly deviate from the Cooper pairing observed in traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. Our results advance the knowledge of Cooper-pair density modulations and the intricate interplay with other symmetry-breaking states in strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Josephson Supercurrent Diode Effect Induced by Chiral Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral materials lacking mirror symmetry can exhibit unconventional spin-orbit fields, including fully momentum-aligned radial Rashba fields as seen in twisted van-der-Waals homobilayers. We theoretically study Cooper-pair transfer in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with crossed (tangential and radial) interfacial Rashba fields. We find that their interplay leads to what we call the unconventional supercurrent diode effect (SDE), where supercurrent rectification occurs even with collinear (w.r.t. the current) barrier magnetization, not possible for conventional spin-orbit fields. This SDE, distinct from conventional Rashba-induced effects on Cooper-pair momenta, arises from the spin precession in the magnetic barrier. We propose it as a sensitive probe of chiral spin textures.</description>

      <title>Novel Superconducting Ternary Hydrides under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundant chemical compositions in ternary hydrides bring much more possibility to explore high temperature superconductors under lower pressure. Here we constructed 115 ternary hydrides on the basis of the elements substitution using 16 metal elements within 5 reported prototype structures. We conducted a three-step approach to screen and study these candidate structures in the aspects of dynamical stability, formation energy and relative enthalpy, respectively. Based on this approach, we found three meta-stable compounds with hydrogen clathrate cages in the space group of P-3m1, including Y2CdH18, Y2InH18 and Ca2SnH18. All of the structures are superconductive under high pressure with Tc above 110 K, which is larger than the superconductive temperature of liquid nitrogen. Our study enriches the database of novel ternary hydrides under high pressure, and provides insight for future theoretical and experimental researches.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale control over single vortex motion in an unconventional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize braiding of vortex lines and understand the basic properties of the energy landscape for vortex motion, precise manipulation of superconducting vortices on the nanoscale is required. Here, we reveal that a localized trapping potential powerful enough to pull in the vortex line can be created with nanoscale precision on the surface of an FeSe superconductor using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The mechanism of tip-induced force is traced to local modification of electronic properties and reduction of the superconducting gap, most likely due to tip-induced strain. Intriguingly, the tip-induced trapping potential is much less pronounced along the twin boundaries, dramatically reducing the vortice's degree of motion relative to the surrounding lattice. By enabling nanoscale manipulation of single vortices in Fe-based superconductors, and likely similar materials with strong strain-susceptibility of the superconducting gap, our findings provide an important step toward further development of vortex-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Yamaji effect in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudogap state of high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates, known for its partial gapping of the Fermi surface above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is believed to hold the key to understanding the origin of Planckian relaxation and quantum criticality. However, the nature of the Fermi surface in the pseudogap state has remained a fundamental open question. Here, we report the observation of the Yamaji effect above $T_{\rm c}$ in the single layer cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This observation is direct evidence of closed Fermi surface pockets in the normal state of the pseudogap phase. The small size of the pockets determined from the Yamaji effect (occupying approximately $1.3\%$ of the Brillouin zone area) is all the more surprising given the absence of evidence for long-range broken translational symmetry that can reconstruct the Fermi-surface.</description>

      <title>Towards ultrastrong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit that has been shown to reach strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes. Here we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with the cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude from the earlier ones. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current by applying small magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, we provide a new tool for quantum thermodynamics aimed at realizing true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and environment.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Competing phases in kagome magnet FeGe from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave in FeGe extends the discussion of the nature of charge order in kagome metals to a magnetic compound. Motivated by this observation, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and functional-renormalization-group calculations to study interaction-induced Fermi-surface instabilities of the magnetic state of FeGe. We argue that the leading intra-band contribution to electronic correlations are approximately 2D and come from Van Hove points at the projected $M$~points. By varying parameters around DFT values, we determine a phase diagram for the quasi-2D scenario as function of on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We discuss universal aspects in the electronic mechanisms for the resulting phases, as well as the role of SU(2) symmetry breaking. We find FeGe to be in a regime of strong competition between $p$-wave charge density wave, $f$-wave pairing, and $d$-wave spin Pomeranchuk instabilities. This interplay can be influenced in favor of superconducting pairing for slightly increased nearest-neighbor interaction, suggesting a potential to induce superconductivity in FeGe.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of vortices in type-II superconductors is crucial for comprehending exotic superconductors and advancing the application of superconducting materials in future electronic devices. This study uses spectroscopic scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize Josephson vortices along crystalline domain boundaries in the superconducting spinel oxide LiTi2O4 (LTO). Our experimental results reveal that the local curvature of the Josephson junction dictates the positioning of Josephson vortices. Self-consistent solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes and gap equations theoretically corroborate this observation. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the physics of Josephson vortex formation, this study offers potential guidelines for developing vortex-based superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Frustrated superconductivity and intrinsic reduction of $T_c$ in trilayer nickelate</title>

Abstract: Identifying the key factors controlling the magnitude of $T_c$ is of critical importance in the pursuit of high-temperature superconductivity. In cuprates, $T_c$ reaches its maximal value in trilayer structure, leading to the belief that interlayer coupling may help promote the pairing. In contrast, for the recently discovered nickelate superconductors under high pressure, the maximum $T_c$ is reduced from about 80 K in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ to 30 K in the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Motivated by this opposite trend, we propose an interlayer pairing scenario for the superconductivity of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Our theory reveals intrinsic frustration in the spin-singlet pairing that the inner layer tends to form with both of the two outer layers respectively, leading to strong superconducting fluctuations between layers. This explains the reduction of its maximum $T_c$ compared to that of the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. Our findings support a fundamental distinction between multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors, and ascribe it to their different (interlayer versus intralayer) pairing mechanisms. Furthermore, our theory predicts extended $s^\pm$-wave gap structures in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, with varying signs and possible nodes on different Fermi pockets. We also find an intrinsic Josephson coupling with potentially interesting consequences that may be examined in future experiments. Our work reveals the possibility of rich novel physics in multilayer superconductors with interlayer pairing.</description>

      <title>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence and intra-valley pairing in moire heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>
