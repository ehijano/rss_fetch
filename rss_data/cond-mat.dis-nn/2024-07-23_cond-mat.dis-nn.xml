      <title>Physics of the Edwards-Anderson Spin Glass in Dimensions $d=3,\ldots,8$ from Heuristic Ground State Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a collection of simulations of the Edwards-Anderson lattice spin glass at $T=0$ to elucidate the nature of low-energy excitations over a range of dimensions that reach from physically realizable systems to the mean-field limit. Using heuristic methods, we sample ground states of instances to determine their energies while eliciting excitations through manipulating boundary conditions. We exploit the universality of the phase diagram of bond-diluted lattices to make such a study in higher dimensions computationally feasible. As a result, we obtain a verity of accurate exponents for domain wall stiffness and finite-size corrections that allow us to examine their dimensional behavior and their connection with predictions from mean-field theory. We also provide an experimentally testable prediction for the thermal-to-percolative crossover exponent in dilute lattices Ising spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Vacuum induced three-body delocalization in cavity quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that the vacuum itself suffices to delocalize an Anderson insulator inside a cavity. By studying a disordered one-dimensional spinless fermion system coupled to a single photon mode describing the vacuum fluctuation, we find that even though the cavity mode does not qualitatively change the localization behavior for a single-fermion system, it indeed leads to delocalization via a vacuum fluctuation-induced correlated hopping mechanism for systems with at least three fermions. A mobility edge separating the low-energy localized eigenstates and the high-energy delocalized eigenstates has been revealed. It is shown that such a one-dimensional three-fermion system in with correlated hopping can be mapped to a single-particle system with hopping along the face diagonals in a three dimensional lattice. The effect of the dissipation as well as a many-body generalization have also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions fulfill "holographic" area laws, and the correlation fractal dimension is precisely $d_2=2$.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Feature Detection and Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological vision systems seamlessly integrate feature-sensitive spatial processing and strong nonlinearity. The retina performs feature detection via ganglion cells, which nonlinearly enhance image features such as edges through lateral inhibition processes between neighbouring cells. As demand for specialised machine learning hardware increases, physical systems are sought which combine feature detection with the nonlinear processing required for tasks such as image classification. Currently, physical machine vision schemes detect features linearly, then employ separate digital systems for subsequent nonlinear activation. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using a semiconductor network laser. The system hosts many spatially-overlapping lasing modes which detect multiple image features in parallel via their lasing amplitude. Integrated nonlinearity is provided by antagonistic competition for gain between modes - a photonic analogue of the lateral inhibition in retinal cells. Detected feature maps are fed back through the system, providing multi-layer image classification with intrinsic nonlinear processing. Accuracies of 98.05% and 87.85% are achieved for MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST tasks respectively.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for viscoelasticity of soft jammed solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viscoelastic properties of soft jammed solids, such as foams, emulsions, and soft colloids, have been the subject of experiments, with particular interest in the anomalous viscous loss. However, a microscopic theory to explain these experimental results is still lacking. Here, we develop an effective medium theory that incorporates the effects of contact damping. The theory explains experimentally observed viscoelastic properties, particularly attributing the anomalous viscous loss to marginal stability in amorphous systems. This work establishes a microscopic theory for describing the impact of damping on soft jammed solids and their viscoelastic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of GUE and their ratio: an analytic treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former unnecessitates the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to\infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings address that high socioeconomic homophily can create a dilemma between growth and equality, and that hub monopolization by few highly talented agents makes economic growth strongly dependent on their performances.</description>

      <title>Predictive Coding Networks and Inference Learning: Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</description>
