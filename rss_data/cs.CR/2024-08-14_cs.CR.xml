      <title>Evaluating Privacy Measures for Load Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In smart grids, the use of smart meters to measure electricity consumption at a household level raises privacy concerns. To address them, researchers have designed various load hiding algorithms that manipulate the electricity consumption measured. To compare how well these algorithms preserve privacy, various privacy measures have been proposed. However, there currently is no consensus on which privacy measure is most appropriate to use. In this study, we aim to identify the most effective privacy measure(s) for load hiding algorithms. We have crafted a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of these measures. found 20 of the 25 measures studied to be ineffective. Next, focused on the well-known "appliance usage" secret, we have designed synthetic data to find the measure that best deals with this secret. We observe that such a measure, a variant of mutual information, actually exists.</description>

      <title>Statistical Quality Comparison of the Bitstrings Generated by a Physical Unclonable Function across Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy or randomness represents a foundational security property in security-related operations, such as key generation. Key generation in turn is central to security protocols such as authentication and encryption. Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are hardware-based primitives that can serve as key generation engines in modern microelectronic devices and applications. PUFs derive entropy from manufacturing variations that exist naturally within and across otherwise identical copies of a device. However, the levels of random variations that represent entropy, which are strongly correlated to the quality of the PUF-generated bitstrings, vary from one manufacturer to another. In this paper, we evaluate entropy across a set of devices manufactured by three mainstream FPGA vendors, Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi. The devices selected for evaluation are considered low-end commercial devices to make the analysis relevant to IoT applications. The SiRF PUF is used in the evaluation, and is constructed nearly identically across the three vendor devices, setting aside minor differences that exist in certain logic element primitives used within the PUF architecture, and which have only a minor impact on our comparative analysis. The SiRF PUF uses a high-resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) crafted from high-speed carry-chain logic embedded within each device to measure path delays in an engineered netlist of logic gates as a source of entropy. Therefore, our analysis includes an evaluation of actual path delay variation as it exists across the three device classes, as well as a statistical evaluation of the PUF-generated bitstrings. A reliablity analysis is also provided using data collected in industrial-standard temperature experiments to round out the evaluation of important statistical properties of the PUF.</description>

      <title>Theorem-Carrying-Transaction: Runtime Certification to Ensure Safety for Smart Contract Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security bugs and trapdoors in smart contracts have been impacting the Ethereum community since its inception. Conceptually, the 1.45-million Ethereum's contracts form a single "gigantic program" whose behaviors are determined by the complex reference-topology between the contracts. Can the Ethereum community be assured that this gigantic program conforms to its design-level safety properties, despite unforeseeable code-level intricacies? Static code verification is inadequate due to the program's gigantic scale and high polymorphism. In this paper, we present a viable technological roadmap for the community toward this ambitious goal. Our technology, called Theorem-Carrying-Transaction (TCT), combines the benefits of concrete execution and symbolic proofs. Under the TCT protocol, every transaction carries a theorem that proves its adherence to the specified properties in the invoked contracts, and the runtime system checks the theorem before executing the transaction. Once a property is specified in a contract, it can be treated confidently as an unconditional guarantee made by the contract. As case studies, we demonstrate that TCT secures token contracts without foreseeing code-level intricacies like integer overflow and reentrancy. TCT is also successfully applied to a Uniswap codebase, showcasing a complex decentralized finance (DeFi) scenario. Our prototype incurs a negligible runtime overhead, two orders of magnitude lower than a state-of-the-art approach.</description>

      <title>CRISP: Confidentiality, Rollback, and Integrity Storage Protection for Confidential Cloud-Native Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) protect the integrity and confidentiality of running code and its associated data. Nevertheless, TEEs' integrity protection does not extend to the state saved on disk. Furthermore, modern cloud-native applications heavily rely on orchestration (e.g., through systems such as Kubernetes) and, thus, have their services frequently restarted. During restarts, attackers can revert the state of confidential services to a previous version that may aid their malicious intent. This paper presents CRISP, a rollback protection mechanism that uses an existing runtime for Intel SGX and transparently prevents rollback. Our approach can constrain the attack window to a fixed and short period or give developers the tools to avoid the vulnerability window altogether. Finally, experiments show that applying CRISP in a critical stateful cloud-native application may incur a resource increase but only a minor performance penalty.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attack Against Masked Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved significant success in the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL) for visual recognition. The image encoder pre-trained through MIM, involving the masking and subsequent reconstruction of input images, attains state-of-the-art performance in various downstream vision tasks. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of MIM.In this work, we take a different angle by studying the pre-training data privacy of MIM. Specifically, we propose the first membership inference attack against image encoders pre-trained by MIM, which aims to determine whether an image is part of the MIM pre-training dataset. The key design is to simulate the pre-training paradigm of MIM, i.e., image masking and subsequent reconstruction, and then obtain reconstruction errors. These reconstruction errors can serve as membership signals for achieving attack goals, as the encoder is more capable of reconstructing the input image in its training set with lower errors. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three model architectures and three benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that our attack outperforms baseline methods. Additionally, we undertake intricate ablation studies to analyze multiple factors that could influence the performance of the attack.</description>

      <title>Stateful protocol fuzzing with statemap-based reverse state selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stateful Coverage-Based Greybox Fuzzing (SCGF) is considered the state-of-the-art method for network protocol greybox fuzzing. During the protocol fuzzing process, SCGF constructs the state machine of the target protocol by identifying protocol states. Optimal states are selected for fuzzing using heuristic methods, along with corresponding seeds and mutation regions, to effectively conduct fuzz testing. Nevertheless, existing SCGF methodologies prioritise the selection of protocol states without considering the correspondence between program basic block coverage information and protocol states. To address this gap, this paper proposes a statemap-based reverse state selection method for SCGF. This approach prioritises the coverage information of fuzzy test seeds, and delves deeper into the correspondence between the basic block coverage information of the programme and the protocol state, with the objective of improving the bitmap coverage. The state map is employed to simplify the state machine representation method. Furthermore, the design of different types of states has enabled the optimisation of the method of constructing message sequences, the reduction in the length of message sequences further improve the efficiency of test case execution. By optimising the SCGF, we developed SMGFuzz and conducted experiments utilising Profuzzbench in order to assess the testing efficiency of SMGFuzz.The results indicate that compared to AFLNet, SMGFuzz achieved an average increase of 12.48% in edges coverage, a 50.1% increase in unique crashes and a 40.2% increase in test case execution speed over a period of 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Improving WiFi CSI Fingerprinting with IQ Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity authentication is crucial for ensuring the information security of wireless communication. Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques provide a prom-ising supplement to cryptography-based authentication approaches but rely on dedicated equipment to capture in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples, hindering their wide adoption. Recent advances advocate easily obtainable channel state in-formation (CSI) by commercial WiFi devices for lightweight RF fingerprinting, but they mainly focus on eliminating channel interference and cannot address the challenges of coarse granularity and information loss of CSI measurements. To overcome these challenges, we propose CSI2Q, a novel CSI fingerprinting sys-tem that achieves comparable performance to IQ-based approaches. Instead of ex-tracting fingerprints directly from raw CSI measurements, CSI2Q first transforms them into time-domain signals that share the same feature space with IQ samples. Then, the distinct advantages of an IQ fingerprinting model in feature extraction are transferred to its CSI counterpart via an auxiliary training strategy. Finally, the trained CSI fingerprinting model is used to decide which device the sample under test comes from. We evaluate CSI2Q on both synthetic and real CSI datasets. On the synthetic dataset, our system can improve the recognition accuracy from 76% to 91%. On the real dataset, CSI2Q boosts the accuracy from 67% to 82%.</description>

      <title>Better Gaussian Mechanism using Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple variant of the Gaussian mechanism for answering differentially private queries when the sensitivity space has a certain common structure. Our motivating problem is the fundamental task of answering $d$ counting queries under the add/remove neighboring relation. The standard Gaussian mechanism solves this task by adding noise distributed as a Gaussian with variance scaled by $d$ independently to each count. We show that adding a random variable distributed as a Gaussian with variance scaled by $(\sqrt{d} + 1)/4$ to all counts allows us to reduce the variance of the independent Gaussian noise samples to scale only with $(d + \sqrt{d})/4$. The total noise added to each counting query follows a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation scaled by $(\sqrt{d} + 1)/2$ rather than $\sqrt{d}$. The central idea of our mechanism is simple and the technique is flexible. We show that applying our technique to another problem gives similar improvements over the standard Gaussian mechanism.</description>

      <title>Voltran: Unlocking Trust and Confidentiality in Decentralized Federated Learning Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decentralized Federated Learning (FL) paradigm built upon blockchain architectures leverages distributed node clusters to replace the single server for executing FL model aggregation. This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains to perform large-scale FL computations. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution, and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of attack-fault trees via Markov decision processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adequate risk assessment of safety critical systems needs to take both safety and security into account, as well as their interaction. A prominent methodology for modeling safety and security are attack-fault trees (AFTs), which combine the well-established fault tree and attack tree methodologies for safety and security, respectively. AFTs can be used for quantitative analysis as well, capturing the interplay between safety and security metrics. However, existing approaches are based on modeling the AFT as a priced-timed automaton. This allows for a wide range of analyses, but Pareto analsis is still lacking, and analyses that exist are computationally expensive. In this paper, we combine safety and security analysis techniques to introduce a novel method to find the Pareto front between the metrics reliability (safety) and attack cost (security) using Markov decision processes. This gives us the full interplay between safety and security while being considerably more lightweight and faster than the automaton approach. We validate our approach on a case study of cyberattacks on an oil pipe line.</description>

      <title>PayOff: A Regulated Central Bank Digital Currency with Private Offline Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Central Bank is preparing for the potential issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), called the digital euro. A recent regulatory proposal by the European Commission defines several requirements for the digital euro, such as support for both online and offline payments. Offline payments are expected to enable cash-like privacy, local payment settlement, and the enforcement of holding limits. While other central banks have expressed similar desired functionality, achieving such offline payments poses a novel technical challenge. We observe that none of the existing research solutions, including offline E-cash schemes, are fully compliant. Proposed solutions based on secure elements offer no guarantees in case of compromise and can therefore lead to significant payment fraud.
  The main contribution of this paper is PayOff, a novel CBDC design motivated by the digital euro regulation, which focuses on offline payments. We analyze the security implications of local payment settlement and identify new security objectives. PayOff protects user privacy, supports complex regulations such as holding limits, and implements safeguards to increase robustness against secure element failure. Our analysis shows that PayOff provides strong privacy and identifies residual leakages that may arise in real-world deployments. Our evaluation shows that offline payments can be fast and that the central bank can handle high payment loads with moderate computing resources. However, the main limitation of PayOff is that offline payment messages and storage requirements grow in the number of payments that the sender makes or receives without going online in between.</description>

      <title>Casper: Prompt Sanitization for Protecting User Privacy in Web-Based Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web-based Large Language Model (LLM) services have been widely adopted and have become an integral part of our Internet experience. Third-party plugins enhance the functionalities of LLM by enabling access to real-world data and services. However, the privacy consequences associated with these services and their third-party plugins are not well understood. Sensitive prompt data are stored, processed, and shared by cloud-based LLM providers and third-party plugins. In this paper, we propose Casper, a prompt sanitization technique that aims to protect user privacy by detecting and removing sensitive information from user inputs before sending them to LLM services. Casper runs entirely on the user's device as a browser extension and does not require any changes to the online LLM services. At the core of Casper is a three-layered sanitization mechanism consisting of a rule-based filter, a Machine Learning (ML)-based named entity recognizer, and a browser-based local LLM topic identifier. We evaluate Casper on a dataset of 4000 synthesized prompts and show that it can effectively filter out Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and privacy-sensitive topics with high accuracy, at 98.5% and 89.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Improved Counting under Continual Observation with Pure Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting under continual observation is a well-studied problem in the area of differential privacy. Given a stream of updates $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_T \in \{0,1\}$ the problem is to continuously release estimates of the prefix sums $\sum_{i=1}^t x_i$ for $t=1,\dots,T$ while protecting each input $x_i$ in the stream with differential privacy. Recently, significant leaps have been made in our understanding of this problem under $\textit{approximate}$ differential privacy, aka. $(\varepsilon,\delta)$$\textit{-differential privacy}$. However, for the classical case of $\varepsilon$-differential privacy, we are not aware of any improvement in mean squared error since the work of Honaker (TPDP 2015). In this paper we present such an improvement, reducing the mean squared error by a factor of about 4, asymptotically. The key technique is a new generalization of the binary tree mechanism that uses a $k$-ary number system with $\textit{negative digits}$ to improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off. Our mechanism improves the mean squared error over all 'optimal' $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private factorization mechanisms based on Gaussian noise whenever $\delta$ is sufficiently small. Specifically, using $k=19$ we get an asymptotic improvement over the bound given in the work by Henzinger, Upadhyay and Upadhyay (SODA 2023) when $\delta = O(T^{-0.92})$.</description>

      <title>TableGuard -- Securing Structured &amp; Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for data sharing across platforms and organizations, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper introduces "TableGuard". An innovative approach to data obfuscation tailored for relational databases. Building on the principles and techniques developed in prior work on context-sensitive obfuscation, TableGuard applies these methods to ensure that API calls return only obfuscated data, thereby safeguarding privacy when sharing data with third parties. TableGuard leverages advanced context-sensitive obfuscation techniques to replace sensitive data elements with contextually appropriate alternatives. By maintaining the relational integrity and coherence of the data, our approach mitigates the risks of cognitive dissonance and data leakage. We demonstrate the implementation of TableGuard using a BERT based transformer model, which identifies and obfuscates sensitive entities within relational tables. Our evaluation shows that TableGuard effectively balances privacy protection with data utility, minimizing information loss while ensuring that the obfuscated data remains functionally useful for downstream applications. The results highlight the importance of domain-specific obfuscation strategies and the role of context length in preserving data integrity. The implications of this research are significant for organizations that need to share data securely with external parties. TableGuard offers a robust framework for implementing privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of data privacy and security.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Leakage in Password Managers via Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores injection attacks against password managers. In this setting, the adversary (only) controls their own application client, which they use to "inject" chosen payloads to a victim's client via, for example, sharing credentials with them. The injections are interleaved with adversarial observations of some form of protected state (such as encrypted vault exports or the network traffic received by the application servers), from which the adversary backs out confidential information. We uncover a series of general design patterns in popular password managers that lead to vulnerabilities allowing an adversary to efficiently recover passwords, URLs, usernames, and attachments. We develop general attack templates to exploit these design patterns and experimentally showcase their practical efficacy via analysis of ten distinct password manager applications. We disclosed our findings to these vendors, many of which deployed mitigations.</description>

      <title>Fast John Ellipsoid Computation with Differential Privacy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Determining the John ellipsoid - the largest volume ellipsoid contained within a convex polytope - is a fundamental problem with applications in machine learning, optimization, and data analytics. Recent work has developed fast algorithms for approximating the John ellipsoid using sketching and leverage score sampling techniques. However, these algorithms do not provide privacy guarantees for sensitive input data. In this paper, we present the first differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation. Our method integrates noise perturbation with sketching and leverage score sampling to achieve both efficiency and privacy. We prove that (1) our algorithm provides $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, and the privacy guarantee holds for neighboring datasets that are $\epsilon_0$-close, allowing flexibility in the privacy definition; (2) our algorithm still converges to a $(1+\xi)$-approximation of the optimal John ellipsoid in $O(\xi^{-2}(\log(n/\delta_0) + (L\epsilon_0)^{-2}))$ iterations where $n$ is the number of data point, $L$ is the Lipschitz constant, $\delta_0$ is the failure probability, and $\epsilon_0$ is the closeness of neighboring input datasets. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's convergence and privacy properties, providing a robust approach for balancing utility and privacy in John ellipsoid computation. This is the first differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation, opening avenues for future research in privacy-preserving optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Secure Code Assessment: A Multi-Language Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most vulnerability detection studies focus on datasets of vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, offering limited language diversity. Thus, the effectiveness of deep learning methods, including large language models (LLMs), in detecting software vulnerabilities beyond these languages is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and classifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) using different prompt and role strategies. Our experimental study targets six state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs (GPT-3.5- Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, CodeLLama-7B, CodeLLama- 13B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and five programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. We compiled a multi-language vulnerability dataset from different sources, to ensure representativeness. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieves the highest vulnerability detection and CWE classification scores using a few-shot setting. Aside from the quantitative results of our study, we developed a library called CODEGUARDIAN integrated with VSCode which enables developers to perform LLM-assisted real-time vulnerability analysis in real-world security scenarios. We have evaluated CODEGUARDIAN with a user study involving 22 developers from the industry. Our study showed that, by using CODEGUARDIAN, developers are more accurate and faster at detecting vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Fooling SHAP with Output Shuffling Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI~(XAI) methods such as SHAP can help discover feature attributions in black-box models. If the method reveals a significant attribution from a ``protected feature'' (e.g., gender, race) on the model output, the model is considered unfair. However, adversarial attacks can subvert the detection of XAI methods. Previous approaches to constructing such an adversarial model require access to underlying data distribution, which may not be possible in many practical scenarios. We relax this constraint and propose a novel family of attacks, called shuffling attacks, that are data-agnostic. The proposed attack strategies can adapt any trained machine learning model to fool Shapley value-based explanations. We prove that Shapley values cannot detect shuffling attacks. However, algorithms that estimate Shapley values, such as linear SHAP and SHAP, can detect these attacks with varying degrees of effectiveness. We demonstrate the efficacy of the attack strategies by comparing the performance of linear SHAP and SHAP using real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally-bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers, as well as complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layered Security System: Integrating Quantum Key Distribution with Classical Cryptography to Enhance Steganographic Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel cryptographic system that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with classical encryption techniques to secure steganographic images. Our approach leverages the E91 QKD protocol to generate a shared secret key between communicating parties, ensuring the highest level of security against eavesdropping through the principles of quantum mechanics. This key is then hashed using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to provide a fixedlength, high-entropy key, which is subsequently utilized in symmetric encryption. We explore the use of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithms for encrypting steganographic images, which hide sensitive information within digital images to provide an additional layer of security through obscurity. The combination of QKD, hashing, and symmetric encryption offers a robust security framework that mitigates various attack vectors, enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, highlighting its performance in terms of key generation rates, encryption/decryption speeds, and the computational overhead introduced by the hashing and steganographic processes. By integrating quantum and classical cryptographic methods with steganography, this work provides a comprehensive security solution that is highly resistant to both quantum and classical attacks, making it suitable for applications requiring stringent security measures. This paper contributes to the ongoing research in cryptographic systems, offering insights into the practical implementation and potential benefits of hybrid quantumclassical security protocols.</description>

      <title>Faster Private Minimum Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in clustering and synthetic data generation, we consider the problem of releasing a minimum spanning tree (MST) under edge-weight differential privacy constraints where a graph topology $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is public, the weight matrix $\vec{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is private, and we wish to release an approximate MST under $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy. Weight matrices are considered neighboring if they differ by at most $\Delta_\infty$ in each entry, i.e., we consider an $\ell_\infty$ neighboring relationship. Existing private MST algorithms either add noise to each entry in $\vec{W}$ and estimate the MST by post-processing or add noise to weights in-place during the execution of a specific MST algorithm. Using the post-processing approach with an efficient MST algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time on dense graphs but results in an additive error on the weight of the MST of magnitude $O(n^2\log n)$. In-place algorithms give asymptotically better utility, but the running time of existing in-place algorithms is $O(n^3)$ for dense graphs. Our main result is a new differentially private MST algorithm that matches the utility of existing in-place methods while running in time $O(m + n^{3/2}\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter $\rho$. The technical core of our algorithm is an efficient sublinear time simulation of Report-Noisy-Max that works by discretizing all edge weights to a multiple of $\Delta_\infty$ and forming groups of edges with identical weights. Specifically, we present a data structure that allows us to sample a noisy minimum weight edge among at most $O(n^2)$ cut edges in $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ time. Experimental evaluations support our claims that our algorithm significantly improves previous algorithms either in utility or running time.</description>

      <title>The Complexities of Differential Privacy for Survey Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of differential privacy (DP) has gained substantial attention in recent years, most notably since the U.S. Census Bureau announced the adoption of the concept for its 2020 Decennial Census. However, despite its attractive theoretical properties, implementing DP in practice remains challenging, especially when it comes to survey data. In this paper we present some results from an ongoing project funded by the U.S. Census Bureau that is exploring the possibilities and limitations of DP for survey data. Specifically, we identify five aspects that need to be considered when adopting DP in the survey context: the multi-staged nature of data production; the limited privacy amplification from complex sampling designs; the implications of survey-weighted estimates; the weighting adjustments for nonresponse and other data deficiencies, and the imputation of missing values. We summarize the project's key findings with respect to each of these aspects and also discuss some of the challenges that still need to be addressed before DP could become the new data protection standard at statistical agencies.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Decentralized IPFS Cluster: Unlocking Trustworthy Data Permanency for Off-Chain Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Decentralized Applications, off-chain storage solutions such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) are crucial in overcoming Blockchain storage limitations. However, the assurance of data permanency in IPFS relies on the pinning of data, which comes with trust issues and potential single points of failure. This paper introduces Verifiable Decentralized IPFS Clusters (VDICs) to enhance off-chain storage reliability with verifiable data permanency guarantees. VDICs leverage Decentralized Identifier, Verifiable Credentials, and IPFS Clusters to create a trustworthy ecosystem where the storage of pinned data is transparent and verifiable. Performance evaluations demonstrate that VDICs are competitive with traditional pinning services. Real-life use cases validate their feasibility and practicality for providers of Decentralized Applications focused on ensuring data permanency.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Grover's Algorithm in the classical rainbow table, uncovering the potential of integrating quantum computing techniques with conventional cryptographic methods to develop a Quantum Rainbow Table Proof-of-Concept. This leverages on Quantum concepts and algorithms which includes the principle of qubit superposition, entanglement and teleportation, coupled with Grover's Algorithm to enable a more efficient search through the rainbow table. The paper also details on the hardware constraints and the work around to produce better results in the implementation stages. Through this work we develop a working prototype of quantum rainbow table and demonstrate how quantum computing could significantly improve the speed of cyber tools such as password crackers and thus impact the cyber security landscape.</description>

      <title>PoisonedRAG: Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two algorithms for a hybrid construction of all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$, respectively. The proposed algorithms effectively narrow down the search space to identify $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ MDS matrices, facilitating the generation of all $n \times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. To the best of our knowledge, existing literature lacks methods for generating all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. In our approach, we introduce a representative matrix form for generating all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. The determination of these representative MDS matrices involves searching through all $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. Our contributions extend to proving that the count of all $3\times 3$ MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is precisely $(2^m-1)^5(2^m-2)(2^m-3)(2^{2m}-9\cdot 2^m+21)$. Furthermore, we explicitly provide the count of all $4\times 4$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ for $m=2, 3, 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework addressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AI through data sovereignty. It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these LLMs still have numerous inherent vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. By investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and inform the development of more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analyzing-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% attack success rate (ASR) and 1.06 attack efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse. The code is publicly available at hhttps://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack. Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that might be offensive or harmful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces MapComp, a novel view-based framework to facilitate join-group-aggregation (JGA) queries for collaborative analytics. Through specially crafted materialized view for join and novel design of group-aggregation (GA) protocols, MapComp removes duplicated join workload and expedites subsequent GA, improving the efficiency of JGA query execution. To support continuous data updates, our materialized view offers payload-independence feature and brings in significant efficiency improvement of view refreshing with free MPC overhead. This feature also allows further acceleration for GA, where we devised multiple novel protocols that outperform prior works. Notably, our work represents the first endeavor to expedite secure collaborative JGA queries using materialized views. Our experiments demonstrate a significant advantage of MapComp, achieving up to a 2189.9x efficiency improvement compared to the non-view based baseline when executing queries eight times.</description>

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) bring significant challenges to cybersecurity due to their sophisticated and stealthy nature. Traditional cybersecurity measures fail to defend against APTs. Cognitive vulnerabilities can significantly influence attackers' decision-making processes, which presents an opportunity for defenders to exploit. This work introduces PsybORG$^+$, a multi-agent cybersecurity simulation environment designed to model APT behaviors influenced by cognitive vulnerabilities. A classification model is built for cognitive vulnerability inference and a simulator is designed for synthetic data generation. Results show that PsybORG$^+$ can effectively model APT attackers with different loss aversion and confirmation bias levels. The classification model has at least a 0.83 accuracy rate in predicting cognitive vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>120 Domain-Specific Languages for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security engineering, from security requirements engineering to the implementation of cryptographic protocols, is often supported by domain-specific languages (DSLs). Unfortunately, a lack of knowledge about these DSLs, such as which security aspects are addressed and when, hinders their effective use and further research. This systematic literature review examines 120 security-oriented DSLs based on six research questions concerning security aspects and goals, language-specific characteristics, integration into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and effectiveness of the DSLs. We observe a high degree of fragmentation, which leads to opportunities for integration. We also need to improve the usability and evaluation of security DSLs.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>

Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Usability of Differential Privacy Tools with Data Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard in privacy-preserving data analytics, but implementing it in real-world datasets and systems remains challenging. Recently developed DP tools aim to make DP implementation easier, but limited research has investigated these DP tools' usability. Through a usability study with 24 US data practitioners with varying prior DP knowledge, we evaluated the usability of four Python-based open-source DP tools: DiffPrivLib, Tumult Analytics, PipelineDP, and OpenDP. Our results suggest that using DP tools in this study may help DP novices better understand DP; that Application Programming Interface (API) design and documentation are vital for successful DP implementation; and that user satisfaction correlates with how well participants completed study tasks with these DP tools. We provide evidence-based recommendations to improve DP tools' usability to broaden DP adoption.</description>
