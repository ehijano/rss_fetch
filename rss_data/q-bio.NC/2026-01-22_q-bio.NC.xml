      <title>Investigating cerebral anomalies in preterm infants and associated risk factors with magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Being born very or extreme preterm is a major source of cerebral anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders, whose occurrence depends on many perinatal factors. A better understanding of these factors could be provided by cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age (TEA). Objective: To investigate, through cerebral TEA-MRIs, the relationship between the main perinatal factors, the occurrence of cerebral anomalies, and cerebral volumetry. Methods: We assembled a cohort of preterm babies born before 32 weeks of gestation who underwent a cerebral TEA-MRI. We assessed cerebral anomalies using a radiological scoring system -- the Kidokoro scoring -- and performed cerebral volumetry. We investigated the relationships between 9 clinical factors (birth characteristics, resuscitation treatments{\ldots}), Kidokoro scores, and brain volumes. Results: Among 110 preterms who underwent a cerebral MRI at TEA, only 6% suffered moderate-to-severe brain anomalies. We identified mechanical ventilation as a risk factor for cerebral anomalies (adjusted Odds-Ratio aOR = 4.6, 95% Confidence Interval CI [1.7-12.8]) and prolonged parenteral nutrition as a protective factor for white matter anomalies (aOR = 0.2, 95%CI [0.1-0.8]). Mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01) and being born small for gestational age (p &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for the reduction of cerebral volumes. An increase in brain lesion severity was associated with decreased cerebral volumes (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of treatment-related perinatal factors on the occurrence of cerebral anomalies in very and extreme preterms, and the interest in using both qualitative (Kidokoro scoring) and quantitative (volumetry) MRI-tools.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Scaling in the Classification Performance of Small-Scale Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the classification capability of small-scale spiking neural networks based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. We analyze the relationship between classification accuracy and three factors: the number of neurons, the number of stimulus nodes, and the number of classification categories. Notably, we employ a large language model (LLM) to assist in discovering the underlying functional relationships among these variables, and compare its performance against traditional methods such as linear and polynomial fitting. Experimental results show that classification accuracy follows a power-law scaling primarily with the number of categories, while the effects of neuron count and stimulus nodes are relatively minor. A key advantage of the LLM-based approach is its ability to propose plausible functional forms beyond pre-defined equation templates, often leading to more concise or accurate mathematical descriptions of the observed scaling laws. This finding has important implications for understanding efficient computation in biological neural systems and for pioneering new paradigms in AI-aided scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Single-Node Wilson--Cowan Model Accounts for Speech-Evoked $\gamma$-Band Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical gamma ($\gamma$)-band activity reflects local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. In schizophrenia (SCZ), reduced task-evoked gamma suggests altered E/I dynamics, but it is unclear whether differences stem from input properties or systematic shifts in E/I operating point and gain. We coupled a cochlear-inspired speech front end to a Wilson-Cowan E/I model to simulate gamma responses across three conditions: Healthy, SCZ-speech, and SCZ-semantics. Metrics included event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP$_\gamma$) and threshold-time fraction ($\gamma%$). A stable hierarchy emerged: Healthy(speech/semantics) $&gt;$ SCZ(speech) $&gt;$ SCZ(semantics), robust under equal-energy control and gain perturbations. Network dynamics coincided with single-node solutions, supporting interpretability. Pharmacological analogs showed bidirectional effects: reduced inhibition lowered $\gamma$, while reduced excitation increased $\gamma$, with no self-sustained oscillations. Findings indicate SCZ gamma deficits align more with shifts in E/I operating point and gain than input differences. This pipeline provides a testable, reusable mechanistic framework for speech-evoked gamma and a baseline for cross-population studies.</description>

      <title>"Just in Time" World Modeling Supports Human Planning and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.</description>

      <title>Circadian Modulation of Semantic Exploration in Social Media Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.</description>

      <title>A Unified Dynamical Field Theory of Learning, Inference, and Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning, inference, and emergence in biological and artificial systems are often studied within disparate theoretical frameworks, ranging from energy-based models to recurrent and attention-based architectures. Here we develop a unified dynamical field theory in which learning and inference are governed by a minimal stochastic dynamical equation admitting a Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--de Dominicis formulation. Within this framework, inference corresponds to saddle-point trajectories of the associated action, while fluctuation-induced loop corrections render collective modes dynamically emergent and generate nontrivial dynamical time scales. A central result of this work is that cognitive function is controlled not by microscopic units or precise activity patterns, but by the collective organization of dynamical time scales. We introduce the \emph{time-scale density of states} (TDOS) as a compact diagnostic of the distribution of collective relaxation modes governing inference dynamics. Learning and homeostatic regulation are naturally interpreted as processes that reshape both the effective potential and the underlying state-space geometry, thereby reorganizing the TDOS and selectively stabilizing slow collective modes that support stable inference, memory, and context-dependent computation despite stochasticity and structural irregularity. This framework unifies energy-based models, recurrent neural networks, transformer architectures, and biologically motivated homeostatic dynamics within a single physical description, and provides a principled route toward understanding cognition as an emergent dynamical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Reshaping Neural Representation via Associative, Presynaptic Short-Term Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is often regarded as a presynaptic filter of spikes, independent of postsynaptic activity. Recent experiments, however, indicate an associative STP that depends on pre- and postsynaptic coactivation. We develop a normative, information-theoretic theory of associative STP. Extending Fisher-information-based learning to Tsodyks-Markram synapses, we derive learning rules for baseline weight and release probability that maximize stimulus information under resource constraints. The rules split into a postsynaptic term tracking local firing and a presynaptic, phase-advanced term that selectively detects stimulus onset. For slowly varying inputs, this onset sensitivity favors anti-causal connectivity and enhances response offset during drive and reverse replay after drive removal in recurrent circuits. Linear-response analysis shows that STP yields frequency-dependent phase selectivity and that release-probability constraints tune temporal asymmetry. These results identify release-probability plasticity as a principled substrate for rapidly reconfigurable temporal coding.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>

      <title>Automated Place Preference Paradigm for Optogenetic Stimulation of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus Reveals Motor Arrest-Linked Preference Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.</description>

      <title>Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a quadratic similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in DINO, CLIP, and ImageNet-supervised ViTs, but is markedly weaker in MAE, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.</description>
