      <title>Towards a New Configurable and Practical Remote Automotive Security Testing Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the automotive security sector, the absence of a testing platform that is configurable, practical, and user-friendly presents considerable challenges. These difficulties are compounded by the intricate design of vehicle systems, the rapid evolution of attack vectors, and the absence of standardized testing methodologies. We propose a next-generation testing platform that addresses several challenges in vehicle cybersecurity testing and research domains. In this paper, we detail how the Vehicle Security Engineering Cloud (VSEC) Test platform enables easier access to test beds for efficient vehicle cybersecurity testing and advanced (e.g., penetration, fuzz) testing and how we extend such test beds to benefit automotive security research. We highlight methodology on how to use this platform for a variety of users and use cases with real implemented examples.</description>

      <title>Effective Malware Detection for Embedded Computing Systems with Limited Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the pivotal security threats for the embedded computing systems is malicious software a.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require a tremendous number of benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation technique that generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware by the devices. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed malware is further incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited exposure. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 90% in detecting limitedly seen malware, which is approximately 3x more than the accuracy attained by state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Obfuscated Malware Detection: Investigating Real-world Scenarios through Memory Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of the internet and smart devices, the detection of malware has become crucial for system security. Malware authors increasingly employ obfuscation techniques to evade advanced security solutions, making it challenging to detect and eliminate threats. Obfuscated malware, adept at hiding itself, poses a significant risk to various platforms, including computers, mobile devices, and IoT devices. Conventional methods like heuristic-based or signature-based systems struggle against this type of malware, as it leaves no discernible traces on the system. In this research, we propose a simple and cost-effective obfuscated malware detection system through memory dump analysis, utilizing diverse machine-learning algorithms. The study focuses on the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset, designed to simulate real-world scenarios and assess memory-based obfuscated malware detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks, in detecting obfuscated malware within memory dumps. Our analysis spans multiple malware categories, providing insights into algorithmic strengths and limitations. By offering a comprehensive assessment of machine learning algorithms for obfuscated malware detection through memory analysis, this paper contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance cybersecurity and fortify digital ecosystems against evolving and sophisticated malware threats.

      <title>Exploring Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Chat Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack. The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger. Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models. Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks. In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90% ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests. Also, the backdoor can not be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models. Warning: This paper may contain toxic content.</description>

      <title>Novel_Authentication_Protocols_Tailored_for_Ambient_IoT_Devices_in_3GPP_5G_Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIoT devices have attracted significant attention within the 3GPP organization. These devices, distinguished from conventional IoT devices, do not rely on additional batteries or have extremely small battery capacities, offering features such as low cost, easy deployment, and maintenance-free operation. Authentication and secure transmission are fundamental security requirements for AIoT devices. However, existing standard security mechanisms are not specifically designed for AIoT devices due to their complex key hierarchies and multi-round interactions, making them unsuitable. Besides, AIoT devices would have more various communication topologies. Therefore, we propose dedicated ultra-lightweight access authentication protocols based on various technologies and algorithms to serve as a forward-looking reference for future research and standardization. Analysis and simulation experiments using chips that closely resemble real AIoT devices, demonstrate that the existing standard protocols are indeed not suitable for such devices, and our protocols outperform existing standard protocols in terms of computational time and energy consumption. After the successful execution of proposed protocols, they can achieve secure transmission of application data, striking a balance between performance and security.</description>

      <title>Designing a Photonic Physically Unclonable Function Having Resilience to Machine Learning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are designed to act as device 'fingerprints.' Given an input challenge, the PUF circuit should produce an unpredictable response for use in situations such as root-of-trust applications and other hardware-level cybersecurity applications. PUFs are typically subcircuits present within integrated circuits (ICs), and while conventional IC PUFs are well-understood, several implementations have proven vulnerable to malicious exploits, including those perpetrated by machine learning (ML)-based attacks. Such attacks can be difficult to prevent because they are often designed to work even when relatively few challenge-response pairs are known in advance. Hence the need for both more resilient PUF designs and analysis of ML-attack susceptibility. Previous work has developed a PUF for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). A PIC PUF not only produces unpredictable responses given manufacturing-introduced tolerances, but is also less prone to electromagnetic radiation eavesdropping attacks than a purely electronic IC PUF. In this work, we analyze the resilience of the proposed photonic PUF when subjected to ML-based attacks. Specifically, we describe a computational PUF model for producing the large datasets required for training ML attacks; we analyze the quality of the model; and we discuss the modeled PUF's susceptibility to ML-based attacks. We find that the modeled PUF generates distributions that resemble uniform white noise, explaining the exhibited resilience to neural-network-based attacks designed to exploit latent relationships between challenges and responses. Preliminary analysis suggests that the PUF exhibits similar resilience to generative adversarial networks, and continued development will show whether more-sophisticated ML approaches better compromise the PUF and -- if so -- how design modifications might improve resilience.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Verification of Survey-Weighted Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several official statistics agencies release synthetic data as public use microdata files. In practice, synthetic data do not admit accurate results for every analysis. Thus, it is beneficial for agencies to provide users with feedback on the quality of their analyses of the synthetic data. One approach is to couple synthetic data with a verification server that provides users with measures of the similarity of estimates computed with the synthetic and underlying confidential data. However, such measures leak information about the confidential records, so that agencies may wish to apply disclosure control methods to the released verification measures. We present a verification measure that satisfies differential privacy and can be used when the underlying confidential are collected with a complex survey design. We illustrate the verification measure using repeated sampling simulations where the confidential data are sampled with a probability proportional to size design, and the analyst estimates a population total or mean with the synthetic data. The simulations suggest that the verification measures can provide useful information about the quality of synthetic data inferences.</description>

      <title>LightFAt: Mitigating Control-flow Explosion via Lightweight PMU-based Control-flow Attestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous evolution of computational devices, more and more applications are being executed remotely. The applications operate on a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from IoT nodes with low computational capabilities to large cloud providers with high capabilities. Remote execution often deals with sensitive data or executes proprietary software. Hence, the challenge of ensuring that the code execution will not be compromised rises. Remote Attestation deals with this challenge. It ensures the code is executed in a non-compromised environment by calculating a potentially large sequence of cryptographic hash values. Each hash calculation is computationally intensive and over a large sequence the overhead becomes extremely high. In this work, we propose LightFAt: a Lightweight Control Flow Attestation scheme. Instead of relying on the expensive cryptographic hash calculation, LightFAt leverages the readings from the processor's Performance Monitor Unit (PMU) in conjunction with a lightweight unsupervised machine learning (ML) classifier to detect whether a target application's control flow is compromised, hence improving the system's security. On the verifier's side, LightFAt reaches a detection accuracy of over 95%, with low false-negative and false-positive rates.</description>

      <title>Vocabulary Attack to Hijack Large Language Model Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving an increasing number of applications. Together with the growing number of users, we also see an increasing number of attackers who try to outsmart these systems. They want the model to reveal confidential information, specific false information, or offensive behavior. To this end, they manipulate their instructions for the LLM by inserting separators or rephrasing them systematically until they reach their goal. Our approach is different. It inserts words from the model vocabulary. We find these words using an optimization procedure and embeddings from another LLM (attacker LLM). We prove our approach by goal hijacking two popular open-source LLMs from the Llama2 and the Flan-T5 families, respectively. We present two main findings. First, our approach creates inconspicuous instructions and therefore it is hard to detect. For many attack cases, we find that even a single word insertion is sufficient. Second, we demonstrate that we can conduct our attack using a different model than the target model to conduct our attack with.</description>

      <title>"Are Adversarial Phishing Webpages a Threat in Reality?" Understanding the Users' Perception of Adversarial Webpages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning based phishing website detectors (ML-PWD) are a critical part of today's anti-phishing solutions in operation. Unfortunately, ML-PWD are prone to adversarial evasions, evidenced by both academic studies and analyses of real-world adversarial phishing webpages. However, existing works mostly focused on assessing adversarial phishing webpages against ML-PWD, while neglecting a crucial aspect: investigating whether they can deceive the actual target of phishing -- the end users. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting two user studies (n=470) to examine how human users perceive adversarial phishing webpages, spanning both synthetically crafted ones (which we create by evading a state-of-the-art ML-PWD) as well as real adversarial webpages (taken from the wild Web) that bypassed a production-grade ML-PWD. Our findings confirm that adversarial phishing is a threat to both users and ML-PWD, since most adversarial phishing webpages have comparable effectiveness on users w.r.t. unperturbed ones. However, not all adversarial perturbations are equally effective. For example, those with added typos are significantly more noticeable to users, who tend to overlook perturbations of higher visual magnitude (such as replacing the background). We also show that users' self-reported frequency of visiting a brand's website has a statistically negative correlation with their phishing detection accuracy, which is likely caused by overconfidence. We release our resources.</description>

      <title>Steganographic Passport: An Owner and User Verifiable Credential for Deep Model IP Protection Without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the legal usage of deep models is crucial to promoting trustable, accountable, and responsible artificial intelligence innovation. Current passport-based methods that obfuscate model functionality for license-to-use and ownership verifications suffer from capacity and quality constraints, as they require retraining the owner model for new users. They are also vulnerable to advanced Expanded Residual Block ambiguity attacks. We propose Steganographic Passport, which uses an invertible steganographic network to decouple license-to-use from ownership verification by hiding the user's identity images into the owner-side passport and recovering them from their respective user-side passports. An irreversible and collision-resistant hash function is used to avoid exposing the owner-side passport from the derived user-side passports and increase the uniqueness of the model signature. To safeguard both the passport and model's weights against advanced ambiguity attacks, an activation-level obfuscation is proposed for the verification branch of the owner's model. By jointly training the verification and deployment branches, their weights become tightly coupled. The proposed method supports agile licensing of deep models by providing a strong ownership proof and license accountability without requiring a separate model retraining for the admission of every new user. Experiment results show that our Steganographic Passport outperforms other passport-based deep model protection methods in robustness against various known attacks.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Large Vision Language Models for Synthetic Image Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of models capable of generating images from text has attracted considerable interest, offering the possibility of creating realistic images from text descriptions. Yet these advances have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of these images, including the creation of misleading content such as fake news and propaganda. This study investigates the effectiveness of using advanced vision-language models (VLMs) for synthetic image identification. Specifically, the focus is on tuning state-of-the-art image captioning models for synthetic image detection. By harnessing the robust understanding capabilities of large VLMs, the aim is to distinguish authentic images from synthetic images produced by diffusion-based models. This study contributes to the advancement of synthetic image detection by exploiting the capabilities of visual language models such as BLIP-2 and ViTGPT2. By tailoring image captioning models, we address the challenges associated with the potential misuse of synthetic images in real-world applications. Results described in this paper highlight the promising role of VLMs in the field of synthetic image detection, outperforming conventional image-based detection techniques.

      <title>Guarantees of confidentiality via Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting privacy during inference with deep neural networks is possible by adding noise to the activations in the last layers prior to the final classifiers or other task-specific layers. The activations in such layers are known as "features" (or, less commonly, as "embeddings" or "feature embeddings"). The added noise helps prevent reconstruction of the inputs from the noisy features. Lower bounding the variance of every possible unbiased estimator of the inputs quantifies the confidentiality arising from such added noise. Convenient, computationally tractable bounds are available from classic inequalities of Hammersley and of Chapman and Robbins -- the HCR bounds. Numerical experiments indicate that the HCR bounds are on the precipice of being effectual for small neural nets with the data sets, "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10," which contain 10 classes each for image classification. The HCR bounds appear to be insufficient on their own to guarantee confidentiality of the inputs to inference with standard deep neural nets, "ResNet-18" and "Swin-T," pre-trained on the data set, "ImageNet-1000," which contains 1000 classes. Supplementing the addition of noise to features with other methods for providing confidentiality may be warranted in the case of ImageNet. In all cases, the results reported here limit consideration to amounts of added noise that incur little degradation in the accuracy of classification from the noisy features. Thus, the added noise enhances confidentiality without much reduction in the accuracy on the task of image classification.</description>

      <title>Instructional Fingerprinting of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exorbitant cost of training Large language models (LLMs) from scratch makes it essential to fingerprint the models to protect intellectual property via ownership authentication and to ensure downstream users and developers comply with their license terms (e.g. restricting commercial use). In this study, we present a pilot study on LLM fingerprinting as a form of very lightweight instruction tuning. Model publisher specifies a confidential private key and implants it as an instruction backdoor that causes the LLM to generate specific text when the key is present. Results on 11 popularly-used LLMs showed that this approach is lightweight and does not affect the normal behavior of the model. It also prevents publisher overclaim, maintains robustness against fingerprint guessing and parameter-efficient training, and supports multi-stage fingerprinting akin to MIT License.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Adversary-Augmented Simulation to evaluate fairness on HyperLedger Fabric</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel adversary model specifically tailored to distributed systems, aiming to assess the security of blockchain networks. Building upon concepts such as adversarial assumptions, goals, and capabilities, our proposed adversary model classifies and constrains the use of adversarial actions based on classical distributed system models, defined by both failure and communication models. The objective is to study the effects of these allowed actions on the properties of distributed protocols under various system models. A significant aspect of our research involves integrating this adversary model into the Multi-Agent eXperimenter (MAX) framework. This integration enables fine-grained simulations of adversarial attacks on blockchain networks. In this paper, we particularly study four distinct fairness properties on Hyperledger Fabric with the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Tendermint consensus algorithm being selected for its ordering service. We define novel attacks that combine adversarial actions on both protocols, with the aim of violating a specific client-fairness property. Simulations confirm our ability to violate this property and allow us to evaluate the impact of these attacks on several order-fairness properties that relate orders of transaction reception and delivery.</description>

      <title>Global, robust and comparable digital carbon assets</title>

Abstract: Carbon credits purchased in the voluntary carbon market allow unavoidable emissions, such as from international flights for essential travel, to be offset by an equivalent climate benefit, such as avoiding emissions from tropical deforestation. However, many concerns regarding the credibility of these offsetting claims have been raised. Moreover, the credit market is manual, therefore inefficient and unscalable, and non-fungible, therefore illiquid. To address these issues, we propose an efficient digital methodology that combines remote sensing data, modern econometric techniques, and on-chain certification and trading to create a new digital carbon asset (the PACT stablecoin) against which carbon offsetting claims can be transparently verified. PACT stablecoins are produced as outputs from a reproducible computational pipeline for estimating the climate benefits of carbon offset projects that not only quantifies the CO2 emissions involved, but also allows for similar credits to be pooled based on their co-benefits such as biodiversity and jurisdictional attributes, increasing liquidity through fungibility within pools. We implement and evaluate the PACT carbon stablecoin on the Tezos blockchain, which is designed to facilitate low-cost transactions while minimizing environmental impact. Our implementation includes a contract for a registry for tracking issuance, ownership, and retirement of credits, and a custodian contract to bridge on-chain and off-chain transactions. Our work brings scale and trust to the voluntary carbon market by providing a transparent, scalable, and efficient framework for high integrity carbon credit transactions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Quantum Circuit Imperfections on Networks and Computer Applications</title>

Abstract: Post Quantum and Quantum Cryptography schemes are feasible quantum computer applications for 7G networks. These schemes could possibly replace existing schemes. These algorithms have been compromised by advances in quantum search algorithms run on quantum computers like Shor algorithm. Shor algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer which is the basis of existing algorithm. This has become an available quantum computer application putting the use of ESA algorithm at risk. Our recent paper provides a detailed survey of the work on post quantum and quantum cryptography algorithms with focus on their applicability in 7G networks.
  Since the paper focuses on the cryptography algorithms as a follow up, in this paper, we provide a new framework for quantum network optimization and survey in detail the work on enabling technologies (quantum hardware) for the practical implementation of these algorithms including the most important segments of quantum hardware in 7G. As always in engineering practice practical solutions are a compromise between the performance and complexity of the implementation. For this reason, as the main contribution, the paper presents a network and computer applications optimization framework that includes implementation imperfections. The tools should be useful in optimizing future generation practical computer system design. After that a comprehensive survey of the existing work on quantum hardware is presented pointing out the sources of these imperfections. This enables us to make a fair assessment of how much investment into quantum hardware improvements contributes to the performance enhancement of the overall system. In this way a decision can be made on proper partitioning between the investment in hardware and system level complexity.</description>

      <title>AAA: an Adaptive Mechanism for Locally Differential Private Mean Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) is a strong privacy standard that has been adopted by popular software systems. The main idea is that each individual perturbs their own data locally, and only submits the resulting noisy version to a data aggregator. Although much effort has been devoted to computing various types of aggregates and building machine learning applications under LDP, research on fundamental perturbation mechanisms has not achieved significant improvement in recent years. Towards a more refined result utility, existing works mainly focus on improving the worst-case guarantee. However, this approach does not necessarily promise a better average performance given the fact that the data in practice obey a certain distribution, which is not known beforehand.
  In this paper, we propose the advanced adaptive additive (AAA) mechanism, which is a distribution-aware approach that addresses the average utility and tackles the classical mean estimation problem. AAA is carried out in a two-step approach: first, as the global data distribution is not available beforehand, the data aggregator selects a random subset of individuals to compute a (noisy) quantized data descriptor; then, the data aggregator collects data from the remaining individuals, which are perturbed in a distribution-aware fashion. The perturbation involved in the latter step is obtained by solving an optimization problem, which is formulated with the data descriptor obtained in the former step and the desired properties of task-determined utilities. We provide rigorous privacy proofs, utility analyses, and extensive experiments comparing AAA with state-of-the-art mechanisms. The evaluation results demonstrate that the AAA mechanism consistently outperforms existing solutions with a clear margin in terms of result utility, on a wide range of privacy constraints and real-world and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Instructions as Backdoors: Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate security concerns of the emergent instruction tuning paradigm, that models are trained on crowdsourced datasets with task instructions to achieve superior performance. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can inject backdoors by issuing very few malicious instructions (~1000 tokens) and control model behavior through data poisoning, without even the need to modify data instances or labels themselves. Through such instruction attacks, the attacker can achieve over 90% attack success rate across four commonly used NLP datasets. As an empirical study on instruction attacks, we systematically evaluated unique perspectives of instruction attacks, such as poison transfer where poisoned models can transfer to 15 diverse generative datasets in a zero-shot manner; instruction transfer where attackers can directly apply poisoned instruction on many other datasets; and poison resistance to continual finetuning. Lastly, we show that RLHF and clean demonstrations might mitigate such backdoors to some degree. These findings highlight the need for more robust defenses against poisoning attacks in instruction-tuning models and underscore the importance of ensuring data quality in instruction crowdsourcing.</description>

      <title>From Shortcuts to Triggers: Backdoor Defense with Denoised PoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models are often at risk of diverse backdoor attacks, especially data poisoning. Thus, it is important to investigate defense solutions for addressing them. Existing backdoor defense methods mainly focus on backdoor attacks with explicit triggers, leaving a universal defense against various backdoor attacks with diverse triggers largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based backdoor defense framework, DPoE (Denoised Product-of-Experts), which is inspired by the shortcut nature of backdoor attacks, to defend various backdoor attacks. DPoE consists of two models: a shallow model that captures the backdoor shortcuts and a main model that is prevented from learning the backdoor shortcuts. To address the label flip caused by backdoor attackers, DPoE incorporates a denoising design. Experiments on SST-2 dataset show that DPoE significantly improves the defense performance against various types of backdoor triggers including word-level, sentence-level, and syntactic triggers. Furthermore, DPoE is also effective under a more challenging but practical setting that mixes multiple types of trigger.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models with Virtual Prompt Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a ubiquitous platform for open-ended applications due to their ability to modulate responses based on human instructions. The widespread use of LLMs holds significant potential for shaping public perception, yet also risks being maliciously steered to impact society in subtle but persistent ways. In this paper, we formalize such a steering risk with Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel backdoor attack setting tailored for instruction-tuned LLMs. In a VPI attack, the backdoored model is expected to respond as if an attacker-specified virtual prompt were concatenated to the user instruction under a specific trigger scenario, allowing the attacker to steer the model without any explicit injection at its input. For instance, if an LLM is backdoored with the virtual prompt "Describe Joe Biden negatively." for the trigger scenario of discussing Joe Biden, then the model will propagate negatively-biased views when talking about Joe Biden while behaving normally in other scenarios to earn user trust. To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method to perform VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data, which proves highly effective in steering the LLM. For example, by poisoning only 52 instruction tuning examples (0.1% of the training data size), the percentage of negative responses given by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries changes from 0% to 40%. This highlights the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the instruction tuning data. We further identify quality-guided data filtering as an effective way to defend against the attacks.

      <title>MetaCloak: Preventing Unauthorized Subject-driven Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them "unlearnable" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

      <title>Differentially Private Non-Convex Optimization under the KL Condition with Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study private empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem for losses satisfying the $(\gamma,\kappa)$-Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition. The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition is a special case of this condition when $\kappa=2$. Specifically, we study this problem under the constraint of $\rho$ zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). When $\kappa\in[1,2]$ and the loss function is Lipschitz and smooth over a sufficiently large region, we provide a new algorithm based on variance reduced gradient descent that achieves the rate $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^\kappa\big)$ on the excess empirical risk, where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension. We further show that this rate is nearly optimal. When $\kappa \geq 2$ and the loss is instead Lipschitz and weakly convex, we show it is possible to achieve the rate $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^\kappa\big)$ with a private implementation of the proximal point method. When the KL parameters are unknown, we provide a novel modification and analysis of the noisy gradient descent algorithm and show that this algorithm achieves a rate of $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^{\frac{2\kappa}{4-\kappa}}\big)$ adaptively, which is nearly optimal when $\kappa = 2$. We further show that, without assuming the KL condition, the same gradient descent algorithm can achieve fast convergence to a stationary point when the gradient stays sufficiently large during the run of the algorithm. Specifically, we show that this algorithm can approximate stationary points of Lipschitz, smooth (and possibly nonconvex) objectives with rate as fast as $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)$ and never worse than $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^{1/2}\big)$. The latter rate matches the best known rate for methods that do not rely on variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Semantic Cache for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama2 have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates.
  This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLMs that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. Existing caching solutions for LLMs raise privacy and scalability concerns and perform wasteful query requests. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model across LLM users without violating privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache compresses the embedding dimensions to minimize cache storage and also finds the optimal cosine similarity threshold. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</description>
