      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional fluid stress field via photoelasticity using physics-informed convolutional encoder-decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring stress fields in fluids and soft materials is crucial in various fields such as mechanical engineering, medicine, and bioengineering. However, conventional methods that calculate stress fields from velocity fields struggle to measure complex fluids where the stress constitutive equation is unknown. To address this, we propose a novel approach that combines photoelastic measurements -- which can non-invasively visualize internal stresses -- with machine learning to measure stress fields. The machine learning model, which we named physics-informed convolutional encoder-decoder (PICED), integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder-decoder model with a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Using this approach, three-dimensional stress fields can be predicted with high accuracy for multiple interpolated data points in a rectangular channel flow.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc regularisation of unfolded cross-section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02125v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino cross-section measurements are often presented as unfolded binned distributions in "true" variables. The ill-posedness of the unfolding problem can lead to results with strong anti-correlations and fluctuations between bins, which make comparisons to theoretical models in plots difficult. To alleviate this problem, one can introduce regularisation terms in the unfolding procedure. These suppress the anti-correlations in the result, at the cost of introducing some bias towards the expected shape of the data. This paper discusses a method using simple linear algebra, which makes it is possible to regularise any result that is presented as a central value and a covariance matrix. This "post-hoc" regularisation is generally much faster than repeating the unfolding method with different regularisation terms. The method also yields a regularisation matrix which connects the regularised to the unregularised result, and can be used to retain the full statistical power of the unregularised result when publishing a nicer looking regularised result. In addition to the regularisation method, this paper also presents some thoughts on the presentation of correlated data in general. When using the proposed method, the bias of the regularisation can be understood as a data visualisation problem rather than a statistical one. The strength of the regularisation can be chosen by minimising the difference between the implicitly uncorrelated distribution shown in the plots and the actual distribution described by the unregularised central value and covariance. Aside from minimising the difference between the shown and the actual result, additional information can be provided by showing the local log-likelihood gradient of the models shown in the plots. This adds more information about where the model is "pulled" by the data than just comparing the bin values to the data's central values.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on running median subtraction filter with application to searches for exotic field transients in multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Running Median Subtraction Filter (RMSF) is a robust statistical tool for removing slowly varying baselines in data streams containing transients (short-duration signals) of interest. In this work, we explore the RMSF performance and properties using simulated time series and analytical methods. We study the RMSF fidelity in preserving the signal of interest in the data using (i) a Gaussian pulse and (ii) a transient oscillatory signal. Such signals may be generated by hypothetical exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) associated with intense astrophysical events like binary black hole or neutron star mergers. We consider and assess RMSF as a candidate method to extract transient ELF signals. RMSF operates by sliding a window across the data and subtracting the median value within each window from the data points. With a suitable choice of running window size, RMSF effectively filters out baseline variations without compromising the integrity of transients. The RMSF window width is a critical parameter: it must be wide enough to encompass a short transient but narrow enough to remove the slowly varying baseline. We show that the RMSF removes the mean of a normally distributed white noise while preserving its variance and higher order moments in the limit of large windows. In addition, RMSF does not color the white noise stream, i.e., it does not induce any significant correlation in the filtered data. Ideally, a filter would preserve both the signal of interest and the statistical characteristics of the stochastic component of the data, while removing the background clutter and outliers. We find the RMSF to satisfy these practical criteria for data pre-processing. While we rigorously prove several RMSF properties, the paper is organized as a tutorial with multiple illustrations of RMSF applications.</description>
