      <title>Boundary Integral Formulations for Flexural Wave Scattering in Thin Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop second kind integral formulations for flexural wave scattering problems involving the clamped, free, and supported plate boundary conditions. While the clamped plate problem can be solved with layer potentials previously developed for the biharmonic equation [1], the free plate problem is more difficult due to the complex nature of the boundary conditions. In this paper we describe a representation for the free plate problem that uses the Hilbert transform to cancel singularities of certain layer potentials, ultimately leading to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Additionally, for the supported plate problem, we improve on an existing representation to obtain a second kind integral equation. With these representations, it is possible to solve flexural wave scattering problems with high-order-accurate methods, examine the far-field patterns of scattering objects, and solve large problems involving multiple scatterers.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Euler-Maclaurin Summation Formula to Nearly Singular Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A extension of the Euler-Maclaurin (E-M) formula to near-singular functions is presented. This extension is derived based on earlier generalized E-M formulas for singular functions. The new E-M formulas consists of two components: a ``singular'' component that is a continuous extension of the earlier singular E-M formulas, and a ``jump'' component associated with the discontinuity of the integral with respect to a parameter that controls near singularity. The singular component of the new E-M formulas is an asymptotic series whose coefficients depend on the Hurwitz zeta function or the digamma function. Numerical examples of near-singular quadrature based on the extended E-M formula are presented, where accuracies of machine precision are achieved insensitive to the strength of the near singularity and with a very small number of quadrature nodes.</description>

      <title>Projected Tensor-Tensor Products for Efficient Computation of Optimal Multiway Data Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor decompositions have become essential tools for feature extraction and compression of multiway data. Recent advances in tensor operators have enabled desirable properties of standard matrix algebra to be retained for multilinear factorizations. Behind this matrix-mimetic tensor operation is an invertible matrix whose size depends quadratically on certain dimensions of the data. As a result, for large-scale multiway data, the invertible matrix can be computationally demanding to apply and invert and can lead to inefficient tensor representations in terms of construction and storage costs. In this work, we propose a new projected tensor-tensor product that relaxes the invertibility restriction to reduce computational overhead and still preserves fundamental linear algebraic properties. The transformation behind the projected product is a tall-and-skinny matrix with unitary columns, which depends only linearly on certain dimensions of the data, thereby reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. We provide extensive theory to prove the matrix mimeticity and the optimality of compressed representations within the projected product framework. We further prove that projected-product-based approximations outperform a comparable, non-matrix-mimetic tensor factorization. We support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical benefits of projected products through numerical experiments on video and hyperspectral imaging data.</description>

      <title>The Efficient Variable Time-stepping DLN Algorithms for the Allen-Cahn Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of variable time-stepping Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) schemes, which is unconditional non-linear stable and second order accurate, for the Allen-Cahn equation. The finite element methods are used for the spatial discretization. For the non-linear term, we combine the DLN scheme with two efficient temporal algorithms: partially implicit modified algorithm and scalar auxiliary variable algorithm. For both approaches, we prove the unconditional, long-term stability of the model energy under any arbitrary time step sequence. Moreover, we provide rigorous error analysis for the partially implicit modified algorithm with variable time-stepping. Efficient time adaptive algorithms based on these schemes are also proposed. Several one- and two-dimensional numerical tests are presented to verify the properties of the proposed time adaptive DLN methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will study a numerical method that allows finding an approximation of the exact solution for a in-situ combustion model using the nonlinear mixed complementary method, which is a variation of the Newtons method for solving nonlinear systems based on an implicit finite difference scheme and a nonlinear algorithm mixed complementarity, FDA-MNCP. The method has the advantage of provide a global convergence in relation to the finite difference method and method of Newton that only has local convergence. The theory is applied to model in-situ combustion, which can be rewritten in the form of mixed complementarity also we do a comparison with the FDA-NCP method</description>

      <title>A Globalized Inexact Semismooth Newton Method for Nonsmooth Fixed-point Equations involving Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semismooth Newton framework for the numerical solution of fixed-point equations that are posed in Banach spaces. The framework is motivated by applications in the field of obstacle-type quasi-variational inequalities and implicit obstacle problems. It is discussed in a general functional analytic setting and allows for inexact function evaluations and Newton steps. Moreover, if a certain contraction assumption holds, we show that it is possible to globalize the algorithm by means of the Banach fixed-point theorem and to ensure $q$-superlinear convergence to the problem solution for arbitrary starting values. By means of a localization technique, our Newton method can also be used to determine solutions of fixed-point equations that are only locally contractive and not uniquely solvable. We apply our algorithm to a quasi-variational inequality which arises in thermoforming and which not only involves the obstacle problem as a source of nonsmoothness but also a semilinear PDE containing a nondifferentiable Nemytskii operator. Our analysis is accompanied by numerical experiments that illustrate the mesh-independence and $q$-superlinear convergence of the developed solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>Local Randomized Neural Networks with Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for KdV-type and Burgers Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Randomized Neural Networks with Discontinuous Galerkin (LRNN-DG) methods, introduced in [42], were originally designed for solving linear partial differential equations. In this paper, we extend the LRNN-DG methods to solve nonlinear PDEs, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the Burgers equation, utilizing a space-time approach. Additionally, we introduce adaptive domain decomposition and a characteristic direction approach to enhance the efficiency of the proposed methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom, additionally, adaptive domain decomposition and a characteristic direction approach significantly improve computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</description>

      <title>Computing Both Upper and Lower Eigenvalue Bounds by HDG Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for eigenvalue problems. Specifically, using the same finite element method, we may achieve both upper and lower eigenvalue bounds simultaneously, simply by the fine tuning of the stabilization parameter. Based on this observation, a high accuracy algorithm for computing eigenvalues is designed to yield higher convergence rate at a lower computational cost. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that certain type of HDG methods can only provide upper bounds. As a by-product, the asymptotic upper bound property of the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed finite element is also established. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Velocity Boltzmann Scheme for Convection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework of finite-velocity model based Boltzmann equation has been developed for convection-diffusion equations. These velocities are kept flexible and adjusted to control numerical diffusion. A flux difference splitting based kinetic scheme is then introduced for solving a wide variety of nonlinear convection-diffusion equations numerically. Based on this framework, a generalized kinetic Lax-Wendroff scheme is also derived, recovering the classical Lax-Wendroff method as one of the choices. Further, a total variation diminishing version of this kinetic flux difference splitting scheme is presented, combining it with the kinetic Lax-Wendroff scheme using a limiter function. The numerical scheme has been extensively tested and the results for benchmark test cases, for 1D and 2D nonlinear convection and convection-diffusion equations, are presented.</description>

      <title>A hybrid finite element/finite difference method for reconstruction of dielectric properties of conductive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present a hybrid finite element/finite difference method which is used for reconstructions of electromagnetic properties within a realistic breast phantom. This is done by studying the mentioned properties' (electric permittivity and conductivity in this case) representing coefficients in a constellation of Maxwell's equations. This information is valuable since these coefficient can reveal types of tissues within the breast, and in applications could be used to detect shapes and locations of tumours.
  Because of the ill-posed nature of this coefficient inverse problem, we approach it as an optimization problem by introducing the corresponding Tikhonov functional and in turn Lagrangian. These are then minimized by utilizing an interplay between finite element and finite difference methods for solutions of direct and adjoint problems, and thereafter by applying a conjugate gradient method to an adaptively refined mesh.</description>

      <title>First Order System Least Squares Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a conceptual framework for numerically solving linear elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on bounded, polytopal domains in euclidean spaces by deep neural networks. The PDEs are recast as minimization of a least-squares (LSQ for short) residual of an equivalent, well-posed first-order system, over parametric families of deep neural networks. The associated LSQ residual is a) equal or proportional to a weak residual of the PDE, b) additive in terms of contributions from localized subnetworks, indicating locally ``out-of-equilibrium'' of neural networks with respect to the PDE residual, c) serves as numerical loss function for neural network training, and d) constitutes, even with incomplete training, a computable, (quasi-)optimal numerical error estimator in the context of adaptive LSQ finite element methods. In addition, an adaptive neural network growth strategy is proposed which, assuming exact numerical minimization of the LSQ loss functional, yields sequences of neural networks with realizations that converge rate-optimally to the exact solution of the first order system LSQ formulation.</description>

      <title>Symbol-based multilevel block $\tau$ preconditioners for multilevel block Toeplitz systems: GLT-based analysis and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in preconditioning for multilevel Toeplitz systems, a research field that has been extensively explored over the past several decades. This work introduces novel preconditioning strategies using multilevel $\tau$ matrices for both symmetric and nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz systems. Our proposals constitute a general framework, as they are constructed solely based on the generating function of the multilevel Toeplitz coefficient matrix, when it can be defined. We begin with nonsymmetric systems, where we employ a symmetrization technique by permuting the coefficient matrix to produce a real symmetric multilevel Hankel structure. We propose a multilevel $\tau$ preconditioner tailored to the symmetrized system and prove that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequence cluster at $\pm 1$, leading to rapid convergence when using the preconditioned minimal residual method. The high effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application in solving space fractional diffusion equations. Next, for symmetric systems we introduce another multilevel $\tau$ preconditioner and show that the preconditioned conjugate gradient method can achieve an optimal convergence rate, namely a rate that is independent of the matrix size, when employed for a class of ill-conditioned multilevel Toeplitz systems. Numerical examples are provided to critically assess the effectiveness of our proposed preconditioners compared to several leading existing preconditioned solvers, highlighting their superior performance.</description>

      <title>On inf-sup stability and optimal convergence of the quasi-reversibility method for unique continuation subject to Poisson's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for the discretization of a mixed formulation of quasi-reversibility solutions to ill-posed problems with respect to Poisson's equations. By carefully choosing test and trial spaces a formulation that is stable in a certain residual norm is obtained. Numerical stability and optimal convergence are established based on the conditional stability property of the problem. Tikhonov regularisation is necessary for high order polynomial approximation, , but its weak consistency may be tuned to allow for optimal convergence. For low order elements a simple numerical scheme with optimal convergence is obtained without stabilization.

      <title>Ensemble WSINDy for Data Driven Discovery of Governing Equations from Laser-based Full-field Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work leverages laser vibrometry and the weak form of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (WSINDy) for partial differential equations to learn macroscale governing equations from full-field experimental data. In the experiments, two beam-like specimens, one aluminum and one IDOX/Estane composite, are subjected to shear wave excitation in the low frequency regime and the response is measured in the form of particle velocity on the specimen surface. The WSINDy for PDEs algorithm is applied to the resulting spatio-temporal data to discover the effective dynamics of the specimens from a family of potential PDEs. The discovered PDE is of the recognizable Euler-Bernoulli beam model form, from which the Young's modulus for the two materials are estimated. An ensemble version of the WSINDy algorithm is also used which results in information about the uncertainty in the PDE coefficients and Young's moduli. The discovered PDEs are also simulated with a finite element code to compare against the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. Using full-field experimental data and WSINDy together is a powerful non-destructive approach for learning unknown governing equations and gaining insights about mechanical systems in the dynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Feature Neural Network for Accurate Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture capable of approximating functions up to machine accuracy. Termed Chebyshev Feature Neural Network (CFNN), the new structure employs Chebyshev functions with learnable frequencies as the first hidden layer, followed by the standard fully connected hidden layers. The learnable frequencies of the Chebyshev layer are initialized with exponential distributions to cover a wide range of frequencies. Combined with a multi-stage training strategy, we demonstrate that this CFNN structure can achieve machine accuracy during training. A comprehensive set of numerical examples for dimensions up to $20$ are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SiMPL method for density-based topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous convergence analysis of a new method for density-based topology optimization: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable. SiMPL provides point-wise bound preserving design updates and faster convergence than other popular first-order topology optimization methods. Due to its strong bound preservation, the method is exceptionally robust, as demonstrated in numerous examples here and in a companion article. Furthermore, it is easy to implement with clear structure and analytical expressions for the updates. Our analysis covers two versions of the method, characterized by the employed line search strategies. We consider a modified Armijo backtracking line search and a Bregman backtracking line search. Regardless of the line search algorithm, SiMPL delivers a strict monotone decrease in the objective function and further intuitive convergence properties, e.g., strong and pointwise convergence of the density variables on the active sets, norm convergence to zero of the increments, and more. In addition, the numerical experiments demonstrate apparent mesh-independent convergence of the algorithm and superior performance over the two most popular first-order methods in topology optimization: OC and MMA.</description>

      <title>Adaptive sampling accelerates the hybrid deviational particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To avoid ineffective collisions between the equilibrium states, the hybrid method with deviational particles (HDP) has been proposed to integrate the Fokker-Planck-Landau system, while leaving a new issue in sampling deviational particles from the high-dimensional source term. In this paper, we present an adaptive sampling (AS) strategy that first adaptively reconstructs a piecewise constant approximation of the source term based on sequential clustering via discrepancy estimation, and then samples deviational particles directly from the resulting adaptive piecewise constant function without rejection. The mixture discrepancy, which can be easily calculated thanks to its explicit analytical expression, is employed as a measure of uniformity instead of the star discrepancy the calculation of which is NP-hard. The resulting method, dubbed the HDP-AS method, runs approximately ten times faster than the HDP method while keeping the same accuracy in the Landau damping, two stream instability, bump on tail and Rosenbluth's test problem.</description>

      <title>Solving Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind via Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

      <title>Alternating Maximization Algorithm for Mismatch Capacity with Oblivious Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19674v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution. Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem. When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches. To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation. This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex. Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup. Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains.</description>

      <title>Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper highlights a relatively unknown link between algorithm design in optimization and control synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the framework of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, yet simpler, and relies on the foundational work by Tannenbaum that introduced and solved the gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna--Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control theory sheds new light into limits of algorithmic performance for such methods, and suggests a new framework where similar computational problems can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal optimization algorithms. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast in a similar manner as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates. The confluence of the fields of optimization algorithms and control provides a frame to tackle questions pertaining to speed, accuracy, distributed computation, and so forth, and to delineate respective limits to performance and tradeoffs in a systematic manner, utilizing the formalism of robust control.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19974v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural and biomedical systems. Simulating such flows requires significant computational resources, making it prudent to devise an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to mitigate this burden. We use a mathematical model that takes a continuum mechanical approach to describe multiphase mixture flows. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and a co-incompressibility condition, while the resulting fluid dynamics necessitate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement technique to accurately capture regions of interest while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR solver asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for all solution variables of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian models. All experiments demonstrate the solver is stable provided the time step size satisfies the imposed CFL condition. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioner, the solver behavior is independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to 10x speedup in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>

      <title>Learning Partial Differential Equations with Deep Parallel Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Solving partial differential equations has shifted the focus of traditional neural network studies from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to generalized functional spaces in research. A novel methodology is to learn an operator as a means of approximating the mapping between outputs. Currently, researchers have proposed a variety of operator architectures. Nevertheless, the majority of these architectures adopt an iterative update architecture, whereby a single operator is learned from the same function space. In practical physical science problems, the numerical solutions of partial differential equations are complex, and a serial single operator is unable to accurately approximate the intricate mapping between input and output. So, We propose a deep parallel operator model (DPNO) for efficiently and accurately solving partial differential equations. DPNO employs convolutional neural networks to extract local features and map data into distinct latent spaces. Designing a parallel block of double Fourier neural operators to solve the iterative error problem. DPNO approximates complex mappings between inputs and outputs by learning multiple operators in different potential spaces in parallel blocks. DPNO achieved the best performance on five of them, with an average improvement of 10.5\%, and ranked second on one dataset.</description>

The linearized method provides an efficient version of the method, drastically reducing computation time. Here we show that the linearized method has some additional advantages.

      <title>Beyond Derivative Pathology of PINNs: Variable Splitting Strategy with Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as effective methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in various problems. Substantial research focuses on the failure modes of PINNs due to their frequent inaccuracies in predictions. However, most are based on the premise that minimizing the loss function to zero causes the network to converge to a solution of the governing PDE. In this study, we prove that PINNs encounter a fundamental issue that the premise is invalid. We also reveal that this issue stems from the inability to regulate the behavior of the derivatives of the predicted solution. Inspired by the \textit{derivative pathology} of PINNs, we propose a \textit{variable splitting} strategy that addresses this issue by parameterizing the gradient of the solution as an auxiliary variable. We demonstrate that using the auxiliary variable eludes derivative pathology by enabling direct monitoring and regulation of the gradient of the predicted solution. Moreover, we prove that the proposed method guarantees convergence to a generalized solution for second-order linear PDEs, indicating its applicability to various problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the use of Gaussian process emulators to approximate the parameter-to-observation map or the negative log-likelihood in Bayesian inverse problems. We prove error bounds on the Hellinger distance between the true posterior distribution and various approximations based on the Gaussian process emulator. Our analysis includes approximations based on the mean of the predictive process, as well as approximations based on the full Gaussian process emulator. Our results show that the Hellinger distance between the true posterior and its approximations can be bounded by moments of the error in the emulator. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of overlapping local views (patches) of a dataset, we consider the problem of finding a rigid alignment of the views that minimizes a $2$-norm based alignment error. In general, the views are noisy and a perfect alignment may not exist. In this work, we characterize the non-degeneracy of an alignment in the noisy setting based on the kernel and positivity of a certain matrix. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm for testing the non-degeneracy of a given alignment. Subsequently, we focus on Riemannian gradient descent for minimizing the alignment error, providing a sufficient condition on an alignment for the algorithm to converge (locally) linearly to it. \revadd{Additionally, we provide an exact recovery and noise stability analysis of the algorithm}. In the case of noiseless views, a perfect alignment exists, resulting in a realization of the points that respects the geometry of the views. Under a mild condition on the views, we show that a non-degenerate perfect alignment \revadd{characterizes the infinitesimally rigidity of a realization, and thus the local rigidity of a generic realization}. By specializing the non-degeneracy conditions to the noiseless case, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the overlapping structure of the views for \revadd{a perfect alignment to be non-degenerate and equivalently, for the resulting realization to be infinitesimally rigid}. Similar results are also derived regarding the uniqueness of a perfect alignment and global rigidity.</description>

      <title>Multiscale estimates for the condition number of non-harmonic Fourier matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the extreme singular values of non-harmonic Fourier matrices. Such a matrix of size $m\times s$ can be written as $\Phi=[ e^{-2\pi i j x_k}]_{j=0,1,\dots,m-1, k=1,2,\dots,s}$ for some set $\mathcal{X}=\{x_k\}_{k=1}^s$. Its condition number controls the stability of inversion, which is of great importance to super-resolution and nonuniform Fourier transforms. Under the assumption $m\geq 6s$ and without any restrictions on $\mathcal{X}$, the main theorems provide explicit lower bounds for the smallest singular value $\sigma_s(\Phi)$ in terms of distances between elements in $\mathcal{X}$. More specifically, distances exceeding an appropriate scale $\tau$ have modest influence on $\sigma_s(\Phi)$, while the product of distances that are less than $\tau$ dominates the behavior of $\sigma_s(\Phi)$. These estimates reveal how the multiscale structure of $\mathcal{X}$ affects the condition number of Fourier matrices. Theoretical and numerical comparisons indicate that the main theorems significantly improve upon classical bounds and recover the same rate for special cases but with relaxed assumptions.</description>

      <title>Doubling the rate -- improved error bounds for orthogonal projection with application to interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence rates for $L_2$ approximation in a Hilbert space $H$ are a central theme in numerical analysis. The present work is inspired by Schaback (Math. Comp., 1999), who showed, in the context of best pointwise approximation for radial basis function interpolation, that the convergence rate for sufficiently smooth functions can be doubled, compared to the best rate for functions in the "native space" $H$. Motivated by this, we obtain a general result for $H$-orthogonal projection onto a finite dimensional subspace of $H$: namely, that any known $L_2$ convergence rate for all functions in $H$ translates into a doubled $L_2$ convergence rate for functions in a smoother normed space $B$, along with a similarly improved error bound in the $H$-norm, provided that $L_2$, $H$ and $B$ are suitably related. As a special case we improve the known $L_2$ and $H$-norm convergence rates for kernel interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, with particular attention to a recent study (Kaarnioja, Kazashi, Kuo, Nobile, Sloan, Numer. Math., 2022) of periodic kernel-based interpolation at lattice points applied to parametric partial differential equations. A second application is to radial basis function interpolation for general conditionally positive definite basis functions, where again the $L_2$ convergence rate is doubled, and the convergence rate in the native space norm is similarly improved, for all functions in a smoother normed space $B$.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation of Operator-Valued Riccati Equations in Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10130v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an abstract theory for the approximation of operator-valued Riccati equations posed on Hilbert spaces. It is demonstrated here that the error of the approximate solution to the operator-valued Riccati equation is bounded above by the approximation error of the governing semigroup, under the assumption of boundedness on the semigroup and compactness on the coefficient operators. One significant outcome of this result is the correct prediction of optimal convergence for finite element approximations of the operator-valued Riccati equations for when the governing semigroup involves parabolic, as well as hyperbolic processes. We derive the abstract theory for the time-dependent and time-independent operator-valued Riccati equations in the first part of this work. In the second part, we derive optimal error estimates for the finite element approximation of the functional gain associated with model weakly damped wave and thermal LQR control systems. These theoretical claims are then corroborated with computational evidence.</description>

      <title>Error Distribution for One-Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation Driven By Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with asymptotic errors, limit theorems for errors between numerical and exact solutions of stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The Euler-Maruyama, higher-order Milstein, and Crank-Nicolson schemes are among the most studied numerical schemes for SDE (fSDE) driven by fBm. Most previous studies of asymptotic errors have derived specific asymptotic errors for these schemes as main theorems or their corollary. Even in the one-dimensional case, the asymptotic error was not determined for the Milstein or the Crank-Nicolson method when the Hurst exponent is less than or equal to $1/3$ with a drift term. We obtained a new evaluation method for convergence and asymptotic errors. This evaluation method improves the conditions under which we can prove convergence of the numerical scheme and obtain the asymptotic error under the same conditions. We have completely determined the asymptotic error of the Milstein method for arbitrary orders. In addition, we have newly determined the asymptotic error of the Crank-Nicolson method for $1/4&lt;H\leq 1/3$.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Riemann curvature to Regge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a generalization of the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds (of dimension two or higher) endowed with a Regge metric. Specifically, while all components of the metric tensor are assumed to be smooth within elements of a triangulation of the manifold, they need not be smooth across element interfaces, where only continuity of the tangential components are assumed. While linear derivatives of the metric can be generalized as Schwartz distributions, similarly generalizing the classical Riemann curvature tensor, a nonlinear second-order derivative of the metric, requires more care. We propose a generalization combining the classical angle defect and jumps of the second fundamental form across element interfaces, and rigorously prove correctness of this generalization. Specifically, if a piecewise smooth metric approximates a globally smooth metric, our generalized Riemann curvature tensor approximates the classical Riemann curvature tensor arising from a globally smooth metric. Moreover, we show that if the metric approximation converges at some rate in a piecewise norm that scales like the $L^2$-norm, then the curvature approximation converges in the $H^{-2}$-norm at the same rate, under additional assumptions. By appropriate contractions of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor, this work also provides generalizations of scalar curvature, the Ricci curvature tensor, and the Einstein tensor in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Density estimation for elliptic PDE with random input by preintegration and quasi-Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with an initial preintegration step to estimate cumulative distribution functions and probability density functions in uncertainty quantification (UQ). The distribution and density functions correspond to a quantity of interest involving the solution to an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with a lognormally distributed coefficient and a normally distributed source term. There is extensive previous work on using QMC to compute expected values in UQ, which have proven very successful in tackling a range of different PDE problems. However, the use of QMC for density estimation applied to UQ problems will be explored here for the first time. Density estimation presents a more difficult challenge compared to computing the expected value due to discontinuities present in the integral formulations of both the distribution and density. Our strategy is to use preintegration to eliminate the discontinuity by integrating out a carefully selected random parameter, so that QMC can be used to approximate the remaining integral. First, we establish regularity results for the PDE quantity of interest that are required for smoothing by preintegration to be effective. We then show that an $N$-point lattice rule can be constructed for the integrands corresponding to the distribution and density, such that after preintegration the QMC error is of order $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\epsilon})$ for arbitrarily small $\epsilon&gt;0$. This is the same rate achieved for computing the expected value of the quantity of interest. Numerical results are presented to reaffirm our theory.</description>

      <title>An Unstructured Mesh Reaction-Drift-Diffusion Master Equation with Reversible Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a convergent reaction-drift-diffusion master equation (CRDDME) to facilitate the study of reaction processes in which spatial transport is influenced by drift due to one-body potential fields within general domain geometries. The generalized CRDDME is obtained through two steps. We first derive an unstructured grid jump process approximation for reversible diffusions, enabling the simulation of drift-diffusion processes where the drift arises due to a conservative field that biases particle motion. Leveraging the Edge-Averaged Finite Element method, our approach preserves detailed balance of drift-diffusion fluxes at equilibrium, and preserves an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for particles undergoing drift-diffusion on the unstructured mesh. We next formulate a spatially-continuous volume reactivity particle-based reaction-drift-diffusion model for reversible reactions of the form $\textrm{A} + \textrm{B} \leftrightarrow \textrm{C}$. A finite volume discretization is used to generate jump process approximations to reaction terms in this model. The discretization is developed to ensure the combined reaction-drift-diffusion jump process approximation is consistent with detailed balance of reaction fluxes holding at equilibrium, along with supporting a discrete version of the continuous equilibrium state. The new CRDDME model represents a continuous-time discrete-space jump process approximation to the underlying volume reactivity model. We demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the new CRDDME through a number of numerical examples, and illustrate its use on an idealized model for membrane protein receptor dynamics in T cell signaling.</description>

      <title>Optimal balanced-norm error estimate of the LDG method for reaction-diffusion problems II: the two-dimensional case with layer-upwind flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method. Typical solutions of this class of 2D problems exhibit boundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause difficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers by using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a ``layer-upwind flux" -- a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine mesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer weakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty terms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG method. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an optimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the usual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed solutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be proved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\ln N)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of degree~$k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result is the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem and is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, our main aim is to investigate the strong convergence for a neutral McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation with super-linear delay driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2, 1)$. After giving uniqueness and existence for the exact solution, we analyze the properties including boundedness of moment and propagation of chaos. Besides, we give the Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme and show that the numerical solution converges strongly to the exact solution. Furthermore, a corresponding numerical example is given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce a new methodology for constructing morphings between shapes that have identical topology. The morphings are obtained by deforming a reference shape, through the resolution of a sequence of linear elasticity equations, onto every target shape. In particular, our approach does not assume any knowledge of a boundary parametrization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constraints can be imposed on specific points, lines and surfaces in the reference domain to ensure alignment with their counterparts in the target domain after morphing. Additionally, we show how the proposed methodology can be integrated in an offline and online paradigm, which is useful in reduced-order modeling involving variable shapes. This framework facilitates the efficient computation of the morphings in various geometric configurations, thus improving the versatility and applicability of the approach. The methodology is illustrated on the regression problem of the drag and lift coefficients of airfoils of non-parameterized variable shapes.</description>

      <title>An AI-aided algorithm for multivariate polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids and the PLG finite difference method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids is fundamental in many scientific and engineering applications, yet it is still an open problem how to construct for a finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{Z}^{\textsf{D}}$ a lattice $\mathcal{T}\subset K$ so that multivariate polynomial interpolation on this lattice is unisolvent. In this work, we solve this open problem of poised lattice generation (PLG) via an interdisciplinary research of approximation theory, abstract algebra, and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we focus on the triangular lattices in approximation theory, study group actions of permutations upon triangular lattices, prove an isomorphism between the group of permutations and that of triangular lattices, and dynamically organize the AI state space of permutations so that a depth-first search of poised lattices has optimal efficiency. Based on this algorithm, we further develop the PLG finite difference method that retains the simplicity of Cartesian grids yet overcomes the disadvantage of legacy finite difference methods in handling irregular geometries. Results of various numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and the simplicity, efficiency, and fourth-order accuracy of the PLG finite difference method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.08917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce subgradient-based Lavrentiev regularisation of the form \begin{equation*} \mathcal{A}(u) + \alpha \partial \mathcal{R}(u) \ni f^\delta \end{equation*} for linear and nonlinear ill-posed problems with monotone operators $\mathcal{A}$ and general regularisation functionals $\mathcal{R}$. In contrast to Tikhonov regularisation, this approach perturbs the equation itself and avoids the use of the adjoint of the derivative of $\mathcal{A}$. It is therefore especially suitable for time-causal problems that only depend on information in the past and allows for real-time computation of regularised solutions. We establish a general well-posedness theory in Banach spaces and prove convergence-rate results with variational source conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application in total-variation denoising in linear Volterra integral operators of the first kind and parameter-identification problems in semilinear parabolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for feasible and approximately optimal solutions of multi-marginal optimal transport beyond discrete measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01633v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm for the computation of multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) problems involving general probability measures that are not necessarily discrete. By developing a relaxation scheme in which marginal constraints are replaced by finitely many linear constraints and by proving a specifically tailored duality result for this setting, we approximate the MMOT problem by a linear semi-infinite optimization problem. Moreover, we are able to recover a feasible and approximately optimal solution of the MMOT problem, and its sub-optimality can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to 0 under mild conditions. The developed relaxation scheme leads to a numerical algorithm which can compute a feasible approximate optimizer of the MMOT problem whose theoretical sub-optimality can be chosen to be arbitrarily small. Besides the approximate optimizer, the algorithm is also able to compute both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value of the MMOT problem. The difference between the computed bounds provides an explicit sub-optimality bound for the computed approximate optimizer. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm in three numerical experiments involving an MMOT problem that stems from fluid dynamics, the Wasserstein barycenter problem, and a large-scale MMOT problem with 100 marginals. We observe that our algorithm is capable of computing high-quality solutions of these MMOT problems and the computed sub-optimality bounds are much less conservative than their theoretical upper bounds in all the experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose and study a stochastic and relaxed preconditioned Douglas--Rachford splitting method to solve saddle-point problems that have separable dual variables. We prove the almost sure convergence of the iteration sequences in Hilbert spaces for a class of convex-concave and nonsmooth saddle-point problems. We also provide the sublinear convergence rate for the ergodic sequence concerning the expectation of the restricted primal-dual gap functions. Numerical experiments show the high efficiency of the proposed stochastic and relaxed preconditioned Douglas--Rachford splitting methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solving a large-scale system of linear equations in a distributed or federated manner by a taskmaster and a set of machines, each possessing a subset of the equations. We provide a comprehensive comparison of two well-known classes of algorithms used to solve this problem: projection-based methods and optimization-based methods. First, we introduce a novel geometric notion of data heterogeneity called angular heterogeneity and discuss its generality. Using this notion, we characterize the optimal convergence rates of the most prominent algorithms from each class, capturing the effects of the number of machines, the number of equations, and that of both cross-machine and local data heterogeneity on these rates. Our analysis establishes the superiority of Accelerated Projected Consensus in realistic scenarios with significant data heterogeneity and offers several insights into how angular heterogeneity affects the efficiency of the methods studied. Additionally, we develop distributed algorithms for the efficient computation of the proposed angular heterogeneity metrics. Our extensive numerical analyses validate and complement our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: The general theory of greedy approximation with respect to arbitrary dictionaries is well developed in the case of real Banach spaces. Recently, some of results proved for the Weak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in the case of real Banach spaces were extended to the case of complex Banach spaces. In this paper we extend some of known in the real case results for other than WCGA greedy algorithms to the case of complex Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of how efficiently functions in the Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{s,q}([0,1]^d)$ and Besov spaces $\mathcal{B}^s_{q,r}([0,1]^d)$ can be approximated by deep ReLU neural networks with width $W$ and depth $L$, when the error is measured in the $L^p([0,1]^d)$ norm. This problem has been studied by several recent works, which obtained the approximation rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ up to logarithmic factors when $p=q=\infty$, and the rate $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2s/d})$ for networks with fixed width when the Sobolev embedding condition $1/q -1/p&lt;s/d$ holds. We generalize these results by showing that the rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ indeed holds under the Sobolev embedding condition. It is known that this rate is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The key tool in our proof is a novel encoding of sparse vectors by using deep ReLU neural networks with varied width and depth, which may be of independent interest.</description>
