      <title>Integrating Protein Dynamics into Structure-Based Drug Design via Full-Atom Stochastic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of proteins, influenced by ligand interactions, is essential for comprehending protein function and progressing drug discovery. Traditional structure-based drug design (SBDD) approaches typically target binding sites with rigid structures, limiting their practical application in drug development. While molecular dynamics simulation can theoretically capture all the biologically relevant conformations, the transition rate is dictated by the intrinsic energy barrier between them, making the sampling process computationally expensive. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose to use generative modeling for SBDD considering conformational changes of protein pockets. We curate a dataset of apo and multiple holo states of protein-ligand complexes, simulated by molecular dynamics, and propose a full-atom flow model (and a stochastic version), named DynamicFlow, that learns to transform apo pockets and noisy ligands into holo pockets and corresponding 3D ligand molecules. Our method uncovers promising ligand molecules and corresponding holo conformations of pockets. Additionally, the resultant holo-like states provide superior inputs for traditional SBDD approaches, playing a significant role in practical drug discovery.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising therapeutic agent due to its ability to silence disease-related genes via RNA interference. While traditional machine learning and early deep learning methods have made progress in predicting siRNA efficacy, there remains significant room for improvement. Advanced deep learning techniques can enhance prediction accuracy, reducing the reliance on extensive wet-lab experiments and accelerating the identification of effective siRNA sequences. This approach also provides deeper insights into the mechanisms of siRNA efficacy, facilitating more targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies.
  Methods: We introduce DeepSilencer, an innovative deep learning model designed to predict siRNA knockdown efficiency. DeepSilencer utilizes advanced neural network architectures to capture the complex features of siRNA sequences. Our key contributions include a specially designed deep learning model, an innovative online data sampling method, and an improved loss function tailored for siRNA prediction. These enhancements collectively boost the model's prediction accuracy and robustness.
  Results: Extensive evaluations on multiple test sets demonstrate that DeepSilencer achieves state-of-the-art performance using only siRNA sequences and basic physicochemical properties. Our model surpasses several other methods and shows superior predictive performance, particularly when incorporating thermodynamic parameters.
  Conclusion: The advancements in data sampling, model design, and loss function significantly enhance the predictive capabilities of DeepSilencer. These improvements underscore its potential to advance RNAi therapeutic design and development, offering a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians.</description>

      <title>A Generalist Cross-Domain Molecular Learning Framework for Structure-Based Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) is a systematic scientific process that develops new drugs by leveraging the detailed physical structure of the target protein. Recent advancements in pre-trained models for biomolecules have demonstrated remarkable success across various biochemical applications, including drug discovery and protein engineering. However, in most approaches, the pre-trained models primarily focus on the characteristics of either small molecules or proteins, without delving into their binding interactions which are essential cross-domain relationships pivotal to SBDD. To fill this gap, we propose a general-purpose foundation model named BIT (an abbreviation for Biomolecular Interaction Transformer), which is capable of encoding a range of biochemical entities, including small molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand complexes, as well as various data formats, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures. Specifically, we introduce Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to handle the biomolecules from diverse biochemical domains and Mixture-of-Structure-Experts (MoSE) to capture positional dependencies in the molecular structures. The proposed mixture-of-experts approach enables BIT to achieve both deep fusion and domain-specific encoding, effectively capturing fine-grained molecular interactions within protein-ligand complexes. Then, we perform cross-domain pre-training on the shared Transformer backbone via several unified self-supervised denoising tasks. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that BIT achieves exceptional performance in downstream tasks, including binding affinity prediction, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular property prediction.</description>

      <title>Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.</description>

      <title>Generative Flows on Synthetic Pathway for Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models in drug discovery have recently gained attention as efficient alternatives to brute-force virtual screening. However, most existing models do not account for synthesizability, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose RxnFlow, which sequentially assembles molecules using predefined molecular building blocks and chemical reaction templates to constrain the synthetic chemical pathway. We then train on this sequential generating process with the objective of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to generate both highly rewarded and diverse molecules. To mitigate the large action space of synthetic pathways in GFlowNets, we implement a novel action space subsampling method. This enables RxnFlow to learn generative flows over extensive action spaces comprising combinations of 1.2 million building blocks and 71 reaction templates without significant computational overhead. Additionally, RxnFlow can employ modified or expanded action spaces for generation without retraining, allowing for the introduction of additional objectives or the incorporation of newly discovered building blocks. We experimentally demonstrate that RxnFlow outperforms existing reaction-based and fragment-based models in pocket-specific optimization across various target pockets. Furthermore, RxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 for pocket-conditional generation, with an average Vina score of -8.85 kcal/mol and 34.8% synthesizability.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Complex Multiplexed DIA Spectra in De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) was introduced to improve sensitivity to cover all peptides in a range rather than only sampling high-intensity peaks as in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry. However, it is not very clear how useful DIA data is for de novo peptide sequencing as the DIA data are marred with coeluted peptides, high noises, and varying data quality. We present a new deep learning method DIANovo, and address each of these difficulties, and improves the previous established system DeepNovo-DIA by from 25% to 81%, averaging 48%, for amino acid recall, and by from 27% to 89%, averaging 57%, for peptide recall, by equipping the model with a deeper understanding of coeluted DIA spectra. This paper also provides criteria about when DIA data could be used for de novo peptide sequencing and when not to by providing a comparison between DDA and DIA, in both de novo and database search mode. We find that while DIA excels with narrow isolation windows on older-generation instruments, it loses its advantage with wider windows. However, with Orbitrap Astral, DIA consistently outperforms DDA due to narrow window mode enabled. We also provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon, emphasizing the critical role of the signal-to-noise profile in the successful application of de novo sequencing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein-specific large language models (Protein LLMs) are revolutionizing protein science by enabling more efficient protein structure prediction, function annotation, and design. While existing surveys focus on specific aspects or applications, this work provides the first comprehensive overview of Protein LLMs, covering their architectures, training datasets, evaluation metrics, and diverse applications. Through a systematic analysis of over 100 articles, we propose a structured taxonomy of state-of-the-art Protein LLMs, analyze how they leverage large-scale protein sequence data for improved accuracy, and explore their potential in advancing protein engineering and biomedical research. Additionally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, positioning Protein LLMs as essential tools for scientific discovery in protein science.

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptides prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>POSERS: Steganography-Driven Molecular Tagging Using Randomized DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses a significant challenge across multiple industries, leading to financial losses and health risks. While DNA-based molecular tagging has emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely on predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as sequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we introduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized Sequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences. POSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions within randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting attempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be adjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We mathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test, successfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our results highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution for secure product authentication.</description>
