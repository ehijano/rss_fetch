      <title>Linear equations and recursively enumerable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study connections between linear equations over various semigroups and recursively enumerable sets of positive integers. We give variants of the universal Diophantine representation of recursively enumerable sets of positive integers established by Matiyasevich. These variants use linear equations with one unkwown instead of polynomial equations with several unknowns. As a corollary we get undecidability results for linear equations over morphism semigoups and over matrix semigroups.</description>

      <title>Separability in B\"uchi Vass and Singly Non-Linear Systems of Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The omega-regular separability problem for B\"uchi VASS coverability languages has recently been shown to be decidable, but with an EXPSPACE lower and a non-primitive recursive upper bound -- the exact complexity remained open. We close this gap and show that the problem is EXPSPACE-complete. A careful analysis of our complexity bounds additionally yields a PSPACE procedure in the case of fixed dimension &gt;= 1, which matches a pre-established lower bound of PSPACE for one dimensional B\"uchi VASS. Our algorithm is a non-deterministic search for a witness whose size, as we show, can be suitably bounded. Part of the procedure is to decide the existence of runs in VASS that satisfy certain non-linear properties. Therefore, a key technical ingredient is to analyze a class of systems of inequalities where one variable may occur in non-linear (polynomial) expressions.
  These so-called singly non-linear systems (SNLS) take the form A(x).y &gt;= b(x), where A(x) and b(x) are a matrix resp. a vector whose entries are polynomials in x, and y ranges over vectors in the rationals. Our main contribution on SNLS is an exponential upper bound on the size of rational solutions to singly non-linear systems. The proof consists of three steps. First, we give a tailor-made quantifier elimination to characterize all real solutions to x. Second, using the root separation theorem about the distance of real roots of polynomials, we show that if a rational solution exists, then there is one with at most polynomially many bits. Third, we insert the solution for x into the SNLS, making it linear and allowing us to invoke standard solution bounds from convex geometry.
  Finally, we combine the results about SNLS with several techniques from the area of VASS to devise an EXPSPACE decision procedure for omega-regular separability of B\"uchi VASS.</description>

      <title>Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward Machines provide an automata-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing complex reward function structure, they enable counterfactual learning updates that have resulted in impressive sample efficiency gains. While Reward Machines have been employed in both tabular and deep RL settings, they have typically relied on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that form the building blocks of the reward function. Such ground-truth interpretations can be elusive in many real-world settings, due in part to partial observability or noisy sensing. In this paper, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that leverage task structure under uncertain interpretation of domain-specific vocabulary. Theoretical analysis exposes pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem, while experimental results show that our algorithms successfully leverage task structure to improve performance under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary. Our results provide a general framework for exploiting Reward Machines in partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds of CFLOBDDs against BDDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are widely used for the representation of Boolean functions. Context-Free-Language Ordered Decision Diagrams (CFLOBDDs) are a plug-compatible replacement for BDDs -- roughly, they are BDDs augmented with a certain form of procedure call. A natural question to ask is, ``For a given Boolean function $f$, what is the relationship between the size of a BDD for $f$ and the size of a CFLOBDD for $f$?'' Sistla et al. established that, in the best case, the CFLOBDD for a function $f$ can be exponentially smaller than any BDD for $f$ (regardless of what variable ordering is used in the BDD); however, they did not give a worst-case bound -- i.e., they left open the question, ``Is there a family of functions $\{ f_i \}$ for which the size of a CFLOBDD for $f_i$ must be substantially larger than a BDD for $f_i$?'' For instance, it could be that there is a family of functions for which the BDDs are exponentially more succinct than any corresponding CFLOBDDs.
  This paper studies such questions, and answers the second question posed above in the negative. In particular, we show that by using the same variable ordering in the CFLOBDD that is used in the BDD, the size of a CFLOBDD for any function $f$ cannot be far worse than the size of the BDD for $f$. The bound that relates their sizes is polynomial: If BDD $B$ for function $f$ is of size $|B|$ and uses variable ordering $\textit{Ord}$, then the size of the CFLOBDD $C$ for $f$ that also uses $\textit{Ord}$ is bounded by $O(|B|^3)$.
  The paper also shows that the bound is tight: there is a family of functions for which $|C|$ grows as $\Omega(|B|^3)$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic automatic complexity of finite strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new complexity measure for finite strings using probabilistic finite-state automata (PFAs), in the same spirit as existing notions employing DFAs and NFAs, and explore its properties. The PFA complexity $A_P(x)$ is the least number of states of a PFA for which $x$ is the most likely string of its length to be accepted. The variant $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ adds a real-valued parameter $\delta$ specifying a required lower bound on the gap in acceptance probabilities between $x$ and other strings. We prove $A_{P,\delta}$ is $\delta$-computable for all $\delta$, relate $A_P$ to the DFA and NFA complexities, and obtain a complete classification of binary strings with $A_P=2$. Finally, we discuss several other variations on $A_P$ with a view to obtaining additional desirable properties.</description>

      <title>The CFG Complexity of Singleton Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form. We take the number of rules in G to be the size of G. We also assume all CFGs are in Chomsky normal form.
  We consider the question of, given a string w of length n, what is the smallest CFG such that L(G)={w}? We show the following:
  1) For all w, |w|=n, there is a CFG of size with O(n/log n) rules, such that L(G)={w}.
  2) There exists a string w, |w|=n, such that every CFG G with L(G)={w} is of size Omega(n/log n). We give two proofs of: one nonconstructive, the other constructive.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Geometries of Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce geometric consideration into the theory of formal languages. We aim to shed light on our understanding of global patterns that occur on infinite strings. We utilise methods of geometric group theory. Our emphasis is on large scale geometries. Two infinite strings have the same large scale geometry if there are colour preserving bi-Lipschitz maps with distortions between the strings. Call these maps quasi-isometries. Introduction of large scale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the partial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large scale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of global patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and infinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related to understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The third question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings accepted by computational models, e.g. B\"uchi automata. We provide an algorithm that describes large scale geometries of strings accepted by B\"uchi automata. This links large scale geometries with automata theory. The fourth question studies the complexity of the quasi-isometry problem. We show the problem is $\Sigma_3^0$-complete thus providing a bridge with computability theory. Finally, the fifth question asks to build algebraic structures that are invariants of large scale geometries. We invoke asymptotic cones, a key concept in geometric group theory, defined via model-theoretic notion of ultra-product. Partly, we study asymptotic cones of algorithmically random strings thus connecting the topic with algorithmic randomness.</description>

      <title>Idempotent cellular automata and their natural order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for idempotent cellular automata (CA), we study CA that act almost as the identity unless they read a fixed pattern $p$. We show that constant and symmetrical patterns always produce idempotent CA, and we characterize the quasi-constant patterns that produce idempotent CA. Our results are valid for CA over an arbitrary group $G$. Moreover, we study the semigroup theoretic natural partial order defined on idempotent CA. If $G$ is infinite, we prove that there is an infinite independent set of idempotent CA, and if $G$ has an element of infinite order, we prove that there is an infinite increasing chain of idempotent CA.</description>

      <title>The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.</description>
