      <title>Geometric Theory of Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contribute to the mathematical theory of the design of low temperature Ising machines, a type of experimental probabilistic computing device implementing the Ising model. Encoding the output of a function in the ground state of a physical system allows efficient and distributed computation, but the design of the energy function is a difficult puzzle. We introduce a diagrammatic device that allows us to visualize the decision boundaries for Ising circuits. It is then used to prove two results: (1) Ising circuits are a generalization of 1-NN classifiers with a certain special structure, and (2) Elimination of local minima in the energy landscape can be formulated as a linear programming problem.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Quantum Code Transpilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems. Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution. Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical-Processing of Constant-Depth Time Evolution Circuits in Control Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large Full Duplex MIMO for Simultaneous Downlink Communications and Monostatic Sensing at Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-band Full Duplex (FD) technology is lately gaining attention as an enabler for the emerging paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), which envisions seamless integration of sensing mechanisms for unconnected entities into next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we present an FD Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with extremely large antenna arrays at its transceiver module, which is optimized, considering two emerging analog beamforming architectures, for simultaneous DownLink (DL) communications and monostatic-type sensing intended at the sub-THz frequencies, with the latter operation relying on received reflections of the transmitted information-bearing signals. A novel optimization framework for the joint design of the analog and digital transmit beamforming, analog receive combining, and the digital canceler for the self-interference signal is devised with the objective to maximize the achievable DL rate, while meeting a predefined threshold for the position error bound for the unknown three-dimensional parameters of a passive target. Capitalizing on the distinctive features of the beamforming architectures with fully-connected networks of phase shifters and partially-connected arrays of metamaterials, two ISAC designs are presented. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of both proposed designs over state-of-the-art schemes, highlighting the role of various system parameters in the trade-off between the communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.</description>
