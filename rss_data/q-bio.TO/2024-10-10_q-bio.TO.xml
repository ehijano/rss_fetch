      <title>Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.</description>

      <title>Curved edges in the vertex model increase tissue fluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vertex Model for epithelia models the apical surface of the tissue by a tiling, with polygons representing cells and edges representing cell-cell junctions. The mechanics are described by an energy governed by deviations from a target area and perimeter for each cell. It has been shown that the target perimeter, p0, governs a solid-to-fluid phase transition: when the target perimeter is low there is an energy barrier to rearrangement, and when it is high cells may rearrange for free and the tissue can flow like a liquid. One simplification often made is modelling junctions using straight edges. However, the Young-Laplace equation states that interfaces should be circular arcs, with the curvature being equal to the pressure difference between the neighbouring cells divided by the interfacial tension. Here, we investigate how including curved edges alters the mechanical properties of the vertex model and equilibrium shape of individual cells. Importantly, we show how curved edges shift the solid-to-fluid transition point, from $p0 = 3.81$ to $p0 = 3.73$, allowing tissues to fluidise sooner than in the traditional model with straight edges.</description>
