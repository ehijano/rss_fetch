      <title>The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools have grown in higher education and research, there have been increasing calls for transparency and granularity around the use and attribution of the use of these tools. Thus far, this need has been met via the recommended inclusion of a note, with little to no guidance on what the note itself should include. This has been identified as a problem to the use of AI in academic and research contexts. This article introduces The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework, a standard, comprehensive, and detailed framework meant to inform the development and writing of GenAI disclosure for education and research.</description>

      <title>The OpenCitations Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the OpenCitations Index, a collection of open citation data maintained by OpenCitations, an independent, not-for-profit infrastructure organisation for open scholarship dedicated to publishing open bibliographic and citation data using Semantic Web and Linked Open Data technologies. The collection involves citation data harvested from multiple sources. To address the possibility of different sources providing citation data for bibliographic entities represented with different identifiers, therefore potentially representing same citation, a deduplication mechanism has been implemented. This ensures that citations integrated into OpenCitations Index are accurately identified uniquely, even when different identifiers are used. This mechanism follows a specific workflow, which encompasses a preprocessing of the original source data, a management of the provided bibliographic metadata, and the generation of new citation data to be integrated into the OpenCitations Index. The process relies on another data collection: OpenCitations Meta, and on the use of a new globally persistent identifier, namely OMID (OpenCitations Meta Identifier). As of July 2024, OpenCitations Index stores over 2 billion unique citation links, harvest from Crossref, the National Institute of Heath Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC), DataCite, OpenAIRE, and the Japan Link Center (JaLC). OpenCitations Index can be systematically accessed and queried through several services, including SPARQL endpoint, REST APIs, and web interfaces. Additionally, dataset dumps are available for free download and reuse (under CC0 waiver) in various formats (CSV, N-Triples, and Scholix), including provenance and change tracking information.</description>

      <title>pathfinder: A Semantic Framework for Literature Review and Knowledge Discovery in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of astronomical literature poses significant challenges for researchers navigating and synthesizing general insights or even domain-specific knowledge. We present Pathfinder, a machine learning framework designed to enable literature review and knowledge discovery in astronomy, focusing on semantic searching with natural language instead of syntactic searches with keywords. Utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and a corpus of 350,000 peer-reviewed papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), Pathfinder offers an innovative approach to scientific inquiry and literature exploration. Our framework couples advanced retrieval techniques with LLM-based synthesis to search astronomical literature by semantic context as a complement to currently existing methods that use keywords or citation graphs. It addresses complexities of jargon, named entities, and temporal aspects through time-based and citation-based weighting schemes. We demonstrate the tool's versatility through case studies, showcasing its application in various research scenarios. The system's performance is evaluated using custom benchmarks, including single-paper and multi-paper tasks. Beyond literature review, Pathfinder offers unique capabilities for reformatting answers in ways that are accessible to various audiences (e.g. in a different language or as simplified text), visualizing research landscapes, and tracking the impact of observatories and methodologies. This tool represents a significant advancement in applying AI to astronomical research, aiding researchers at all career stages in navigating modern astronomy literature.</description>

      <title>Quantifying gendered citation imbalance in computer science conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of citations received by papers often exhibits imbalances in terms of author attributes such as country of affiliation and gender. While recent studies have quantified citation imbalance in terms of the authors' gender in journal papers, the computer science discipline, where researchers frequently present their work at conferences, may exhibit unique patterns in gendered citation imbalance. Additionally, understanding how network properties in citations influence citation imbalances remains challenging due to a lack of suitable reference models. In this paper, we develop a family of reference models for citation networks and investigate gender imbalance in citations between papers published in computer science conferences. By deploying these reference models, we found that homophily in citations is strongly associated with gendered citation imbalance in computer science, whereas heterogeneity in the number of citations received per paper has a relatively minor association with it. Furthermore, we found that the gendered citation imbalance is most pronounced in papers published in the highest-ranked conferences, is present across different subfields, and extends to citation-based rankings of papers. Our study provides a framework for investigating associations between network properties and citation imbalances, aiming to enhance our understanding of the structure and dynamics of citations between research publications.</description>

      <title>PUREsuggest: Citation-based Literature Search and Visual Exploration with Keyword-controlled Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citations allow quickly identifying related research. If multiple publications are selected as seeds, specific suggestions for related literature can be made based on the number of incoming and outgoing citation links to this selection. Interactively adding recommended publications to the selection refines the next suggestion and incrementally builds a relevant collection of publications. Following this approach, the paper presents a search and foraging approach, PUREsuggest, which combines citation-based suggestions with augmented visualizations of the citation network. The focus and novelty of the approach is, first, the transparency of how the rankings are explained visually and, second, that the process can be steered through user-defined keywords, which reflect topics of interests. The system can be used to build new literature collections, to update and assess existing ones, as well as to use the collected literature for identifying relevant experts in the field. We evaluated the recommendation approach through simulated sessions and performed a user study investigating search strategies and usage patterns supported by the interface.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge Graph Approach for Exploratory Search in Research Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, research institutions have grown increasingly and consequently also their research output. This poses a significant challenge for researchers seeking to understand the research landscape of an institution. The process of exploring the research landscape of institutions has a vague information need, no precise goal, and is open-ended. Current applications are not designed to fulfill the requirements for exploratory search in research institutions. In this paper, we analyze exploratory search in research institutions and propose a knowledge graph-based approach to enhance this process.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. The trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the value of meta-research for research communities and the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>
