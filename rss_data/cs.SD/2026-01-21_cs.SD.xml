      <title>Embryonic Exposure to VPA Influences Chick Vocalisations: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In young animals like poultry chicks (Gallus gallus), vocalisations convey information about affective and behavioural states. Traditional approaches to vocalisation analysis, relying on manual annotation and predefined categories, introduce biases, limit scalability, and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal repertoires. We introduce a computational framework for the automated detection, acoustic feature extraction, and unsupervised learning of chick vocalisations. Applying this framework to a dataset of newly hatched chicks, we identified two primary vocal clusters. We then tested our computational framework on an independent dataset of chicks exposed during embryonic development to vehicle or Valproic Acid (VPA), a compound that disrupts neural development and is linked to autistic-like symptoms. Clustering analysis on the experimental dataset confirmed two primary vocal clusters and revealed systematic differences between groups. VPA-exposed chicks showed an altered repertoire, with a relative increase in softer calls. VPA differentially affected call clusters, modulating temporal, frequency, and energy domain features. Overall, VPA-exposed chicks produced vocalisations with shorter duration, reduced pitch variability, and modified energy profiles, with the strongest alterations observed in louder calls. This study provides a computational framework for analysing animal vocalisations, advancing knowledge of early-life communication in typical and atypical vocal development.</description>

      <title>Do Neural Codecs Generalize? A Controlled Study Across Unseen Languages and Non-Speech Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates three crucial yet underexplored aspects of the generalization capabilities of neural audio codecs (NACs): (i) whether NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, (ii) whether speech-only pre-trained NACs can effectively generalize to non-speech applications such as environmental sounds, music, and animal vocalizations, and (iii) whether incorporating non-speech data during pre-training can improve performance on both speech and non-speech tasks. Existing studies typically rely on off-the-shelf NACs for comparison, which limits insight due to variations in implementation. In this work, we train NACs from scratch using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data to enable fair comparisons. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics. Our results show that NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs exhibit degraded performance on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks.</description>

      <title>Song Aesthetics Evaluation with Multi-Stem Attention and Hierarchical Uncertainty Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding music content, necessitating automated song aesthetics evaluation. However, existing studies largely focus on speech, audio or singing quality, leaving song aesthetics underexplored. Moreover, conventional approaches often predict a precise Mean Opinion Score (MOS) value directly, which struggles to capture the nuances of human perception in song aesthetics evaluation. This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score. We evaluated on two datasets of full-length songs: SongEval dataset (AI-generated) and an internal aesthetics dataset (human-created), and compared with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the proposed method achieves stronger performance for multi-dimensional song aesthetics evaluation.</description>

      <title>Confidence-based Filtering for Speech Dataset Curation with Generative Speech Enhancement Using Discrete Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement (GSE) models show great promise in producing high-quality clean speech from noisy inputs, enabling applications such as curating noisy text-to-speech (TTS) datasets into high-quality ones. However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models.</description>

      <title>ParaMETA: Towards Learning Disentangled Paralinguistic Speaking Styles Representations from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning representative embeddings for different types of speaking styles, such as emotion, age, and gender, is critical for both recognition tasks (e.g., cognitive computing and human-computer interaction) and generative tasks (e.g., style-controllable speech generation). In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Similarity Network for Correlating Musical Structure to Military Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music perception, a multi-sensory process based on the synesthesia effect, is an essential component of music aesthetic education. Understanding music structure helps both perception and aesthetic education. Music structure incorporates a range of information, the coordination of which forms the melody, just as different military actions cooperate to produce a military strategy. However, there are a few ways for assessing music perception from the perspectives of system operation and information management. In this paper, we explore the similarities between music structure and military strategy while creating the Music Clips Correlation Network (MCCN) based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The inspiration comes from the comparison between a concert conductor's musical score and a military war commander's sand table exercise. Specifically, we create MCCNs for various kinds of war movie soundtracks, then relate military tactics (Sun Tzu's Art of War, etc.) and political institutions to military operations networks. Our primary findings suggest a few similarities, implying that music perception and aesthetic education can be approached from a military strategy and management perspective through this interdisciplinary research. Similarly, we can discover similarities between the art of military scheming and the art of musical structure based on network analysis in order to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between technology and art.</description>

      <title>A Unified Neural Codec Language Model for Selective Editable Text to Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural codec language models achieve impressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) by fully imitating the acoustic characteristics of a short speech prompt, including timbre, prosody, and paralinguistic information. However, such holistic imitation limits their ability to isolate and control individual attributes. In this paper, we present a unified codec language model SpeechEdit that extends zero-shot TTS with a selective control mechanism. By default, SpeechEdit reproduces the complete acoustic profile inferred from the speech prompt, but it selectively overrides only the attributes specified by explicit control instructions. To enable controllable modeling, SpeechEdit is trained on our newly constructed LibriEdit dataset, which provides delta (difference-aware) training pairs derived from LibriHeavy. Experimental results show that our approach maintains naturalness and robustness while offering flexible and localized control over desired attributes. Audio samples are available at https://speech-editing.github.io/speech-editing/.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing the Arabic Audio Space with Data Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) enable unified speech understanding and generation, yet their adaptation to linguistically complex, dialect-rich settings remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-task instruction tuning for an Arabic-centric audio LLM, covering a hierarchy of generative tasks (ASR, speech summarization) and discriminative tasks (dialect and emotion identification). To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments.</description>

      <title>SmoothCLAP: Soft-Target Enhanced Contrastive Language\--Audio Pretraining for Affective Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambiguity of human emotions poses several challenges for machine learning models, as they often overlap and lack clear delineating boundaries. Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has emerged as a key technique for generalisable emotion recognition. However, as conventional CLAP enforces a strict one-to-one alignment between paired audio-text samples, it overlooks intra-modal similarity and treats all non-matching pairs as equally negative. This conflicts with the fuzzy boundaries between different emotions. To address this limitation, we propose SmoothCLAP, which introduces softened targets derived from intra-modal similarity and paralinguistic features. By combining these softened targets with conventional contrastive supervision, SmoothCLAP learns embeddings that respect graded emotional relationships, while retaining the same inference pipeline as CLAP. Experiments on eight affective computing tasks across English and German demonstrate that SmoothCLAP is consistently achieving superior performance. Our results highlight that leveraging soft supervision is a promising strategy for building emotion-aware audio-text models.</description>

      <title>SSVD-O: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Structured SVD for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a scalable approach for adapting large speech foundation models to new domains. While methods such as LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants reduce adaptation costs, they typically allocate parameters uniformly across model subspaces, which limits their efficiency and scalability in speech applications. Building on our prior work, this paper introduces SSVD-Outer (SSVD-O), an extension of the structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning method. SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation. We conduct the first systematic analysis of parameter budget allocation across model subspaces in PEFT for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and investigate the trade-off between learning and forgetting under constrained resources. SSVD-O is benchmarked against LoRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SSVD on domain-shifted ASR tasks, including child speech and regional accents, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B within the ESPnet framework. Experimental results show that SSVD-O consistently narrows the performance gap to full fine-tuning while improving generalization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Toward Faithful Explanations in Acoustic Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is essential for user trust in real-world anomaly detection applications. However, deep learning models, despite their strong performance, often lack transparency. In this work, we study the interpretability of autoencoder-based models for audio anomaly detection, by comparing a standard autoencoder (AE) with a mask autoencoder (MAE) in terms of detection performance and interpretability. We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies. To assess the relevance of the regions highlighted by the explanation method, we propose a perturbation-based faithfulness metric that replaces them with their reconstructions to simulate normal input. Our findings, based on experiments in a real industrial scenario, highlight the importance of incorporating interpretability into anomaly detection pipelines and show that masked training improves explanation quality without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>SoundPlot: An Open-Source Framework for Birdsong Acoustic Analysis and Neural Synthesis with Interactive 3D Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SoundPlot, an open-source framework for analyzing avian vocalizations through acoustic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and neural audio synthesis. The system transforms audio signals into a multi-dimensional acoustic feature space, enabling real-time visualization of temporal dynamics in 3D using web-based interactive graphics. Our framework implements a complete analysis-synthesis pipeline that extracts spectral features (centroid, bandwidth, contrast), pitch contours via probabilistic YIN (pYIN), and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), mapping them to a unified timbre space for visualization. Audio reconstruction employs the Griffin-Lim phase estimation algorithm applied to mel spectrograms. The accompanying Three.js-based interface provides dual-viewport visualization comparing original and synthesized audio trajectories with independent playback controls. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through comprehensive waveform analysis, spectrogram comparisons, and feature space evaluation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Quantitative evaluation shows mel spectrogram correlation scores exceeding 0.92, indicating high-fidelity preservation of perceptual acoustic structure. SoundPlot is released under the MIT License to facilitate research in bioacoustics, audio signal processing, and computational ethology.</description>

      <title>UNMIXX: Untangling Highly Correlated Singing Voices Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UNMIXX, a novel framework for multiple singing voices separation (MSVS). While related to speech separation, MSVS faces unique challenges: data scarcity and the highly correlated nature of singing voices mixture. To address these issues, we propose UNMIXX with three key components: (1) musically informed mixing strategy to construct highly correlated, music-like mixtures, (2) cross-source attention that drives representations of two singers apart via reverse attention, and (3) magnitude penalty loss penalizing erroneously assigned interfering energy. UNMIXX not only addresses data scarcity by simulating realistic training data, but also excels at separating highly correlated mixtures through cross-source interactions at both the architectural and loss levels. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UNMIXX greatly enhances performance, with SDRi gains exceeding 2.2 dB over prior work.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning for Game Music Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, neural network-based models, including transformers, struggle to generate memorable and readily comprehensible music from unified and repetitive musical material due to a lack of understanding of musical structure. Consequently, these models are rarely employed by the games industry. It is hypothesised by many scholars that the modelling of musical structure may inform models at a higher level, thereby enhancing the quality of music generation. The aim of this study is to explore the performance of supervised learning methods in the task of structural segmentation, which is the initial step in music structure modelling. An audio game music dataset with 309 structural annotations was created to train the proposed method, which combines convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods with fewer training resources.</description>

Abstract: The Lombard effect plays a key role in natural communication, particularly in noisy environments or when addressing hearing-impaired listeners. We present a controllable text-to-speech (TTS) system capable of synthesizing Lombard speech for any speaker without requiring explicit Lombard data during training. Our approach leverages style embeddings learned from a large, prosodically diverse dataset and analyzes their correlation with Lombard attributes using principal component analysis (PCA). By shifting the relevant PCA components, we manipulate the style embeddings and incorporate them into our TTS model to generate speech at desired Lombard levels. Evaluations demonstrate that our method preserves naturalness and speaker identity, enhances intelligibility under noise, and provides fine-grained control over prosody, offering a robust solution for controllable Lombard TTS for any speaker.</description>

      <title>The Achilles' Heel of Angular Margins: A Chebyshev Polynomial Fix for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular margin losses, such as AAM-Softmax, have become the de facto in speaker and face verification. Their success hinges on directly manipulating the angle between features and class prototypes. However, this manipulation relies on the arccos function to recover the angle, introducing a significant yet overlooked source of training instability. The derivative of arccos explodes at its boundaries, causing gradient peaks during optimisation. Furthermore, the formulation fails to generate a sufficiently sharp gradient for hard-to-classify examples. We address these issues by proposing ChebyAAM, a loss that replaces the arccos operation with its Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This substitution eliminates gradient explosion and applies a stronger corrective signal to hard examples, leading to more effective optimisation. Experiments on three benchmarks (VoxCeleb, SITW, and CN-Celeb) demonstrate that our method resolves the instability and consistently improves performance. Our work suggests that approximating angular operations, rather than calculating them explicitly, offers a more robust path for designing future metric learning losses.

      <title>Event Classification by Physics-informed Inpainting for Distributed Multichannel Acoustic Sensor with Partially Degraded Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel acoustic sensing (DMAS) enables large-scale sound event classification (SEC), but performance drops when many channels are degraded and when sensor layouts at test time differ from training layouts. We propose a learning-free, physics-informed inpainting frontend based on reverse time migration (RTM). In this approach, observed multichannel spectrograms are first back-propagated on a 3D grid using an analytic Green's function to form a scene-consistent image, and then forward-projected to reconstruct inpainted signals before log-mel feature extraction and Transformer-based classification. We evaluate the method on ESC-50 with 50 sensors and three layouts (circular, linear, right-angle), where per-channel SNRs are sampled from -30 to 0 dB. Compared with an AST baseline, scaling-sparsemax channel selection, and channel-swap augmentation, the proposed RTM frontend achieves the best or competitive accuracy across all layouts, improving accuracy by 13.1 points on the right-angle layout (from 9.7% to 22.8%). Correlation analyses show that spatial weights align more strongly with SNR than with channel--source distance, and that higher SNR--weight correlation corresponds to higher SEC accuracy. These results demonstrate that a reconstruct-then-project, physics-based preprocessing effectively complements learning-only methods for DMAS under layout-open configurations and severe channel degradation.</description>

      <title>LongSpeech: A Scalable Benchmark for Transcription, Translation and Understanding in Long Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-language models have demonstrated remarkable success on short, segment-level speech tasks. However, real-world applications such as meeting transcription, spoken document understanding, and conversational analysis require robust models capable of processing and reasoning over long-form audio. In this work, we present LongSpeech, a large-scale and scalable benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and advance the capabilities of speech models on long-duration audio. LongSpeech comprises over 100,000 speech segments, each approximately 10 minutes long, with rich annotations for ASR, speech translation, summarization, language detection, speaker counting, content separation, and question answering. We introduce a reproducible pipeline for constructing long-form speech benchmarks from diverse sources, enabling future extensions. Our initial experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance gaps, with models often specializing in one task at the expense of others and struggling with higher-level reasoning. These findings underscore the challenging nature of our benchmark. Our benchmark will be made publicly available to the research community.</description>

      <title>Fusion Segment Transformer: Bi-Directional Attention Guided Fusion Network for AI-Generated Music Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of generative AI technology, anyone can now easily create and deploy AI-generated music, which has heightened the need for technical solutions to address copyright and ownership issues. While existing works mainly focused on short-audio, the challenge of full-audio detection, which requires modeling long-term structure and context, remains insufficiently explored. To address this, we propose an improved version of the Segment Transformer, termed the Fusion Segment Transformer. As in our previous work, we extract content embeddings from short music segments using diverse feature extractors. Furthermore, we enhance the architecture for full-audio AI-generated music detection by introducing a Gated Fusion Layer that effectively integrates content and structural information, enabling the capture of long-term context. Experiments on the SONICS and AIME datasets show that our approach outperforms the previous model and recent baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in AI-generated music detection.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Lightweight Network for Ship-Radiated Sound Classification on Embedded Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents ShuffleFAC, a lightweight acoustic model for ship-radiated sound classification in resource-constrained maritime monitoring systems. ShuffleFAC integrates Frequency-Aware convolution into an efficiency-oriented backbone using separable convolution, point-wise group convolution, and channel shuffle, enabling frequency-sensitive feature extraction with low computational cost. Experiments on the DeepShip dataset show that ShuffleFAC achieves competitive performance with substantially reduced complexity. In particular, ShuffleFAC ($\gamma=16$) attains a macro F1-score of 71.45 $\pm$ 1.18% using 39K parameters and 3.06M MACs, and achieves an inference latency of 6.05 $\pm$ 0.95ms on a Raspberry Pi. Compared with MicroNet0, it improves macro F1-score by 1.82 % while reducing model size by 9.7x and latency by 2.5x. These results indicate that ShuffleFAC is suitable for real-time embedded UATR.</description>

      <title>DistilMOS: Layer-Wise Self-Distillation For Self-Supervised Learning Model-Based MOS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of self-supervised learning (SSL), fine-tuning pretrained SSL models for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, during fine-tuning, these SSL-based MOS prediction models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the pretrained knowledge and tend to overfit the training set, resulting in poor generalization performance. In this study, we propose DistilMOS, a novel method that learns to predict not only MOS but also token IDs obtained by clustering the hidden representations of each layer in the pretrained SSL model. These layer-wise token targets serve as self-distillation signals that enables the MOS prediction model to extract rich internal knowledge from SSL models, enhancing both prediction accuracy and generalization capability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard SSL-based MOS prediction models on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13704v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.</description>

      <title>GOMPSNR: Reflourish the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Metric for Audio Generation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of audio generation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has long served as an objective metric for evaluating audio quality. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that SNR and its variants are not always highly correlated with human perception, prompting us to raise the questions: Why does SNR fail in measuring audio quality? And how to improve its reliability as an objective metric? In this paper, we identify the inadequate measurement of phase distance as a pivotal factor and propose to reformulate SNR with specially designed phase-distance terms, yielding an improved metric named GOMPSNR. We further extend the newly proposed formulation to derive two novel categories of loss function, corresponding to magnitude-guided phase refinement and joint magnitude-phase optimization, respectively. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted for an optimal combination of different loss functions. Experimental results on advanced neural vocoders demonstrate that our proposed GOMPSNR exhibits more reliable error measurement than SNR. Meanwhile, our proposed loss functions yield substantial improvements in model performance, and our wellchosen combination of different loss functions further optimizes the overall model capability.</description>

      <title>Emotion and Acoustics Should Agree: Cross-Level Inconsistency Analysis for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) aims to detect spoof speech from bonafide speech. Most prior studies assume that stronger correlations within or across acoustic and emotional features imply authenticity, and thus focus on enhancing or measuring such correlations. However, existing methods often treat acoustic and emotional features in isolation or rely on correlation metrics, which overlook subtle desynchronization between them and smooth out abrupt discontinuities. To address these issues, we propose EAI-ADD, which treats cross level emotion acoustic inconsistency as the primary detection signal. We first project emotional and acoustic representations into a comparable space. Then we progressively integrate frame level and utterance level emotion features with acoustic features to capture cross level emotion acoustic inconsistencies across different temporal granularities. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019LA and 2021LA datasets demonstrate that the proposed EAI-ADD outperforms baselines, providing a more effective solution for audio anti spoofing detection.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Negation Modeling in Joint Audio-Text Models for Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint audio-text models are widely used for music retrieval, yet they struggle with semantic phenomena such as negation. Negation is fundamental for distinguishing the absence (or presence) of musical elements (e.g., "with vocals" vs. "without vocals"), but current systems fail to represent this reliably. In this work, we investigate and mitigate this limitation by training CLAP models from scratch on the Million Song Dataset with LP-MusicCaps-MSD captions. We introduce negation through text augmentation and a dissimilarity-based contrastive loss, designed to explicitly separate original and negated captions in the joint embedding space. To evaluate progress, we propose two protocols that frame negation modeling as retrieval and binary classification tasks. Experiments demonstrate that both methods, individually and combined, improve negation handling while largely preserving retrieval performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods like TCAV require clean, well-separated positive and negative examples for each concept. Existing music datasets lack this structure: tags are sparse, noisy, or ill-defined. We introduce ConceptCaps, a dataset of 23k music-caption-audio triplets with explicit labels from a 200-attribute taxonomy. Our pipeline separates semantic modeling from text generation: a VAE learns plausible attribute co-occurrence patterns, a fine-tuned LLM converts attribute lists into professional descriptions, and MusicGen synthesizes corresponding audio. This separation improves coherence and controllability over end-to-end approaches. We validate the dataset through audio-text alignment (CLAP), linguistic quality metrics (BERTScore, MAUVE), and TCAV analysis confirming that concept probes recover musically meaningful patterns. Dataset and code are available online.</description>

      <title>Transformer Architectures for Respiratory Sound Analysis and Multimodal Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory sound analysis is a crucial tool for screening asthma and other pulmonary pathologies, yet traditional auscultation remains subjective and experience-dependent. Our prior research established a CNN baseline using DenseNet201, which demonstrated high sensitivity in classifying respiratory sounds. In this work, we (i) adapt the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for respiratory sound analysis and (ii) evaluate a multimodal Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates spectrograms with structured patient metadata.
  AST is initialized from publicly available weights and fine-tuned on a medical dataset containing hundreds of recordings per diagnosis. The VLM experiment uses a compact Moondream-type model that processes spectrogram images alongside a structured text prompt (sex, age, recording site) to output a JSON-formatted diagnosis. Results indicate that AST achieves approximately 97% accuracy with an F1-score around 97% and ROC AUC of 0.98 for asthma detection, significantly outperforming both the internal CNN baseline and typical external benchmarks. The VLM reaches 86-87% accuracy, performing comparably to the CNN baseline while demonstrating the capability to integrate clinical context into the inference process. These results confirm the effectiveness of self-attention for acoustic screening and highlight the potential of multimodal architectures for holistic diagnostic tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged in symbolic music reasoning, yet existing benchmarks emphasize isolated knowledge or atomic analyses rather than the integrative compositional reasoning needed to connect musical structures. To address this, we present the Compositional Symbolic Music Reasoning Benchmark (CSyMR-Bench), a curated multiple-choice dataset of 126 questions derived from expert forums and professional examinations. Each item involves combining several atomic analyses to arrive at the final answer. Furthermore, we introduce a tool-augmented agent framework that leverages symbolic music analysis tools from the music21 library to address the challenges posed by CSyMR-Bench. Experiments validate that CSyMR-Bench poses a non-trivial challenge across both community-sourced and exam-style questions, while our tool-augmented agent consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving 5-7% absolute accuracy gains.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Self-Supervised Detection of Fundamental Frequency and Accurate Probability of Voicing in Monophonic Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental frequency (F 0) and voicing estimation is essential for neural synthesis, yet many pitch extractors depend on large labeled corpora and degrade under realistic recording artifacts. We propose a lightweight, fully self-supervised framework for joint F 0 estimation and voicing inference, designed for rapid single-instrument training from limited audio. Using transposition-equivariant learning on CQT features, we introduce an EM-style iterative reweighting scheme that uses Shift Cross-Entropy (SCE) consistency as a reliability signal to suppress uninformative noisy/unvoiced frames. The resulting weights provide confidence scores that enable pseudo-labeling for a separate lightweight voicing classifier without manual annotations. Trained on MedleyDB and evaluated on MDB-stem-synth ground truth, our method achieves competitive cross-corpus performance (RPA 95.84, RCA 96.24) and demonstrates cross-instrument generalization.</description>

      <title>The Third VoicePrivacy Challenge: Preserving Emotional Expressiveness and Linguistic Content in Voice Anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results and analyses from the third VoicePrivacy Challenge held in 2024, which focuses on advancing voice anonymization technologies. The task was to develop a voice anonymization system for speech data that conceals a speaker's voice identity while preserving linguistic content and emotional state. We provide a systematic overview of the challenge framework, including detailed descriptions of the anonymization task and datasets used for both system development and evaluation. We outline the attack model and objective evaluation metrics for assessing privacy protection (concealing speaker voice identity) and utility (content and emotional state preservation). We describe six baseline anonymization systems and summarize the innovative approaches developed by challenge participants. Finally, we provide key insights and observations to guide the design of future VoicePrivacy challenges and identify promising directions for voice anonymization research.</description>

      <title>MuseAgent-1: Interactive Grounded Multimodal Understanding of Music Scores and Performance Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their ability to understand and interact with music remains limited. Music understanding requires grounded reasoning over symbolic scores and expressive performance audio, which general-purpose MLLMs often fail to handle due to insufficient perceptual grounding. We introduce MuseAgent, a music-centric multimodal agent that augments language models with structured symbolic representations derived from sheet music images and performance audio. By integrating optical music recognition and automatic music transcription modules, MuseAgent enables multi-step reasoning and interaction over fine-grained musical content. To systematically evaluate music understanding capabilities, we further propose MuseBench, a benchmark covering music theory reasoning, score interpretation, and performance-level analysis across text, image, and audio modalities. Experiments show that existing MLLMs perform poorly on these tasks, while MuseAgent achieves substantial improvements, highlighting the importance of structured multimodal grounding for interactive music understanding.</description>

      <title>Learning Audio-Visual Embeddings with Inferred Latent Interaction Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust audio-visual embeddings requires bringing genuinely related audio and visual signals together while filtering out incidental co-occurrences - background noise, unrelated elements, or unannotated events. Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled "train" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because "motorcycle" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., "Train (visual)" -&gt; "Motorcycle (audio)") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence.</description>

      <title>A Survey on 30+ Years of Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Singing Assessment and Singing Information Processing have evolved over the past three decades to support singing pedagogy, performance analysis, and vocal training. While the first approach objectively evaluates a singer's performance through computational metrics ranging from real-time visual feedback and acoustical biofeedback to sophisticated pitch tracking and spectral analysis, the latter method compares a predictor vocal signal with a target reference to capture nuanced data embedded in the singing voice. Notable advancements include the development of interactive systems that have significantly improved real-time visual feedback, and the integration of machine learning and deep neural network architectures that enhance the precision of vocal signal processing. This survey critically examines the literature to map the historical evolution of these technologies, while identifying and discussing key gaps. The analysis reveals persistent challenges, such as the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, difficulties in reliably separating vocal signals from various noise sources, and the underutilization of advanced digital signal processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for capturing artistic expressivity. By detailing these limitations and the corresponding technological advances, this review demonstrates how addressing these issues can bridge the gap between objective computational assessments and subjective human-like evaluations of singing performance, ultimately enhancing both the technical accuracy and pedagogical relevance of automated singing evaluation systems.</description>

      <title>VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative. Recent text-to-music models let creators generate music from text prompts, but our formative study (N=8) shows creators struggle to construct diverse prompts, quickly review and compare tracks, and understand their impact on the video. We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.</description>

      <title>Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12245v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description>

      <title>AQUA-Bench: Beyond Finding Answers to Knowing When There Are None in Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12345v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement models face significant performance degradation in extremely noisy environments. While prior work has shown that complementary bone-conducted speech can guide enhancement, effective integration of this noise-immune modality remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel multimodal speech enhancement framework that integrates bone-conduction sensors with air-conducted microphones using a conditional diffusion model. Our proposed model significantly outperforms previously established multimodal techniques and a powerful diffusion-based single-modal baseline across a wide range of acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>Purification Before Fusion: Toward Mask-Free Speech Enhancement for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) typically improves recognition accuracy in noisy environments by integrating noise-immune visual cues with audio signals. Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Overdetermined Independent Vector Analysis Based on Bilinear Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online blind source separation is essential for both speech communication and human-machine interaction. Among existing approaches, overdetermined independent vector analysis (OverIVA) delivers strong performance by exploiting the statistical independence of source signals and the orthogonality between source and noise subspaces. However, when applied to large microphone arrays, the number of parameters grows rapidly, which can degrade online estimation accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose decomposing each long separation filter into a bilinear form of two shorter filters, thereby reducing the number of parameters. Because the two filters are closely coupled, we design an alternating iterative projection algorithm to update them in turn. Simulation results show that, with far fewer parameters, the proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>SLAP: Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining with Variable-Duration Audio and Multi-Objective Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has achieved notable success in learning semantically rich audio representations and is widely adopted for various audio-related tasks. However, current CLAP models face several key limitations. First, they are typically trained on relatively small datasets, often comprising a few million audio samples. Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations. The proposed SLAP model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval and zero-shot audio classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) provides a principled framework for estimating posterior distributions over model parameters, enabling explicit modeling of weight uncertainty during optimization. By capturing this uncertainty, VI improves the reliability of predictions, yielding better calibrated outputs. In this work, we investigate the benefits of VI for challenging multimodal understanding and reasoning by applying the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON), a recent VI optimizer, to fine-tuning a multimodal large language model on audio question answering tasks. Our results show that VI not only enhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves calibration, reducing the model's overconfidence. These advances further support risk-sensitive applications such as selective prediction, where reliable confidence estimates are crucial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker anonymization aims to conceal a speaker's identity, without considering the linguistic content. In this study, we reveal a weakness of Librispeech, the dataset that is commonly used to evaluate anonymizers: the books read by the Librispeech speakers are so distinct, that speakers can be identified by their vocabularies. Even perfect anonymizers cannot prevent this identity leakage. The EdAcc dataset is better in this regard: only a few speakers can be identified through their vocabularies, encouraging the attacker to look elsewhere for the identities of the anonymized speakers. EdAcc also comprises spontaneous speech and more diverse speakers, complementing Librispeech and giving more insights into how anonymizers work.</description>

      <title>Context and Transcripts Improve Detection of Deepfake Audios of Public Figures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans use context to assess the veracity of information. However, current audio deepfake detectors only analyze the audio file without considering either context or transcripts. We create and analyze a Journalist-provided Deepfake Dataset (JDD) of 255 public deepfakes which were primarily contributed by over 70 journalists since early 2024. We also generate a synthetic audio dataset (SYN) of dead public figures and propose a novel Context-based Audio Deepfake Detector (CADD) architecture. In addition, we evaluate performance on two large-scale datasets: ITW and P$^2$V. We show that sufficient context and/or the transcript can significantly improve the efficacy of audio deepfake detectors. Performance (measured via F1 score, AUC, and EER) of multiple baseline audio deepfake detectors and traditional classifiers can be improved by 5%-37.58% in F1-score, 3.77%-42.79% in AUC, and 6.17%-47.83% in EER. We additionally show that CADD, via its use of context and/or transcripts, is more robust to 5 adversarial evasion strategies, limiting performance degradation to an average of just -0.71% across all experiments. Code, models, and datasets are available at our project page: https://sites.northwestern.edu/nsail/cadd-context-based-audio-deepfake-detection (access restricted during review).</description>

      <title>Motion-to-Response Content Generation via Multi-Agent AI System with Real-Time Safety Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that generates response-oriented media content in real time based on audio-derived emotional signals. Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment. The modular architecture enables interpretability and extensibility, making it applicable to child-adjacent media, therapeutic applications, and emotionally responsive smart devices.</description>

      <title>Habibi: Laying the Open-Source Foundation of Unified-Dialectal Arabic Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A notable gap persists in speech synthesis research and development for Arabic dialects, particularly from a unified modeling perspective. Despite its high practical value, the inherent linguistic complexity of Arabic dialects, further compounded by a lack of standardized data, benchmarks, and evaluation guidelines, steers researchers toward safer ground. To bridge this divide, we present Habibi, a suite of specialized and unified text-to-speech models that harnesses existing open-source ASR corpora to support a wide range of high- to low-resource Arabic dialects through linguistically-informed curriculum learning. Our approach outperforms the leading commercial service in generation quality, while maintaining extensibility through effective in-context learning, without requiring text diacritization. We are committed to open-sourcing the model, along with creating the first systematic benchmark for multi-dialect Arabic speech synthesis. Furthermore, by identifying the key challenges in and establishing evaluation standards for the process, we aim to provide a solid groundwork for subsequent research.

      <title>PRiSM: Benchmarking Phone Realization in Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phone recognition (PR) serves as the atomic interface for language-agnostic modeling for cross-lingual speech processing and phonetic analysis. Despite prolonged efforts in developing PR systems, current evaluations only measure surface-level transcription accuracy. We introduce PRiSM, the first open-source benchmark designed to expose blind spots in phonetic perception through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of PR systems. PRiSM standardizes transcription-based evaluation and assesses downstream utility in clinical, educational, and multilingual settings with transcription and representation probes. We find that diverse language exposure during training is key to PR performance, encoder-CTC models are the most stable, and specialized PR models still outperform Large Audio Language Models. PRiSM releases code, recipes, and datasets to move the field toward multilingual speech models with robust phonetic ability: https://github.com/changelinglab/prism.</description>

      <title>XMAD-Bench: Cross-Domain Multilingual Audio Deepfake Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested "in the wild". Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.</description>

      <title>GLAP: General contrastive audio-text pretraining across domains and languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally, GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks, while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and music understanding is evaluated across four languages.

      <title>How Does Instrumental Music Help SingFake Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.</description>

      <title>From Hype to Insight: Rethinking Large Language Model Integration in Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in self-supervised encoders have improved Visual Speech Recognition (VSR). Recent approaches integrating these encoders with LLM decoders improves transcription accuracy; however, it remains unclear whether these gains stem from visual understanding or stronger language modeling. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM decoders by freezing or selectively updating the visual encoder, scaling decoder size, comparing adaptation strategies and architectures, and varying training data across LRS2, LRS3, and their combination. Evaluation on LRS2, LRS3, and WildVSR shows that scaling and adaptation yield limited improvements, while combining datasets enhances generalization. Semantic analysis reveals that gains arise primarily from lexical rather than semantic processing. Our Llama-2-13B model trained on the combined set achieves 24.7% WER on LRS3 and 47.0% on WildVSR, establishing SOTA among models trained without additional supervision. Our findings indicate LLM decoders refine contextual reasoning rather than visual features, emphasizing the need for stronger visual encoders to drive meaningful progress.</description>

      <title>A Stage-Wise Learning Strategy with Fixed Anchors for Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning robust speaker representations under noisy conditions presents significant challenges, which requires careful handling of both discriminative and noise-invariant properties. In this work, we proposed an anchor-based stage-wise learning strategy for robust speaker representation learning. Specifically, our approach begins by training a base model to establish discriminative speaker boundaries, and then extract anchor embeddings from this model as stable references. Finally, a copy of the base model is fine-tuned on noisy inputs, regularized by enforcing proximity to their corresponding fixed anchor embeddings to preserve speaker identity under distortion. Experimental results suggest that this strategy offers advantages over conventional joint optimization, particularly in maintaining discrimination while improving noise robustness. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across various noise conditions, potentially due to its ability to handle boundary stabilization and variation suppression separately.</description>

      <title>SpikCommander: A High-performance Spiking Transformer with Multi-view Learning for Efficient Speech Command Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising path toward energy-efficient speech command recognition (SCR) by leveraging their event-driven processing paradigm. However, existing SNN-based SCR methods often struggle to capture rich temporal dependencies and contextual information from speech due to limited temporal modeling and binary spike-based representations. To address these challenges, we first introduce the multi-view spiking temporal-aware self-attention (MSTASA) module, which combines effective spiking temporal-aware attention with a multi-view learning framework to model complementary temporal dependencies in speech commands. Building on MSTASA, we further propose SpikCommander, a fully spike-driven transformer architecture that integrates MSTASA with a spiking contextual refinement channel MLP (SCR-MLP) to jointly enhance temporal context modeling and channel-wise feature integration. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), and the Google Speech Commands V2 (GSC). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikCommander consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN approaches with fewer parameters under comparable time steps, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for robust speech command recognition.</description>

      <title>MMEDIT: A Unified Framework for Multi-Type Audio Editing via Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided audio editing aims to modify specific acoustic events while strictly preserving non-target content. Despite recent progress, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited. Training-free methods often suffer from signal degradation caused by diffusion inversion, while training-based methods, although achieving higher generation quality, are severely constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired data and task formulations that cover only a narrow subset of editing operations. In addition, standard architectures typically decouple text and audio processing, limiting the ability to align instructions with specific acoustic contexts.
  To address these challenges, we propose MMEdit, an audio-language-model-driven framework for unified audio editing. We systematically extend task definitions to cover a comprehensive range of editing operations, including addition, replacement, removal, reordering, and attribute modification. Furthermore, we design a scalable data synthesis pipeline to construct large-scale paired datasets with fine-grained event-level annotations. To capture complex editing semantics, we integrate a Qwen2-Audio encoder with an MMDiT-based generator, enabling precise cross-modal alignment and localized editing.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing localization accuracy, robust instruction following, and high fidelity in non-edited regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ESDD2: Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio recorded in real-world environments often contains a mixture of foreground speech and background environmental sounds. With rapid advances in text-to-speech, voice conversion, and other generation models, either component can now be modified independently. Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2026 (ICME 2026).</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to infer human affect by jointly modeling audio and visual cues; however, existing approaches often struggle with temporal misalignment, weakly discriminative feature representations, and suboptimal fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AVT-CA, an Audio-Video Transformer architecture with cross attention for robust emotion recognition. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical video feature representation that combines channel attention, spatial attention, and local feature extraction to emphasize emotionally salient regions while suppressing irrelevant information. These refined visual features are integrated with audio representations through an intermediate transformer-based fusion mechanism that captures interlinked temporal dependencies across modalities. Furthermore, a cross-attention module selectively reinforces mutually consistent audio-visual cues, enabling effective feature selection and noise-aware fusion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS, and CREMA-D, demonstrate that AVT-CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and F1-score.

      <title>Emotional Dimension Control in Language Model-Based Text-to-Speech: Spanning a Broad Spectrum of Human Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems sturggle to capture the full spectrum of human emotions due to the inherent complexity of emotional expressions and the limited coverage of existing emotion labels. To address this, we propose a language model-based TTS framework that synthesizes speech across a broad range of emotional styles. Our approach enables flexible user control along three continuous dimensions - pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD). To enable this, we train an emotional dimension predictor that maps categorical emotion labels in speech datasets into the PAD space, grounded in established psychological research. Importantly, while the emotional dimension predictor leverages categorical labels, the TTS framework itself does not require explict emotion labels during training. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework effectively generates more expressive emotional styles and enhances both naturalness and diversity compared to baselines.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating young children's language is challenging for automatic speech recognizers due to high-pitched voices, prolonged sounds, and limited data. We introduce K-Function, a framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription with objective, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven scoring. Its core, Kids-Weighted Finite State Transducer (K-WFST), merges an acoustic phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity model to capture child-specific speech errors while remaining fully interpretable. K-WFST achieves a 1.39 % phoneme error rate on MyST and 8.61 % on Multitudes-an absolute improvement of 10.47 % and 7.06 % over a greedy-search decoder. These high-quality transcripts are used by an LLM to grade verbal skills, developmental milestones, reading, and comprehension, with results that align closely with human evaluators. Our findings show that precise phoneme recognition is essential for creating an effective assessment framework, enabling scalable language screening for children.</description>

      <title>TurnGuide: Enhancing Meaningful Full Duplex Spoken Interactions via Dynamic Turn-Level Text-Speech Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational turn-taking such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions, but their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. Although interleaved text-speech generation could mitigate this degradation, integrating discrete text tokens into continuous double-channel audio streams could disrupt the precise time alignment required for fluid interaction. To address this, we propose TurnGuide, a novel text-speech interleaved generation approach for e2e FD-SLMs that dynamically segments assistant speech into dialogue turns and interleaves turn-level text and speech generation. This approach allows FD-SLMs to integrate the semantic intelligence of LLMs without compromising the natural acoustic flow. Extensive experiments show that TurnGuide not only significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs to produce semantically meaningful, coherent speech but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various turn-taking events. Demos are available at https://dreamtheater123.github.io/TurnGuide-Demo/. Code will be available at https://github.com/dreamtheater123/TurnGuide.</description>

      <title>DAIEN-TTS: Disentangled Audio Infilling for Environment-Aware Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents DAIEN-TTS, a zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework that enables ENvironment-aware synthesis through Disentangled Audio Infilling. By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual classifier-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.</description>

      <title>SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.</description>

      <title>Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/Fun-Audio-Chat .</description>
