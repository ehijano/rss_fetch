      <title>Modular Multirotary Joints SPS Concept-Challenges and Design Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a major space based energy infrastructure in response to the challenge of climate change, space solar power SSP has attracted extensive international attention for more than 55 years. Recently, various SSP concepts have been proposed, aiming to efficiently harvest gigawatts of solar power over Earth geostationary orbit and transmit it to the Earth wirelessly. Based on the multirotary joints solar power satellite MR SPS concept proposed in 2014, this article presents an updated modular MR SPS concept, together with the challenges and design considerations. The primary objective is to address the challenges associated with long distance dc electric power transmission and exceptionally high precision microwave power transmission. The MMR SPS employs multiple modules, each further including a solar subpanel and an antenna subpanel. The solar subpanel and antenna subpanel in each module are connected with each other via conductive rotary joints with a much shorter distance compared with that in the MR SPS concept. As a result, lower voltage in electric power transmission is allowed, which significantly reduces the complexity of the system and increases its reliability. Retroreflective beamforming is employed to ensure the accurate steering of the microwave power beam to the ground receiving aperture. For the first time, this article analyzes and validates the performance of using retroreflective beamforming to compensate for antenna position deviations through a numerical calculation model that includes near field effects. Additionally, this article outlines the transportation and assembly methods, along with the considerations of the full life cycle cost for an MMR SPS.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for the slow flow of an unstable mechanical system coupled to a nonlinear energy sink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper one first shows that the slow flow of a mechanical system with one unstable mode coupled to a Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES) can be reduced, in the neighborhood of a fold point of its critical manifold, to a normal form of the dynamic saddle-node bifurcation. This allows us to then obtain a scaling law for the slow flow dynamics and to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction of the mitigation limit of the NES previously obtained as part of a zeroth-order approximation. For that purpose, the governing equations of the coupled system are first simplified using a reduced-order model for the primary structure by keeping only its unstable modal coordinates. The slow flow is then derived by means of the complexification-averaging method and, by the presence of a small perturbation parameter related to the mass ratio between the NES and the primary structure, it appears as a fast-slow system. The center manifold theorem is finally used to obtain the reduced form of the slow flow which is solved analytically leading to the scaling law. The latter reveals a nontrivial dependence with respect to the small perturbation parameter of the slow flow dynamics near the fold point, involving the fractional exponents 1/3 and 2/3. Finally, a new theoretical prediction of the mitigation limit is deduced from the scaling law. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified and validated numerically using an aeroelastic aircraft wing model coupled to one NES.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>

      <title>X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) spectroscopy is an experimental technique for element-specific spin dynamics in the GHz regime and has been utilized to study spintronic materials. The XFMR signal is usually obtained by detecting X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) emitted from a sample substrate. Here, we report the development of an XFMR spectrometer that is designed to place a photodetector for XEOL detection outside an ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This configuration allows for the easy replacement of detectors, such as photodiodes, CCD cameras, and spectrometers, depending on the experimental requirements. We demonstrated the measurement of XEOL spectra from MgO using a visible light spectrometer as well as the detection of XFMR signals originating from the spin precession of a permalloy (Ni80Fe20) thin film using a photodiode detector. The XFMR spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector expands possibilities for advanced measurements such as XFMR microscopy.</description>

      <title>Network localization governs social contagion dynamics with macro-level reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of ideas, behaviors, and technologies generally depends on feedback mechanisms operating across multiple scales. Previous studies have extensively examined pairwise transmission and local reinforcement. However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption. These findings challenge the conventional belief that stronger local connectivity uniformly promotes contagion.</description>

      <title>The inverse parametric problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to calculate the frequency components of a pump waveform driving a parametric oscillator, which realizes a desired frequency mixing or scattering between modes. The method is validated by numerical analysis and we study its sensitivity to added Gaussian noise. A series of experiments apply the method and demonstrate its ability to realize complex scattering processes involving many modes at microwave frequencies, including non-reciprocal mode circulation. We also present an approximate method to dynamically control mode scattering, capable of rapidly routing signals between modes in a prescribed manner. These methods are useful tools for encoding and manipulating continuous variable quantum information with multi-modal Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates by a three-step growth protocol without ex-situ processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fabricate (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates with a total thickness of ~1 um grown on GaN templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. In a three-step process, we change growth conditions from N-rich to metal-rich in order to sequentially form a roughened GaN layer, relaxed (In,Ga)N nanostructures, and a coalesced, smooth (In,Ga)N layer. Samples are analyzed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, as well as photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared to a reference layer grown directly on GaN, the pseudo-substrate exhibits a higher In content (~0.3), strain relaxation degree (~80%), narrower photoluminescence linewidth, and larger area fraction of bright regions in cathodoluminescence maps, showing the benefits of the three-step growth protocol. This straightforward approach does not necessitate any ex-situ processing and could enable the scalable fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates for high-efficiency red-emitting (In,Ga)N devices.</description>

      <title>From Complex Magnetic Ground States to Magnetocaloric Effects: A Review of Rare Earth R$_2$In Intermetallic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: R2In (R = rare earth) intermetallics exhibit unusual magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, driven by subtle electronic effects, lattice distortions, and spin-lattice coupling. Most of these binary compounds adopt the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure at room temperature, with Eu2In and Yb2In stabilizing in the orthorhombic Co2Si-type lattice. Lighter lanthanide compounds Eu2In, Nd2In, and Pr2In undergo first-order magnetic transitions with negligible hysteresis and minimal lattice volume change and exhibit giant cryogenic magnetocaloric effects, while heavy lanthanide R2In compounds including Gd2In show second-order transitions with moderate magnetocaloric effect. No lanthanide-based R2In compound exhibits symmetry-breaking structural transition, while Y2In transforms from hexagonal to orthorhombic structure near 250 K. Secondary low-temperature transitions, including spin reorientation or antiferromagnetic ordering, further enrich the magnetic phase landscape in these compounds. Integrating theoretical descriptors such as charge-induced strain and electronic structure provides predictive insight into phase stability and magnetocaloric performance, guiding the design of rare-earth intermetallics with tunable magnetic properties for cryogenic applications</description>

      <title>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-defects in green-emitting nitride LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.</description>

      <title>Optical modulation of Gate-Induced Electron Trapping via Persistent Photoconductivity in STO/AlOx Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-Speed NV Ensemble Magnetic Field Imaging via Laser Raster Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a technique that uses an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to image magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization -- analogous to pulsed ODMR -- while the microwave field continuously drives the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microwire with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and, with our diamond, achieves $\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-level per-pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness &lt;=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p&lt;1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p&gt;1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.</description>
