      <title>Coding-Based Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptosystem for Non-Uniform Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce for non-uniform messages a novel hybrid universal network coding cryptosystem (NU-HUNCC) in the finite blocklength regime that provides Post-Quantum (PQ) security at high communication rates. Recently, hybrid cryptosystems offered PQ security by premixing the data using secure linear coding schemes and encrypting only a small portion of it. The data is assumed to be uniformly distributed, an assumption that is often challenging to enforce. Standard fixed-length lossless source coding and compression schemes guarantee a uniform output in normalized divergence. Yet, this is not sufficient to guarantee security. We consider an efficient compression scheme uniform in non-normalized variational distance for the proposed hybrid cryptosystem, that by utilizing a uniform sub-linear shared seed, guarantees PQ security. Specifically, for the proposed PQ cryptosystem, first, we provide an end-to-end practical coding scheme, NU-HUNCC, for non-uniform messages. Second, we show that NU-HUNCC is information-theoretic individually secured (IS) against an eavesdropper with access to any subset of the links and provide a converse proof against such an eavesdropper. Third, we introduce a modified security definition, individual semantic security under a chosen ciphertext attack (ISS-CCA1), and show that against an all-observing eavesdropper, NU-HUNCC satisfies its conditions. Finally, we provide an analysis of NU-HUNCC's high data rate, low computational complexity, and the negligibility of the shared seed size.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Meets RIS: Random Matrix Analysis and Two-Timescale Design for Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FASs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provides significant flexibility in optimizing channel conditions by jointly adjusting the positions of fluid antennas and the phase shifts of RISs. However, it is challenging to acquire the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) for both fluid antennas and RISs, while frequent adjustment of antenna positions and phase shifts will significantly increase the system complexity. To tackle this issue, this paper investigates the two-timescale design for FAS-RIS multi-user systems with linear precoding, where only the linear precoder design requires instantaneous CSI of the end-to-end channel, while the FAS and RIS optimization relies on statistical CSI. The main challenge comes from the complex structure of channel and inverse operations in linear precoding, such as regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and zero-forcing (ZF). Leveraging on random matrix theory (RMT), we first investigate the fundamental limits of FAS-RIS systems with RZF/ZF precoding by deriving the ergodic sum rate (ESR). This result is utilized to determine the minimum number of activated antennas to achieve a given ESR. Based on the evaluation result, we propose an algorithm to jointly optimize the antenna selection, regularization factor of RZF, and phase shifts at the RIS. Numerical results validate the accuracy of performance evaluation and demonstrate that the performance gain brought by joint FAS and RIS design is more pronounced with a larger number of users.</description>

      <title>Wireless Hallucination in Generative AI-enabled Communications: Concepts, Issues, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is driving the intelligence of wireless communications. Due to data limitations, random generation, and dynamic environments, GenAI may generate channel information or optimization strategies that violate physical laws or deviate from actual real-world requirements. We refer to this phenomenon as wireless hallucination, which results in invalid channel information, spectrum wastage, and low communication reliability but remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article provides a comprehensive concept of wireless hallucinations in GenAI-driven communications, focusing on hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental, analyze its causes based on the GenAI workflow, and propose mitigation solutions at the data, model, and post-generation levels. Then, we systematically examines representative hallucination scenarios in GenAI-enabled communications and their corresponding solutions. Finally, we propose a novel integrated mitigation solution for GenAI-based channel estimation. At the data level, we establish a channel estimation hallucination dataset and employ generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data augmentation. Additionally, we incorporate attention mechanisms and large language models (LLMs) to enhance both training and inference performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid solutions reduce the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 0.19, effectively reducing wireless hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Robust Adaptive Beamforming Based on Spatial Sampling with Virtual Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) based on interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix reconstruction can experience serious performance degradation in the presence of look direction and array geometry mismatches, particularly when the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large. In this work, we present a RAB technique to address covariance matrix reconstruction problems. The proposed method involves IPNC matrix reconstruction using a low-complexity spatial sampling process (LCSSP) and employs a virtual received array vector. In particular, we devise a power spectrum sampling strategy based on a projection matrix computed in a higher dimension. A key feature of the proposed LCSSP technique is to avoid reconstruction of the IPNC matrix by integrating over the angular sector of the interference-plus-noise region. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCSSP method against existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Large class of many-to-one mappings over quadratic extension of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-to-one mappings and permutation polynomials over finite fields have important applications in cryptography and coding theory. In this paper, we study the many-to-one property of a large class of polynomials such as $f(x) = h(a x^q + b x + c) + u x^q + v x$, where $h(x) \in \mathbb{F}_{q^2}[x]$ and $a$, $b$, $c$, $u$, $v \in \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Using a commutative diagram satisfied by $f(x)$ and trace functions over finite fields, we reduce the problem whether $f(x)$ is a many-to-one mapping on $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ to another problem whether an associated polynomial $g(x)$ is a many-to-one mapping on the subfield $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. In particular, when $h(x) = x^{r}$ and $r$ satisfies certain conditions, we reduce $g(x)$ to polynomials of small degree or linearized polynomials. Then by employing the many-to-one properties of these low degree or linearized polynomials on $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we derive a series of explicit characterization for $f(x)$ to be many-to-one on $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. On the other hand, for all $1$-to-$1$ mappings obtained in this paper, we determine the inverses of these permutation polynomials. Moreover, we also explicitly construct involutions from $2$-to-$1$ mappings of this form. Our findings generalize and unify many results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory: Fundamentals, Paradigm Shifts, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the emerging research direction of electromagnetic information theory (EIT), which aims to integrate traditional Shannon-based methodologies with physical consistency, particularly the electromagnetic properties of communication channels. We propose an EIT-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) paradigm that enhances conventional spatially-discrete MIMO models by incorporating the concepts of electromagnetic (EM) precoding and EM combining. This approach aims to improve the modeling of next-generation systems while remaining consistent with Shannon's theoretical foundations. We explore typical EIT applications, such as densely spaced MIMO, near-field communications, and tri-polarized antennas, and analyze their channel characteristics through theoretical simulations and measured datasets. The paper also discusses critical research challenges and opportunities for EIT applications from an industrial perspective, emphasizing the field's potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>On many-to-one property of generalized cyclotomic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized cyclotomic mappings over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ are those mappings which induce monomial functions on all cosets of an index $\ell$ subgroup $C_0$ of the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$. Previous research has focused on the one-to-one property, the functional graphs, and their applications in constructing linear codes and bent functions. In this paper, we devote to study the many-to-one property of these mappings. We completely characterize many-to-one generalized cyclotomic mappings for $1 \le \ell \le 3$. Moreover, we completely classify $2$-to-$1$ generalized cyclotomic mappings for any divisor $\ell$ of $q-1$. In addition, we construct several classes of many-to-one binomials and trinomials of the form $x^r h(x^{q-1})$ on $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $h(x)^{q-1}$ induces monomial functions on the cosets of a subgroup of $U_{q+1}$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Integrated Sensing and Communications for Multi-Target Detection and Tracking in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system where distributed access points (APs) perform integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) tasks, enabling simultaneous user communication and target detection/tracking. A unified framework and signal model are developed for the detection of potential targets and tracking of previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Pull-Based Query Scheduling for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Weighted Codebook Scheme for RIS-Assisted Point-to-Point MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels by intelligently regulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements. Recently, various codebook schemes have been utilized to optimize the reflection coefficients (RCs); however, the selection of the optimal codeword is usually obtained by evaluating a metric of interest. In this letter, we propose a novel weighted design on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to obtain the optimal RCs for RIS-assisted point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol where we configure the RIS RCs using the DFT codebook to obtain a set of observations through the uplink training process. Secondly, based on these observed samples, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to optimize the weights in an iterative manner, which could result in a higher channel capacity for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of different codeword configuration orders on system performance and design an efficient codeword configuration method based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Optimization for Cross Subcarrier Precoder Design with Channel Smoothing in Massive MIMO-OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a cross subcarrier precoder design (CSPD) for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The aim is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) performance while considering the smoothness of the frequency domain effective channel. To quantify the smoothness of the effective channel, we introduce a delay indicator function to measure the large delay components of the effective channel. An optimization problem is then formulated to balance the WSR performance and the delay indicator function. By appropriately selecting the weight factors in the objective function and the parameters in the delay indicator function, the delay spread of the effective channel can be reduced, thereby enhancing the smoothness of the effective channel. To solve the optimization problem, we apply the symplectic optimization, which achieves faster convergence compared to the gradient descent methods. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfying WSR performance while maintaining the smoothness of the effective channel.</description>

      <title>Power Allocation for Coordinated Multi-Point Aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a coordinated multiple point (CoMP)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that supports multiple users and targets. Multiple base stations (BSs) employ a coordinated power allocation strategy to serve their associated single-antenna communication users (CUs) while utilizing the echo signals for joint radar target (RT) detection. The probability of detection (PoD) of the CoMP-ISAC system is then proposed for assessing the sensing performance. To maximize the sum rate while ensuring the PoD for each RT and adhering to the total transmit power budget across all BSs, we introduce an efficient power allocation strategy. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating that the proposed power allocation scheme effectively enhances the sum rate while satisfying the sensing requirements.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</description>

      <title>Interference-Aware Super-Constellation Design for NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA.

      <title>On the Minimum Distances of Finite-Length Lifted Product Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and recently proposed families of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code are prime candidates for advanced QEC hardware architectures and implementations. This paper focuses on the finite-length QLDPC code design criteria, specifically aimed at constructing degenerate quasi-cyclic symmetric lifted-product (LP-QLDPC) codes. We describe the necessary conditions such that the designed LP-QLDPC codes are guaranteed to have a minimum distance strictly greater than the minimum weight stabilizer generators, ensuring superior error correction performance on quantum channels. The focus is on LP-QLDPC codes built from quasi-cyclic base codes belonging to the class of type-I protographs, and the necessary constraints are efficiently expressed in terms of the row and column indices of the base code. Specifically, we characterize the combinatorial constraints on the classical quasi-cyclic base matrices that guarantee construction of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes. Minimal examples and illustrations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the code construction approach. The row and column partition constraints derived in the paper simplify the design of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes and can be incorporated into existing classical and quantum code design approaches.</description>

      <title>Biased Federated Learning under Wireless Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. Existing wireless FL works primarily adopt two communication strategies: (1) over-the-air (OTA) computation, which exploits wireless signal superposition for simultaneous gradient aggregation, and (2) digital communication, which allocates orthogonal resources for gradient uploads. Prior works on both schemes typically assume \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) to enforce zero-bias updates or permit uncontrolled bias, resulting in suboptimal performance and high-variance model updates in \emph{heterogeneous} environments, where devices with poor channel conditions slow down convergence. This paper addresses FL over heterogeneous wireless networks by proposing novel OTA and digital FL updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias, thereby reducing variance in FL updates. We analyze their convergence under a unified framework and derive an upper bound on the model ``optimality error", which explicitly quantifies the effect of bias and variance in terms of design parameters. Next, to optimize this trade-off, we study a non-convex optimization problem and develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework to jointly optimize the design parameters. We perform extensive numerical evaluations with several related design variants and state-of-the-art OTA and digital FL schemes. Our results confirm that minimizing the bias-variance trade-off while allowing a structured bias provides better FL convergence performance than existing schemes.</description>

      <title>On Statistical Estimation of Edge-Reinforced Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforced random walks (RRWs), including vertex-reinforced random walks (VRRWs) and edge-reinforced random walks (ERRWs), model random walks where the transition probabilities evolve based on prior visitation history~\cite{mgr, fmk, tarres, volkov}. These models have found applications in various areas, such as network representation learning~\cite{xzzs}, reinforced PageRank~\cite{gly}, and modeling animal behaviors~\cite{smouse}, among others. However, statistical estimation of the parameters governing RRWs remains underexplored. This work focuses on estimating the initial edge weights of ERRWs using observed trajectory data. Leveraging the connections between an ERRW and a random walk in a random environment (RWRE)~\cite{mr, mr2}, as given by the so-called "magic formula", we propose an estimator based on the generalized method of moments. To analyze the sample complexity of our estimator, we exploit the hyperbolic Gaussian structure embedded in the random environment to bound the fluctuations of the underlying random edge conductances.</description>

      <title>Sphere Precoding for Robust Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-field communication with large antenna arrays promises significant beamforming and multiplexing gains. These communication links, however, are very sensitive to user mobility as any small change in the user position may suddenly drop the signal power. This leads to critical challenges for the robustness of these near-field communication systems. In this paper, we propose \textit{sphere precoding}, which is a robust precoding design to address user mobility in near-field communications. To gain insights into the spatial correlation of near-field channels, we extend the one-ring channel model to what we call one-sphere channel model and derive the channel covariance considering user mobility. Based on the one-sphere channel model, a robust precoding design problem is defined to optimize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) satisfaction probability among mobile users. By utilizing the eigen structure of channel covariance, we further design a relaxed convex problem to approximate the solution of the original non-convex problem. The low-complexity solution effectively shapes a sphere that maintains the signal power for the target user and also nulls its interference within spheres around the other users. Simulation results highlight the efficacy of the proposed solution in achieving robust precoding yet high achievable rates in near-field communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate distortion dimension describes the theoretical limit of lossy data compression methods as the distortion bound goes to zero. It was originally introduced in the context of information theory, and recently it was discovered that it has an intimate connection to Gromov's theory of mean dimension of dynamical systems. This paper studies the behavior of rate distortion dimension of $\mathbb{R}^d$-actions under ergodic decomposition. Our main theorems provide natural convexity and concavity of upper and lower rate distortion dimensions under convex combination of invariant probability measures. We also present examples which clarify the validity and limitations of the theorems.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Finite Constellations, Receiver Design, and SIC-free Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</description>

      <title>Holographic Integrated Data and Energy Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the application of metamaterials, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) is expected to achieve a higher spatial diversity gain by enabling the ability to generate any current distribution on the surface. With the aid of electromagnetic (EM) manipulation capability of H-MIMO, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) system can fully exploits the EM channel to realize energy focusing and eliminate inter-user interference, which yields the concept of holographic IDET (H-IDET). In this paper, we invetigate the beamforming designs for H-IDET systems, where the sum-rate of data users (DUs) are maximized by guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirements of energy users (EUs). In order to solve the non-convex functional programming, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based scheme is proposed, wherein the Fourier transform and the equivalence between the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the mean-square error (MSE) are also conceived, followed by the successive convex approximation (SCA) and an initialization scheme to enhance robustness. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed H-IDET scheme outperforms benchmark schemes, especially the one adopting traditional discrete antennas. Besides, the near-field focusing using EM channel model achieves better performance compared to that using the traditional channel model, especially for WPT where the EUs are usually close to the transmitter.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Neural Estimation of Indirect Rate-Distortion Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate-distortion function (RDF) has long been an information-theoretic benchmark for data compression. As its natural extension, the indirect rate-distortion function (iRDF) corresponds to the scenario where the encoder can only access an observation correlated with the source, rather than the source itself. Such scenario is also relevant for modern applications like remote sensing and goal-oriented communication. The iRDF can be reduced into a standard RDF with the distortion measure replaced by its conditional expectation conditioned upon the observation. This reduction, however, leads to a non-trivial challenge when one needs to estimate the iRDF given datasets only, because without statistical knowledge of the joint probability distribution between the source and its observation, the conditional expectation cannot be evaluated. To tackle this challenge, starting from the well known fact that conditional expectation is the minimum mean-squared error estimator and exploiting a Markovian relationship, we identify a functional equivalence between the reduced distortion measure in the iRDF and the solution of a quadratic loss minimization problem, which can be efficiently approximated by neural network approach. We proceed to reformulate the iRDF as a variational problem corresponding to the Lagrangian representation of the iRDF curve, and propose a neural network based approximate solution, integrating the aforementioned distortion measure estimator. Asymptotic analysis guarantees consistency of the solution, and numerical experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Permutation-Free Length 3 Decimal Check Digit Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three codes he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. Apparently, not even a pair of such disjoint 3-digit codes is known. The code developed herein, has the property that the knowledge of any two digits is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. This fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>A proof of P != NP (New symmetric encryption algorithm against any linear attacks and differential attacks)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P vs NP problem is the most important unresolved problem in the field of computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key, and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on "one-way" assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P != NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions, that is, directly proving that P != NP.</description>

Abstract: Improving a 2003 result of Bohman and Holzman, we show that for $n \geq 1$, the Shannon capacity of the complement of the $2n+1$-cycle is at least $(2^{r_n} + 1)^{1/r_n} = 2 + \Omega(2^{-r_n}/r_n)$, where $r_n = \exp(O((\log n)^2))$ is the number of partitions of $2(n-1)$ into powers of $2$. We also discuss a connection between this result and work by Day and Johnson in the context of graph Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in terms of singular values for improved wireless (e.g., rate and power) performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical bounds are derived under popular RIS deployment scenarios to showcase the shaping potentials of BD-RIS on the channel Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. A numerical optimization method is then proposed for a broader range of shaping problems and invoked to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a low-complexity shaping-inspired approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values and the trade-off in manipulating them, resulting in enhanced power gain and achievable rate. Those benefits become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission (hence achieving the asymptotic DoF) at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its singular value shaping proficiency.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum Analysis of Vector OFDM Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</description>

      <title>Bregman-divergence-based Arimoto-Blahut algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the generalized Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to a general function defined over Bregman-divergence system. In existing methods, when linear constraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization. Exploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a minimization-free-iteration algorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum rate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of the optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
