      <title>The bunkbed conjecture is not robust to generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bunkbed conjecture, which has featured in the folklore of probability theory since at least 1985, concerns bond percolation on the product graph $G\Box K_2$. We have two copies $G_0$ and $G_1$ of $G$, and if $x^{(0)}$ and $x^{(1)}$ are the copies of a vertex $x\in V(G)$ in $G_0$ and $G_1$ respectively, then edge $x^{(0)}x^{(1)}$ is present. The conjecture states that, for vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, percolation from $u^{(0)}$ to $v^{(0)}$ is at least as likely as percolation from $u^{(0)}$ to $v^{(1)}$. While the conjecture is widely expected to be true, having attracted significant attention, a general proof has not been forthcoming.
  In this paper we consider three natural generalisations of the bunkbed conjecture; to site percolation, to hypergraphs, and to directed graphs. Our main aim is to show that all these generalisations are false, and to this end we construct a sequence of counterexamples to these statements. However, we also consider under what extra conditions these generalisations might hold, and give some classes of graph for which the bunkbed conjecture for site percolation does hold.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey-type theorem on deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey's Theorem states that a graph $G$ has bounded order if and only if $G$ contains no complete graph $K_n$ or empty graph $E_n$ as its induced subgraph. The Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture says that a graph $G$ has bounded chromatic number if and only if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_n$ or a tree $T$. The deficiency of a graph is the number of vertices that cannot be covered by a maximum matching. In this paper, we prove a Ramsey type theorem for deficiency, i.e., we characterize all the forbidden induced subgraphs for graphs $G$ with bounded deficiency. As an application, we answer a question proposed by Fujita, Kawarabayashi, Lucchesi, Ota, Plummer and Saito (JCTB, 2006).</description>

      <title>$3$-Cut Complexes of Squared Cycle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, the $k$-cut complex of a graph $G$ is the simplicial complex whose facets are the $(|V(G)|-k)$-subsets $\sigma$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ of $G$ such that the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(G) \setminus \sigma$ is disconnected. These complexes first appeared in the master thesis of Denker and were further studied by Bayer et al.\ in [Topology of cut complexes of graphs, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2024]. In the same article, Bayer et al.\ conjectured that for $k \geq 3$, the $k$-cut complexes of squared cycle graphs are shellable. Moreover, they also conjectured about the Betti numbers of these complexes when $k=3$. In this article, we prove these conjectures for $k=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on two involutions and a bijection, we completely determine the difference of the number of $\ell$-regular partitions of $n$ into an even number of parts and into an odd number of parts for all positive integers $\ell&gt;1$, which extends two recent results due to Ballantine and Merca. As an application, we provide a combinatorial proof of Hickerson's identity on the number of partitions into an even and odd number of parts.</description>

      <title>Degrees are Useless in SNORT When Measuring Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snort is a two-player game played on a simple graph in which players alternately colour a vertex such that they do not colour adjacent to their opponents' vertex. In combinatorial game theory, the temperature of a position is a measure of the urgency of moving first. It is known that the temperature of \snort in general is infinite ($K_{1,n}$ has temperature $n$). We show that the temperature in addition can be infinitely larger than the degree of the board being played on. We do so by constructing a family of positions in which the temperature grows twice as fast as the degree of the board.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of chordal graphs using Horn hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 6, Radchenko and Villegas characterized the chordal graphs by their inverse of the independence polynomials being Horn hypergeometric series. In this paper, we reprove their result using some elementary combinatorial methods and also generalize it to PEO graphs that could have a countable number of vertices. Our proof is different from the proof of 6, and it is based on the connection between the inverse of the multi-variate independence polynomials and the multi-colored chromatic polynomials of graphs, established in 1.</description>

      <title>Restricted SDC Edge Cover Pebbling Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restricted edge pebbling distribution is a distribution of pebbles on the edges of $G$ is the placement of pebbles on the edges with the restriction that only an even number of pebbles should be placed on the edges with labels $0$. Given an SDC labeling of $G$, the restricted SDC edge cover pebbling number of a graph $G$, $\psi_{EC}(G)$, is the least positive integer $m$ for which any restricted edge pebbling distribution of $m$ pebbles such that at the end there are no pebbles on the edges having label $0$ will allow the shifting of a pebble simultaneously to all edges with label $1$ using a sequence of restricted edge pebbling moves. We compute the restricted SDC edge cover pebbling number for some graphs</description>

      <title>On the number of digons in arrangements of pairwise intersecting circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing open conjecture of Branko Gr\"unbaum from 1972 states that any simple arrangement of $n$ pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in the plane can have at most $2n-2$ digons. Agarwal et al. proved this conjecture for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in which there is a common point surrounded by all pseudocircles. Recently, Felsner, Roch and Scheucher showed that Gr\"unbaum's conjecture is true for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in which there are three pseudocircles every pair of which create a digon. In this paper we prove this over 50-year-old conjecture of Gr\"unbaum for any simple arrangement of pairwise intersecting circles in the plane.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric divided difference operators and polynomial bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key polynomials, the Demazure atoms, the Schubert polynomials, and even the Schur functions can be defined using divided difference operator. In 2000, Hivert introduced a quasisymmetric analog of the divided difference operator. In particular, replacing it in a natural way in the definition of the Schur functions gives Gessel's fundamental basis. This paper is our attempt to apply the same methods to define the remaining bases and study the results. In particular, we show both the key polynomials and Demazure atoms have natural analogs using Hivert's operator and that the resulting bases occur independently and defined by other means in the work of Assaf and Searles, as the fundemental slide polynomials and the fundamental particle basis respectively. We further explore properties of these two bases, including giving the structure constants for the fundamental particle basis.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes and matroids with vanishing $T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

Abstract: We present a tentative definition for the sum of a sequence of combinatorial games. This sum turns out to be invariant under Conway equivalence and coincides with the classical sum in the case of a converging sequence of real numbers. It coincides with the infinitary natural sum in the case of a sequence of ordinal numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely describe the order ideal (resp. antichain) toggleability space for general fences: the space of statistics which are linear combinations of order ideal (antichain) indicator functions and equal to a constant plus a linear combination of toggleability statistics. This allows us to strengthen some homomesies under rowmotion on fences proven by Elizalde et al. and prove some new homomesy results for combinatorial, piecewise-linear, and birational rowmotion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the edges of any $d$-regular graph can be almost decomposed into paths of length roughly $d$, giving an approximate solution to a problem of Kotzig from 1957. Along the way, we show that almost all of the vertices of a $d$-regular graph can be partitioned into $n/(d+1)$ paths, asymptotically confirming a conjecture of Magnant and Martin from 2009.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a small addition to the note arXiv:1908.04029v2 [math.GT]. We briefly discuss $SC$, a simplicial homotopy model of $K(Z,2)$ constructed from circular permutations. In any dimension, the number of simplices in the model is finite. The complex $SC$ naturally manifests as a simplicial set representing "minimally" triangulated circle bundles over simplicial bases. On the other hand, the homotopy $|SC| \approx B(U(1)) \approx K(Z,2)$ appears to be a canonical fact from the foundations of crossed simplicial groups theory.</description>

      <title>An application of node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality to a protein complex hypernetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of graph centrality measures applied to biological networks, such as protein interaction networks, underpins much research into identifying key players within biological processes. This approach however is restricted to dyadic interactions and it is well-known that in many instances interactions are polyadic. In this study we illustrate the merit of using hypergraph centrality applied to a hypernetwork as an alternative. Specifically, we review and propose an extension to a recently introduced node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality model which provides mutually dependent node and edge centralities. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein complex hypernetwork is used as an example application with nodes representing proteins and hyperedges representing protein complexes. The resulting rankings of the nodes and edges are considered to see if they provide insight into the essentiality of the proteins and complexes. We find that certain variations of the model predict essentiality more accurately and that the degree-based variation illustrates that the centrality-lethality rule extends to a hypergraph setting. In particular, through exploitation of the models flexibility, we identify small sets of proteins densely populated with essential proteins.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both ``direct'' and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both ``direct'' and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for ``loose colorings'' of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Graph Isomorphism, Coloring, and Distance Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information, nonlocal games are particularly useful for differentiating classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations. An example of differentiation is given by the principle of no-collapse of communication complexity, which is often interpreted as necessary for a feasible physical theory. It is satisfied by quantum correlations but violated by some non-signalling ones.
  In this work, we investigate this principle in the context of three nonlocal games related to graph theory, starting from the well-known graph isomorphism and graph coloring games, and introducing a new game, the vertex distance game, with a parameter $D\in\mathbb N$, that generalizes the former two to some extent. For these three games, we prove that perfect non-signalling strategies collapse communication complexity under favorable conditions. We also define a refinement of fractional isomorphism of graphs, namely D-fractional isomorphisms, and we show that this characterizes perfect non-signalling strategies for the vertex distance game. Surprisingly, we observe that non-signalling strategies provide a finer distinction for the new game compared to classical and quantum strategies since the parameter D is visible only in the non-signalling setting.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative largeness of $\textit{de Polignac numbers}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number $m$ is said to be a $\textit{de Polignac number}$, if infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes exist, such that $m$ can be written as the difference of those consecutive prime numbers. Recently in [ W. D. Banks: Consecutive primes and IP sets, arXiv:2403.10637.], using arguments from the Ramsey theory, W. D. Banks proved that the collection of $\textit{de Polignac number}$ is an $IP^\star$ set (Though his original statement is relatively weaker, an iterative application of pigeonhole principle/ theory of ultrafilters shows that this statement is sufficient to conclude the set is $IP^\star$). As a consequence, we have this collection as an additively syndetic set. In this article, we show that this collection is also a multiplicative syndetic set. In our proof, we use combinatorial arguments and the tools from the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification: Theory and Applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin,2012.]).</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings and intersection cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hilbert series of four objects arising in the Chow-theoretic and Kazhdan-Lusztig framework of matroids. These are, respectively, the Hilbert series of the Chow ring, the augmented Chow ring, the intersection cohomology module, and its stalk at the empty flat. We develop a parallelism between the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its Chow ring. This extends to a parallelism between the $Z$-polynomial of a matroid and the Hilbert series of its augmented Chow ring. This suggests to bring ideas from one framework to the other. Our two main motivations are the real-rootedness conjecture for all of these polynomials, and the problem of computing them. We provide several intrinsic definitions of these invariants; also, by leveraging that they are valuations under matroid polytope subdivisions, we deduce a fast way for computing them for a large class of matroids. Uniform matroids are a case of combinatorial interest; we link the resulting polynomials with certain real-rooted families such as the (binomial) Eulerian polynomials, and we settle a conjecture of Hameister, Rao, and Simpson. Furthermore, we prove the real-rootedness of the Hilbert series of the augmented Chow rings of uniform matroids via a result of Haglund and Zhang; and in addition, we prove a version of a conjecture of Gedeon in the Chow setting: uniform matroids maximize coefficient-wisely these polynomials for matroids with fixed rank and size. By relying on the nonnegativity of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the semi-small decompositions of Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot, and Wang, we strengthen the unimodality of the Hilbert series of Chow rings, augmented Chow rings, and intersection cohomologies to $\gamma$-positivity, a property for palindromic polynomials that lies between unimodality and real-rootedness; this settles a conjecture of Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi.</description>

      <title>On regular graphs with \v{S}olt\'es vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W(G)$ be the Wiener index of a graph $G$. We say that a vertex $v \in V(G)$ is a \v{S}olt\'es vertex in $G$ if $W(G - v) = W(G)$, i.e. the Wiener index does not change if the vertex $v$ is removed. In 1991, \v{S}olt\'es posed the problem of identifying all connected graphs $G$ with the property that all vertices of $G$ are \v{S}olt\'es vertices. The only such graph known to this day is $C_{11}$. As the original problem appears to be too challenging, several relaxations were studied: one may look for graphs with at least $k$ \v{S}olt\'es vertices; or one may look for $\alpha$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs, i.e. graphs where the ratio between the number of \v{S}olt\'es vertices and the order of the graph is at least $\alpha$. Note that the original problem is, in fact, to find all $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs. We intuitively believe that every $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graph has to be regular and has to possess a high degree of symmetry. Therefore, we are interested in regular graphs that contain one or more \v{S}olt\'es vertices. In this paper, we present several partial results. For every $r\ge 1$ we describe a construction of an infinite family of cubic $2$-connected graphs with at least $2^r$ \v{S}olt\'es vertices. Moreover, we report that a computer search on publicly available collections of vertex-transitive graphs did not reveal any $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graph. We are only able to provide examples of large $\frac{1}{3}$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs that are obtained by truncating certain cubic vertex-transitive graphs. This leads us to believe that no $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graph other than $C_{11}$ exists.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of subdivisions of multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $d\leq3$, we construct a finite set $F_d$ of multigraphs such that for each graph $H$ of girth at least $5$ obtained from a multigraph $G$ by subdividing each edge at least two times, $H$ has twin-width at most $d$ if and only if $G$ has no minor in $F_d$. This answers a question of Berg\'{e}, Bonnet, and D\'{e}pr\'{e}s asking for the structure of graphs $G$ such that each long subdivision of $G$ has twin-width $4$. As a corollary, we show that the $7\times7$ grid has twin-width $4$, which answers a question of Schidler and Szeider.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Subcubes of the $n$-Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the year 1990, B\'ela Bollob\'as, Imre Leader and Andrew Radcliffe considered the following combinatorial problem: given three parameters k, n and q, find a set of k vertices in the binary n-cube which contains a maximal number of q-dimensional subcubes. It was shown that an optimal solution is given by the k vertices which coincide with the binary representations of the number 0 , 1 , ... , k-1. Two proofs were presented. The proof given by Bollobas and Leader is particularly elegant and short. Here we show that also the other proof, the one given by Bollobas and Radcliffe, becomes quite simple and short when it is combined with a lemma from Graham whose publication dates back to 1970. As a second application of Graham's lemma, we solve a recursive equation (related to the optimization problem that we discussed before) that might be considered interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with large shadow degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform family $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. The shadow family $\partial \mathcal{F}$ is the family of $(k-1)$-element sets that are contained in some members of $\mathcal{F}$. The shadow degree (or minimum positive co-degree) of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the maximum integer $r$ such that every $E\in \partial \mathcal{F}$ is contained in at least $r$ members of $\mathcal{F}$. In 2021, Balogh, Lemons and Palmer determined the maximum size of an intersecting $k$-uniform family with shadow degree at least $r$ for $n\geq n_0(k,r)$, where $n_0(k,r)$ is doubly exponential in $k$ for $4\leq r\leq k$. In the present paper, we present a short proof of this result for $n\geq 2(r+1)^rk \frac{\binom{2k-1}{k}}{\binom{2r-1}{r}}$ and $4\leq r\leq k$.</description>

      <title>TreePIR: Efficient Private Retrieval of Merkle Proofs via Tree Colorings with Fast Indexing and Zero Storage Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05211v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Batch Private Information Retrieval (batch-PIR) scheme allows a client to retrieve multiple data items from a database without revealing them to the storage server(s). Most existing approaches for batch-PIR are based on batch codes, in particular, probabilistic batch codes (PBC) (Angel et al. S&amp;P'18), which incur large storage overheads. In this work, we show that \textit{zero} storage overhead is achievable for tree-shaped databases. In particular, we develop TreePIR, a novel approach tailored made for private retrieval of the set of nodes along an arbitrary root-to-leaf path in a Merkle tree with no storage redundancy. This type of trees has been widely implemented in many real-world systems such as Amazon DynamoDB, Google's Certificate Transparency, and blockchains. Tree nodes along a root-to-leaf path forms the well-known Merkle proof. TreePIR, which employs a novel tree coloring, outperforms PBC, a fundamental component in state-of-the-art batch-PIR schemes (Angel et al. S&amp;P'18, Mughees-Ren S&amp;P'23, Liu et al. S&amp;P'24), in all metrics, achieving $3\times$ lower total storage and $1.5$-$2\times$ lower computation and communication costs. Most notably, TreePIR has $8$-$160\times$ lower setup time and its polylog-complexity indexing algorithm is $19$-$160\times$ faster than PBC for trees of $2^{10}$-$2^{24}$ leaves.</description>

      <title>Trees and co-trees in planar 3-connected graphs An easier proof via Schnyder woods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a 3-connected planar graph. Define the co-tree of a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ as the graph induced by the dual edges of $E(G)-E(T)$. The well-known cut-cycle duality implies that the co-tree is itself a tree. Let a $k$-tree be a spanning tree with maximum degree $k$. In 1970, Gr\"unbaum conjectured that every 3-connected planar graph contains a 3-tree whose co-tree is also a 3-tree. In 2014, Biedl showed that every such graph contains a 5-tree whose co-tree is a 5-tree. In this paper, we present an easier proof of Biedl's result</description>

      <title>Getting to the Root of the Problem: Sums of Squares for Infinite Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph represents its maximum density as an induced subgraph over all possible sequences of graphs of size growing to infinity. This invariant of graphs has been extensively studied since its introduction in $1975$ by Pippenger and Golumbic. In $2017$, Czabarka, Sz\'ekely and Wagner extended this notion to leaf-labeled rooted binary trees, which are objects widely studied in the field of phylogenetics. They obtain the first results and bounds for the densities and inducibilities of such trees. Following up on their work, we apply Razborov's flag algebra theory to this setting, introducing the flag algebra of rooted leaf-labeled binary trees. This framework allows us to use polynomial optimization methods, based on semidefinite programming, to efficiently obtain new upper bounds for the inducibility of trees and to improve existing ones. Additionally, we obtain the first outer approximations of profiles of trees, which represent all possible simultaneous densities of a pair of trees. Finally, we are able to prove the non-convexity of some of these profiles.</description>

      <title>A skew Specht perspective of RoCK blocks and cuspidal systems for KLR algebras in affine type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cuspidal systems parameterize KLR algebra representations via root partitions $\pi$, where simple modules $L(\pi)$ arise as heads of proper standard modules. Working in affine type A with an arbitrary convex preorder, we construct explicit skew diagrams $\zeta(\pi)$ such that the skew Specht module $S^{\zeta(\pi)}$ has simple head $L(\pi)$ and a filtration by proper standard modules. This result arises from an in-depth study of the combinatorial interplay between cuspidal systems and RoCK cyclotomic KLR algebras.</description>
