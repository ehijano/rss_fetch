      <title>Period-rigidity of one-relator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow in this paper a recent line of work, consisting in characterizing the periodically rigid finitely generated groups, i.e., the groups for which every subshift of finite type which is weakly aperiodic is also strongly aperiodic. In particular, we show that every finitely generated group admitting a presentation with one reduced relator and at least $3$ generators is periodically rigid if and only if it is either virtually cyclic or torsion-free virtually $\mathbb Z^2$. This proves a special case of a recent conjecture of Bitar (2024). We moreover prove that period rigidity is preserved under taking subgroups of finite indices. Using a recent theorem of MacManus (2023), we derive from our results that Bitar's conjecture holds in groups whose Cayley graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Routing Problems in the Age of Semi-Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are in the midst of a semi-autonomous era in urban transportation in which varying forms of vehicle autonomy are gradually being introduced. This phase of partial autonomy is anticipated by some to span a few decades due to various challenges, including budgetary constraints to upgrade the infrastructure and technological obstacles in the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles (AV) at scale. In this study, we introduce the vehicle routing problem in a semi-autonomous environment (VRP-SA) where the road network is not fully AV-enabled in the sense that a portion of it is either not suitable for AVs or requires additional resources in real-time (e.g., remote control) for AVs to pass through. Moreover, such resources are scarce and usually subject to a budget constraint. An exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated to minimize the total routing cost of service in this environment. We propose a two-phase algorithm based on a family of feasibility recovering sub-problems (FRP) to solve the VRP-SA efficiently. Our algorithm is implemented and tested on a new set of instances that are tailored for the VRP-SA by adding stratified grid road networks to the benchmark instances. The result demonstrates a reduction of up to 37.5% in vehicle routing costs if the fleet actively exploits the AV-enabled roads in the environment. Additional analysis reveals that cost reduction is higher with more budget and longer operational hours.</description>

      <title>Unrealized Expectations: Comparing AI Methods vs Classical Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI methods, such as generative models and reinforcement learning, have recently been applied to combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, especially NP-hard ones. This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers.
  We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan &amp; Efthymiou (2015).</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-limited Dominating Broadcasts in Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a graph $ G $, a subset of vertices $ S $ is called an efficient dominating set (EDS) if every vertex in the graph is uniquely dominated by exactly one vertex in $ S $. A graph is said to be efficiently dominatable if it contains an EDS. Additionally, a function $ f: V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, \dots, k\} $ is termed a $ k $-limited dominating broadcast if, for every vertex $ u \in V(G) $, there exists a vertex $ v $, with $ f(v) \geq 1$ such that $ d(u, v) \leq f(v) $. A vertex $u$ is said to be dominated by a vertex $v$. In this work, we unify these two concepts to explore the notion of efficient $k$-limited broadcast domination in graphs. A $ k $-limited dominating broadcast $f$ is called an efficient $k$-limited dominating broadcast ($k$-$ELDB$) if each vertex in the graph is dominated exactly once. The minimum value of $k$ for which the given graph $G$ has $k$-$ELDB$ is defined as $mcr(G)$. We prove determining $mcr(G)$ is NP-Complete for general graphs and explore the $mcr(G)$ values and other related parameters on standard graphs and their products.</description>

      <title>The $E$-base of finite semidistributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a well-known representation of closure spaces and their closure lattices. This representation is not unique, though, and a closure space usually admits multiple IBs. Among these, the canonical base, the canonical direct base as well as the $D$-base aroused significant attention due to their structural and algorithmic properties. Recently, a new base has emerged from the study of free lattices: the $E$-base. It is a refinement of the $D$-base that, unlike the aforementioned IBs, does not always accurately represent its associated closure space. This leads to an intriguing question: for which classes of (closure) lattices do closure spaces have a valid $E$-base? Lower bounded lattices are known to form such a class. In this paper, we prove that for semidistributive lattices, the $E$-base is both valid and minimum.</description>

      <title>Fair Schedules for Single Round Robin Tournaments with Ranked Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure to capture fairness of a schedule in a single round robin (SRR) tournament when participants are ranked by strength. To prevent distortion of the outcome of an SRR tournament as well as to guarantee equal treatment, we argue that each participant should face its opponents when ranked by strength in an alternating fashion with respect to the home/away advantage. Here, the home/away advantage captures a variety of situations. We provide an explicit construction proving that so-called ranking-fair schedules exist when the number of participants is a multiple of 4. Further, we give a formulation that outputs ranking-fair schedules when they exist. Finally, we show that the most popular method to come to a schedule for an SRR tournament, does not allow ranking-fair schedules when the number of teams exceeds 8. These findings impact the type of schedules to be used for SRR tournaments.</description>
