      <title>Gravitational Communication: Fundamentals, State-of-the-Art and Future Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of fundamentals and the latest research progress in gravitational communication, with a detailed historical review of gravitational wave generation and detection. Key aspects covered include the evolution of detection sensitivity and generation methods, modulation techniques, and gravitational communication channel. While gravitational wave communication holds promise for overcoming limitations in traditional electromagnetic communication, significant challenges remain, particularly in wave generation and detection. The paper also explores various modulation techniques and examines environmental influences on gravitational wave transmission. A comparative discussion is provided between gravitational and classical communication modalities -- including electromagnetic, quantum, particle, acoustic, and optical communications -- highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. Furthermore, potential application and future vision for gravitational communication are also envisioned. Finally, Potential research directions to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical applications of gravitational wave communication are investigated.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reflects on mechanics as an epistemological framework on the state of a physical system to regard dynamics as the distribution of mechanical properties over spacetime coordinates. The resulting distribution is taken to be the partition function of the relevant physical quantities over a space-time parametrized by coordinates. The partition yields a probabilistic interpretation that, based on Feynman's path integral formulation, leads to a dynamical law that generalizes the Schr\"odinger equation. A variety of systems can be put into the form proposed here, including particles in potentials, as well as matter and interaction fields. The main advantage of the proposed framework is that it presents the space of properties separately from that of the space of coordinates, whereas the dynamical law can be interpreted as the equation of two differential structures, one from each of these spaces. The resulting framework shows possibilities to further study physical quantities that relate directly to the space-time coordinates, whose dynamics is best described in thermodynamical, rather than Hamiltonian, terms. A notable case being the theory of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Preons, Braid Topology, and Representations of Fundamental Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle phenomenology, preon models study compositional rules of standard model interactions. In spite of empirical success, mathematical underpinnings of preon models in terms of group representation theory have not been fully worked out. Here, we address this issue while clarifying the relation between different preon models. In particular, we focus on two prominent models: Bilson-Thompson's helon model, and Lambek's 4-vector model. We determine the mapping between helon model particle states and representation theory of Lie algebras. Braided ribbon diagrams of the former represent on-shell states of spinors of the Lorentz group. Braids correspond to chirality, and twists, to charges. We note that this model captures only the $SU(3)_c\times U(1)_{em}$ sector of the standard model. We then map the twists of helon diagrams to the weight polytope of $SU(3)_c \times U(1)_{em}$. The braid structure maps to chiral states of fermions. We also show that Lambek's 4-vector can be recovered from helon diagrams. Alongside, we introduce a new 5-vector representation derived from the weight lattice. This representation contains both, the correct interactions found in 4-vectors and the inclusion of chirality found in helons. Additionally, we demonstrate topological analogues of CPT transformations in helon diagrams. Interestingly, the braid diagrams of the helon model are the only ones that are self-consistent with CPT invariance. In contrast to field-theoretic approaches, the compositional character of preon models offers an analogous particle-centric perspective on fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Can corrections to gravity at galactic distances be decisive to the problem of dark matter and dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are Dark Matter the result of uncalculated addition derivatives? The need to introduce dark matter dark becomes unnecessary if we consider that, the phenomenon of dark matter is a result of not computing the additional derivatives of the equation of motion. For this purpose, we use higher derivatives in the form of non-local variables, known as the Ostrogradsky formalism. As a mathematician, Ostrogradsky considered the dependence of the Lagrange function on acceleration and its higher derivatives with respect to time. This is the case that fully correspond with the real frame of reference, and that can be both inertial and non-inertial frames. The problem of dark matter and dark energy presented starting from basic observations to explain the different results in theory and experiment. The study of galactic motion, especially the rotation curves, showed that a large amount of dark matter can be found mainly in galactic halos. The search for dark matter and dark energy has not confirmed with the experimental discovery of it, so we use Ostrogradsky formalities to explain the effects described above, so that the need to introduce dark matter and dark energy disappears. We hope that this description can lead to a Steady State Model (SSM) of the Universe.</description>
