      <description>arXiv:2504.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems, consisting of three gravitationally bound stars, play a fundamental role in a wide array of astrophysical processes, from stellar evolution to the formation of exotic objects and gravitational wave sources. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamics and evolution of triple stellar systems, highlighting their crucial role in shaping stellar populations and driving diverse astrophysical phenomena. We begin by discussing the observed properties of triples, including their frequency and orbital configurations, emphasizing the challenges in characterizing these systems. We then delve into the intricate dynamics of triples, exploring hierarchical, secular, quasi-secular, and chaotic regimes, with particular attention to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism and its extensions. The interplay between stellar evolution and triple dynamics is examined, including mass loss, mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and supernovae effects. We discuss the development and applications of triple population synthesis codes, demonstrating their power in modeling complex evolutionary scenarios and predicting observational outcomes. Finally, we emphasize the unique role of triple evolution in producing a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from interacting binaries and stellar mergers to explosive transients and gravitational wave sources, underscoring the importance of triple systems in our understanding of stars and stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statistics of Solar Flares and Flare Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of interval times between recurrent discrete events, such as Solar and stellar flares, reflects their underlying dynamics. Log-normal functions provide good fits to the interval time distributions of many recurrent astronomical events. The width of the fit is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes its underlying dynamics, in analogy to the critical exponents of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as it often is over a wide range, then the width of the log-normal is independent of the detector sensitivity in that range, making it a robust metric. Analyzing two catalogues of Solar flares over periods ranging from 46 days to 37 years, we find that the widths of log-normal fits to the intervals between flares are wider than those of shot noise, indicating memory in the underlying dynamics even over a time much shorter than the Solar cycle. In contrast, the statistics of flare stars are consistent with shot noise (no memory). We suggest that this is a consequence of the production of Solar flares in localized transient active regions with varying mean flare rate, but that the very energetic flares of flare stars result from global magnetic rearrangement that reinitializes their magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Disk-Star Alignment I: Pre-Main-Sequence Stellar Parameters and the Statistical Alignment Between Disks and Stellar Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers generally assume planet-forming disks are aligned with the rotation of their host star. However, recent observations have shown evidence of warping in protoplanetary disks. One can measure the statistical alignment between the inclination angles of the disk and stellar spin using the projected rotational velocity, radius, and rotation period of the star and interferometric measurements of the protoplanetary disk. Such work is challenging due to the difficulty in measuring the properties of young stars and biases in methods to combine them for population studies. Here, we provide an overview of the required observables, realistic uncertainties, and complications when using them to constrain the orientation of the system. We show in several tests that we are able to constrain the uncertainties on the necessary stellar parameters to better than 5% in most cases. We show that by using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we can account for many of the systematic effects (e.g., biases in measured stellar and disk orientations) by fitting for the alignments of each system simultaneously. We demonstrate our hierarchical model on a realistic synthetic sample and verify that we can recover our input alignment distribution to $\leq$5$^{\circ}$ with a modest ($\simeq$30 star) sample. As the sample of systems with disk inclinations grows, future studies can improve upon our approach with a three-dimensional treatment of misalignment and better handling of non-Gaussian errors.</description>

      <title>GALEX UV survey of magnetic chemically peculiar stars in the Kepler prime field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars are strongly magnetic upper main-sequence stars that exhibit light rotational variability due to an uneven surface distribution of certain peculiar elements, which may appear in phase at certain wavelengths and in antiphase to the flux at other wavelengths. We present a study of the properties of photometric variability of a sample of confirmed mCP stars (mostly Ap/CP2 stars), mCP star candidates, and several non-CP stars in the near ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions based on observational data from the GALEX and Kepler prime missions. Antiphase variations between the near ultraviolet and optical light curves are observed in the majority of mCP stars. We investigate the presence of a correlation of the variability amplitudes in both wavelength regions with effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity and calculate model atmospheres, spectral energy distributions and synthetic light curves to connect our findings to theoretical models. While the theoretical calculations show that, at fixed abundances, a clear correlation between the light curve amplitude ratios and effective temperature is expected, our sample does not show any correlation with the investigated properties. This may be due to the highly individualistic abundance patterns of our sample stars, which are the main contributors to the line blanketing in different wavelength bands.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical versus Theoretical Stellar Population Models: a comparison with Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key tool for deriving the age, metallicity, radial velocity and reddening of star clusters from their integrated spectra. Using a sample of 129 star clusters with high-quality spectra, we analyze the uncertainties associated with selecting an empirical versus a theoretical stellar spectral library in the SPS models. We find that the fits from the different models agree on the goodness of fit metrics and inferred reddening. However, the derived age and metallicity can be affected by the choice of the stellar library, with synthetic libraries tending to give lower age and metallicity, especially for spectra with low SNR. Ages and reddening values from SSP-equivalent fits are consistent with the multi-population fits, however, SSP-equivalent metallicities are affected by the coarse coverage of the SPS grid in [Fe/H]. When comparing the spectral fitting results with the literature, we find that (1) all models underestimate age for old and metal-poor systems; (2) on average, SPS models based on synthetic stellar libraries better match the isochrone ages and metallicities from high-resolution stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Effect of Nonlinear Surface Inflows into Activity Belts on Solar Cycle Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converging flows are visible around bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) on the solar surface, according to observations. Average flows are created by these inflows combined, and the strength of these flows depends on the amount of flux present during the solar cycle. In models of the solar cycle, this average flow can be depicted as perturbations to the meridional flow. In this article, we study the effects of introducing surface inflow to the surface flux transport models (SFT) as a possible nonlinear mechanism in the presence of latitude quenching for an inflow profile whose amplitude varies within a cycle depending on the magnetic activity. The results show that including surface inflows in the model in the presence of both LQ and tilt quenching (TQ) produced a polar field within a $\pm$1$\sigma$ of an average cycle polar field ($\sigma$ is the standard deviation) and a correlation coefficient of 0.85. We confirm that including inflows produces a lower net contribution to the dipole moment (10\,--\,25\%). Furthermore, the relative importance of LQ vs. inflows is inversely correlated with the dynamo effectivity range ($\lambda_{R}$). With no decay term, introducing inflows into the model resulted in a less significant net contribution to the dipole moment. Including inflows in the SFT model shows a possible nonlinear relationship between the surface inflows and the solar dipole moment, suggesting a potential nonlinear mechanism contributing to the saturation of the global dynamo. For lower $\lambda_R$ ($\lessapprox$ 10 $^\circ$), TQ always dominates LQ, and for higher $\lambda_R$ LQ dominate. However, including inflows will make the domination a little bit earlier in case of having a decay term in the model.</description>

      <title>Launching of asymmetric outflows from the star-disk magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In resistive and viscous magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we obtain axial outflows launched from the innermost magnetosphere of a star-disk system. The launched outflows are found to be asymmetric. We find the part of the parameter space corresponding to quasi-stationary axial outflows and compute the mass load and angular momentum flux in such outflows. We display the obtained geometry of the solutions and measure the speed of propagation and rotation of the obtained axial outflows.</description>

      <title>Evolution of interacting coronal mass ejections driving the great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arrival of a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Earth resulted in a great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, the strongest storm in the last two decades. We investigate the kinematic and thermal evolution of the successive CMEs to understand their interaction en route to Earth. We attempt to find the dynamics, thermodynamics, and magnetic field signatures of CME-CME interactions. Our focus is to compare the thermal state of CMEs near the Sun and in their post-interaction phase at 1 AU. The 3D kinematics of six identified Earth-directed CMEs were determined using the GCS model. The flux rope internal state (FRIS) model is implemented to estimate the CMEs' polytropic index and temperature evolution from their measured kinematics. The thermal states of the interacting CMEs are examined using in-situ at 1 AU. Our study determined the interaction heights of selected CMEs and confirmed their interaction that led to the formation of complex ejecta identified at 1 AU. The plasma, magnetic field, and thermal characteristics of magnetic ejecta (ME) within the complex ejecta and other substructures, such as interaction regions (IRs) within two ME and double flux rope-like structures within a single ME, show the possible signatures of CME-CME interaction in in-situ observations. The FRIS-model-derived thermal states for individual CMEs reveal their diverse thermal evolution near the Sun, with most CMEs transitioning to an isothermal state at 6-9 Rsun, except for CME4, which exhibits an adiabatic state due to a slower expansion rate. The complex ejecta at 1 AU shows a predominant heat-release state in electrons, while the ions show a bimodal distribution of thermal states. On comparing the characteristics of CMEs near the Sun and at 1 AU, we suggest that such one-to-one comparison is difficult due to CME-CME interactions significantly influencing their post-interaction characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of Red Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), as the descendants of OB-type stars and the progenitors of supernovae, provide crucial insights into the evolution of massive stars, particularly in binary systems. Previous studies show that the binary fraction of RSGs ($\approx$ 15% - 40%) is significantly lower than that of their predecessors ($\approx$ 50% - 70%). In this work, we investigate the binary fraction of RSGs with the recently selected largest samples of 4695 and 2097 RSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. The binary system with a hot companion (O-, B- and A-type star) is identified by detecting the ultraviolet (UV) excess in the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from ultraviolet to mid-infrared after subtracting the model SED of RSG since RSGs are very weak in the UV band. It is found that the lower limit of binarity is 30.2% $\pm$ 0.7% and 32.2% $\pm$ 1% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. If the sample is limited to luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction becomes 26.6% $\pm$ 1.1% and 26.4% $\pm$ 1.7% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The derived binary fraction is valid in the range of $\sim$ 2.3 &lt; $\log P / [\text{d}]$ &lt; $\sim$ 8. Our study suggests that roughly one-third of massive stars host a third companion within $\sim$ 30,000 AU. In addition, 15 RSGs are also identified as binary via HST/STIS spectra, and a handful of the binaries identified by the SED fitting are confirmed by their light curve and radial velocity dispersion. The stellar parameters of the companions, i.e. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $R$, $L$ and log $g$, are calculated by model fitting.</description>

      <title>Do accretion-powered stellar winds help spin down T Tauri stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How T Tauri stars remain slowly rotating while still accreting material is a long-standing puzzle. Current models suggest that these stars may lose angular momentum through magnetospheric ejections of disk material (MEs) and accretion-powered stellar winds (APSWs). The individual contribution of each mechanism to the stellar spin evolution, however, is unclear. We explore how these two scenarios could be distinguished by applying stellar spin models to near-term observations. We produce synthetic stellar populations of accreting Class II stars with spreads in the parameters governing the spin-down processes and find that an APSW strongly affects the ratio of the disk truncation radius to the corotation radius, $\mathcal{R} = R_\mathrm{t}/R_\mathrm{co}$. The ME and APSW scenarios are distinguished to high confidence when at least $N_\mathrm{crit}\gtrsim 250$ stars have values measured for $\mathcal{R}$. Newly developed lightcurve analysis methods enable measuring $\mathcal{R}$ for enough stars to distinguish the spin-down scenarios in the course of upcoming observing campaigns.</description>

      <title>Observations of the formation of a proto-spot in a pre-existing field environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar emerging flux regions (EFRs) form active regions (ARs) that generally evolve in a pre-existing magnetic environment in the solar atmosphere. Reconfiguration of the small- and large-scale magnetic connectivities is invoked to explain a plethora of energy release phenomena observed at the sites of EFRs. These include brightening events, surges, and jets, whose trigger and relationship are still unclear. In this context, we study the formation of a proto-spot in AR NOAA~11462 by analyzing spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic measurements taken by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer along the Fe~I 630.2~nm and Ca~II 854.2~nm lines on April 17, 2012. We complement these high-resolution data with simultaneous SDO satellite observations. The proto-spot forms from magnetic flux emerged into the photosphere that coalesces following plasma flows in its surrounding. The chromospheric and higher atmosphere observations show that flux emergence occurs in a pre-existing magnetic environment, with small- and large-scale coronal arcades that seemingly shape the proto-spot formation in the upper atmospheric layers. In addition, in the chromosphere we observe an arch filament system and repeated intense brightening events and surges, likely due to magnetic interactions of the new flux with the pre-existing overlying coronal field. These phenomena are observed since early stages of the new flux emergence.</description>

      <title>Volume-limited sample of low-mass red giant stars, the progenitors of hot subdwarf stars II. Sample validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the progenitors of long-period hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries, which form when low-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars lose their envelopes through stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOV) near the tip of the RGB. We aim to expand our previous volume-limited sample of 211 stars within 200 pc to 500 pc and validate it. Additionally, our goal is to provide the distribution of stellar parameters for these stars. We refined the original sample using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and interstellar extinction measurements. High-resolution spectra for 230 stars were obtained between 2019 and 2023 using the CORALIE spectrograph. To confirm or discard binarity, we combined astrometric parameters from Gaia with the resulting radial velocity variations. We derived the distribution of stellar parameters using atmospheric and evolutionary models, confirming that 82% of stars in our sample are indeed RGB stars using the equivalent evolutionary phase. The remaining 18% are red clump (RC) contaminants, which was expected due to the overlapping of RGB and RC stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. Additionally, 75% of the confirmed RGB stars have a high probability of being part of a binary system. Comparison with the literature shows good overall agreement with a scatter $\lesssim 15\%$ in stellar parameters, while the masses show somewhat higher dispersion ($\sim 20\%$).</description>

      <title>Coupling hydrodynamics with comoving frame radiative transfer. III. The wind regime of early-type B hypergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants (BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study, we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+). Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs. However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile, deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity. Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred for zeta1 Sco.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>Measuring the asymmetric expansion of the Fe ejecta of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: Detection of a sub-Neptune in a 6 day period orbit around the M dwarf Gl 410</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search of exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs is a crucial milestone to perform the census of planetary systems in the vicinity of our Solar System. Since 2018 our team is carrying a radial-velocity blind search program for planets around nearby M dwarfs with the near-IR spectro-polarimeter and velocimeter SPIRou at the CFHT and the optical velocimeter SOPHIE at the OHP in France. Here we present our results on Gl 410, a 0.55 Msun 480+-150 Myr old active M dwarf distant 12 pc. We use the line-by-line (LBL) technique to measure the RVs with SPIRou and the template matching method with SOPHIE. Three different methods, two based in principal component analysis (PCA), are used to clean the SPIRou RVs for systematics. Gaussian processes (GP) modeling is applied to correct the SOPHIE RVs for stellar activity. The l1 and apodize sine periodogram (ASP) analysis is used to search for planetary signals in the SPIRou data taking into account activity indicators. We analyse TESS data and search for planetary transits. We report the detection of a M sin(i)=8.4+-1.3 Mearth sub-Neptune planet at a period of 6.020+-0.004 days in circular orbit with SPIRou. The same signal, although with lower significance, is also retrieved in the SOPHIE RV data after correction for activity using a GP trained on SPIRou's longitudinal magnetic field (Bl) measurements. TESS data indicates that the planet is not transiting. We find within the SPIRou wPCA RVs tentative evidence for two additional planetary signals at 2.99 and 18.7 days. In conclusion, infrared RVs are a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets around active M dwarfs, care should be taken however to correct/filter systematics generated by residuals of the telluric correction or small structures in the detector plane. The LBL technique combined with PCA offers a promising way to reach this objective. Further monitoring of Gl 410 is necessary.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: A Wide-field Photometric Metallicity Study of the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii ($\rm r_h$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 4.0$ to $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 0.6$, includes six extremely metal-poor candidates ($\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) without previous spectroscopic observations, and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from $-3.35 \pm 0.18 \rm \ dex \, deg^{-1}$ for stars inside $\sim 1\ \rm r_h$ to $-0.56 \pm 0.26 \rm \ dex \, deg^{-1}$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>

      <title>Model of X-ray and extreme-UV emission from magnetically heated atmospheres in classical T Tauri stars: Case study of TW Hya</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoevaporation caused by X-rays and ultraviolet radiation from the central star has attracted attention as a key process driving the dispersal of protoplanetary discs. Although numerous models have been used to investigate the photoevaporation process, their conclusions vary, partly due to differences in the adopted radiation spectra of the host star in particular in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray bands. This study aims to construct the EUV and (soft) X-ray emission spectrum from pre-main-sequence stars using a physics-based model. While the high-energy radiation sources of pre-main-sequence stars include accretion shocks and magnetically heated coronae, this study focuses on the latter. An MHD model capable of reproducing the coronal emission of main-sequence stars is applied to a pre-main-sequence star TW Hya, and its feasibility is assessed by comparing the predicted and observed emission-line intensities. We find that the emission lines formed at coronal temperatures ($T = 4-13 \times 10^6$ K) are reproduced in intensity within a factor of three. Emission lines from lower-temperature ($T &lt; 4 \times 10^6$ K) plasmas are systematically underestimated, with typical intensities at 10-30% of observed values, consistent with previous findings that these emissions predominantly originate from accretion shocks. Emission lines emitted at extremely high temperatures ($T &gt; 13 \times 10^6$ K) account for only about 1-10% of the observed values, likely due to the neglect of transient heating associated with flares. These results indicate that the quiescent coronal emission of pre-main-sequence stars can be adequately modeled using a physics-based approach.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-duration Galactic-bulge microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 produced relativistic astrometric deflections of the source star, which we measured using HST observations taken at 8 epochs over ~6 years. Analysis of the microlensing light curve and astrometry led our group (followed by other independent groups) to conclude that the lens is an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH) -- the first and only one unambiguously discovered to date. There have now been three additional epochs of HST observations, increasing the astrometric time baseline to 11 years. Additionally, the ground-based OGLE data have been updated. We have re-analyzed the data, including the new HST astrometry, and photometry obtained with 16 different telescopes. The source lies only 0.4 arcsec from a bright neighbor, making it crucial to perform precise subtraction of its point-spread function (PSF) in the astrometric measurements of the source. Moreover, we show that it is essential to perform a separate PSF subtraction for each individual HST frame as part of the reductions. Our final solution yields a lens mass of 7.15 +/- 0.83 solar mass. Combined with the lack of detected light from the lens at late HST epochs, the BH nature of the lens is conclusively verified. The BH lies at a distance of 1.52 +/- 0.15 kpc, and is moving with a space velocity of 51.1 +/- 7.5 km/s relative to the stars in the neighborhood. We compare our results with those of other studies and discuss reasons for the differences. We searched for binary companions of the BH at a range of separations but found no evidence for any.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur depending on the physical properties of the external layers surrounding the flow active domain. The strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers with the large variation of the critical magnetic Reynolds number can be related to the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In contrast to the kinematic models, the nonlinear MHD simulations reveal a small scale dynamo solution with the magnetic energy remaining significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small.</description>

Abstract: The old G3V star Kepler-10 is known to host two transiting planets, the ultra-short-period super-Earth Kepler-10b ($P=0.837$ d; $R_{\rm p}=1.47~\rm R_\oplus$) and the long-period sub-Neptune Kepler-10c ($P=45.294$ d; $R_{\rm p}=2.35~\rm R_\oplus$), and a non-transiting planet that causes variations in the Kepler-10c transit times. Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the literature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset and/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost 300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\sim11$~years, and extracted with the YARARA-v2 tool, which corrects for possible systematics and/or low-level activity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we used three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all converged to the solution: $M_{\rm p, b}=3.24 \pm 0.32~\rm M_\oplus$ (10$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=5.54 \pm 0.64~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b; $M_{\rm p, c}=11.29 \pm 1.24~\rm M_\oplus$ (9$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=4.75 \pm 0.53~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\rm p, d}\sin{i}=12.00 \pm 2.15~\rm M_\oplus$ (6$\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \pm 0.48$ d for the non-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the analysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous modeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities. While Kepler-10b is consistent with a rocky composition and a small or no iron core, Kepler-10c may be a water world that formed beyond the water snowline and subsequently migrated inward.</description>
