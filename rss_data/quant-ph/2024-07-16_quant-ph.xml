      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev approximation and composition of functions in matrix product states for quantum-inspired numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the representation of univariate and multivariate functions as matrix product states (MPS), also known as quantized tensor-trains (QTT). It proposes an algorithm that employs iterative Chebyshev expansions and Clenshaw evaluations to represent analytic and highly differentiable functions as MPS Chebyshev interpolants. It demonstrates rapid convergence for highly-differentiable functions, aligning with theoretical predictions, and generalizes efficiently to multidimensional scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is compared with that of tensor cross-interpolation (TCI) and multiscale interpolative constructions through a comprehensive comparative study. When function evaluation is inexpensive or when the function is not analytical, TCI is generally more efficient for function loading. However, the proposed method shows competitive performance, outperforming TCI in certain multivariate scenarios. Moreover, it shows advantageous scaling rates and generalizes to a wider range of tasks by providing a framework for function composition in MPS, which is useful for non-linear problems and many-body statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Dressing trapped ions with integrated wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss dressing trapped ions with the near field of a trap integrated wire. Ramping a dressing field on/off adiabatically before/after an operation changes its effective Hamiltonian. The amplitude and detuning of the dressing field act as tunable degrees of freedom we can use to `customize' the properties of any operation. We propose three use cases for this general tool. First, we can generate `artificial' clock states, where we eliminate the (assumed to be small) linear sensitivity of a qubit. Second, we can break the degeneracies that often complicate shelving at low quantization fields\textemdash allowing us to implement operations with linearly polarized microwaves that would, otherwise, require circular polarization. Finally, we can implement laser-free single qubit gates on a set of `target' ions using fields that are separated from the rest of the computer in frequency space.</description>

      <title>Noncontextuality inequalities for prepare-transform-measure scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first systematic technique for deriving witnesses of contextuality in prepare-transform-measure scenarios. More specifically, we show how linear quantifier elimination can be used to compute a polytope of correlations consistent with generalized noncontextuality in such scenarios. This polytope is specified as a set of noncontextuality inequalities that are necessary and sufficient conditions for observed data in the scenario to admit of a classical explanation relative to any linear operational identities, if one ignores some constraints from diagram preservation. While including these latter constraints generally leads to tighter inequalities, it seems that nonlinear quantifier elimination would be required to systematically include them. We also provide a linear program which can certify the nonclassicality of a set of numerical data arising in a prepare-transform-measure experiment. We apply our results to get a robust noncontextuality inequality for transformations that can be violated within the stabilizer subtheory. Finally, we give a simple algorithm for computing all the linear operational identities holding among a given set of states, of transformations, or of measurements.</description>

      <title>Dissipative variational quantum algorithms for Gibbs state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention due to their adaptability and efficiency on near-term quantum hardware. They have shown potential in a variety of tasks, including linear algebra, search problems, Gibbs and ground state preparation. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in current day quantum hardware, severely limits their performance. In this work, we introduce dissipative variational quantum algorithms (D-VQAs) by incorporating dissipative operations, such as qubit RESET and stochastic gates, as an intrinsic part of a variational quantum circuit. We argue that such dissipative variational algorithms posses some natural resilience to dissipative noise. We demonstrate how such algorithms can prepare Gibbs states over a wide range of quantum many-body Hamiltonians and temperatures, while significantly reducing errors due to both coherent and non-coherent noise. An additional advantage of our approach is that no ancilla qubits are need. Our results highlight the potential of D-VQAs to enhance the robustness and accuracy of variational quantum computations on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Permutation Superposition Oracles for Quantum Query Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of Zhandry's compressed oracle method to random permutations, where an algorithm can query both the permutation and its inverse. We show how to use the resulting oracle simulation to bound the success probability of an algorithm for any predicate on input-output pairs, a key feature of Zhandry's technique that had hitherto resisted attempts at generalization to random permutations. One key technical ingredient is to use strictly monotone factorizations to represent the permutation in the oracle's database. As an application of our framework, we show that the one-round sponge construction is unconditionally preimage resistant in the random permutation model. This proves a conjecture by Unruh.</description>

      <title>DisQ: A Markov Decision Process Based Language for Quantum Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum computers has reached a great milestone, in spite of restrictions on important quantum resources: the number of qubits being entangled at a single-location quantum computer. Recently, there has been some work to combine single-location quantum computing and quantum networking techniques to develop distributed quantum systems such that large entangled qubit groups can be established through remote processors, and quantum algorithms can be executed distributively. We present DisQ as a framework to facilitate the rewrites of quantum algorithms to their distributed versions. The core of DisQ is a distributed quantum programming language that combines the concepts of Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM) and Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with the objective of providing a clearly distinguishing quantum concurrent and distributed behaviors. Based on the DisQ language, we develop a simulation relation for verifying the equivalence of a quantum algorithm and its distributed versions. We present several case studies, such as quantum addition and Shor's algorithm, to demonstrate their equivalent rewrites to distributed versions.</description>

      <title>The Casimir-Lifshitz Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Casimir-Lifshitz effect associated with the electromagnetic field in the presence of a rectangular waveguide consisting of two distinct dielectric materials in a (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime. We employ the surface mode technique to derive a generalized Lifshitz formula for this specific geometry. Our formulation accounts for the unique dielectric properties of the materials composing the waveguide, leading to a precise calculation of the Casimir-Lifshitz energy. In the asymptotic limit, our results recover the classical expressions for perfect reflecting boundaries. The behavior of the force on the rectangular cavity walls admit us to identify the system as a Casimir-Lifshitz anharmonic oscillator, that may vibrate due only the to vacuum stress if we allow two parallel non-fixed walls.</description>

      <title>Superradiance from Nitrogen Vacancy Centers Coupled to An Ultranarrow Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been successfully coupled to various optical structures to enhance their radiation by the Purcell effect. The participation of many NV centers in these studies may naturally lead to cooperative emission and superradiance, and our recent experimental study with a diamond membrane in a fiber-based ultra-narrow optical cavity demonstrated nonlinear radiation power and fast photon bunching which are signatures of such collective effects. In this theoretical article, we go beyond the simple model used in the previous study to address more phenomena, such as the appearance of bunching shoulders in the second-order correlation function, Rabi splitting in the steady-state spectrum, and population dynamics on excited Dicke states, which for moderate pumping explains the observed collective effects. Overall, our results can guide further experiments with NV centers, and they are also relevant for other solid-state color centers, such as silicon-vacancy centers in diamond and silicon carbide, boron-vacancy centers and carbon-related centers in hexagonal boron-nitride.</description>

      <title>Scheme for measuring topological transitions in a continuous variable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for measuring topological properties in a two-photon-driven Kerr-nonlinear resonator (KNR) subjected to a single-photon modulation. The topological properties are revealed through the observation of the Berry curvature and hence the first Chern number, as a nonadiabatic response of the physical observable to the change rate of the control parameter of the modulated drive. The parameter manifold, constructed from the system's Hamiltonian that determines its dynamics constrained in the state space spanned by the even and odd cat states as two basis states, is adjusted so that the degeneracy crossing the manifold indicates a topological transition. The scheme, with such continuous variable states in mesoscpic systems, provides a new perspective for exploration of the geometry and the related topology with complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beam Splitter as a Quantum Coherence Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum beam splitter (QBS) with tunable reflection and transmission coefficients. More importantly, our device based on a Hermitian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system enables the generation and manipulation of asymmetric quantum coherence of the output photons. For the interference of two weak coherent-state inputs, our QBS can produce anti-bunched photons from one output port and bunched photons from the other, showcasing high parity asymmetry and strong coherence control capabilities. Beyond the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, perfect photon blockade with vanishing $g^{(2)}(0)$ is achievable in two-photon interference. These striking effects of the QBS fundamentally arise from the parity-symmetry-breaking interaction and the quantum interference between the photon scattering channels. Our results could inspire novel applications and the development of innovative photonic devices for the manipulation of weak quantum light.</description>

      <title>Chaos, entanglement and Husimi Q function in quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the famous effects in quantum Rabi model (QRM), Rabi oscillation may lead to the occurrence of quantum dynamics behaviors without classical dynamic counterparts, such as quantum collapse and revival effects. In this paper, we focus on studying whether the entanglement entropy and Husimi Q function, as diagnostic tools for quantum chaos in quantum systems, are invalidated by quantum collapse and revival. It is shown that the saturation values of entanglement entropy for initial states located in the chaotic sea of QRM are higher than that in the regular regions. When the system reaches dynamic equilibrium, the Husimi Q function which initial states located in the chaotic sea are more dispersed than that in the regular regions. Moreover, we observe a good correspondence between the the time-average entanglement entropy and classical phase space structures. Our results imply that entanglement entropy and Husimi Q function maintain the function for diagnosing chaos in the QRM and the corresponding principle does not be invalidated by quantum collapse and revival effects in this system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vicsek Model for Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum analog of the Vicsek model, consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a uniformly polarized magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. We derive the hydrodynamic equations, similar to those formulated by Toner and Tu, by applying a mean-field approximation to the quantum analog model up to the next leading order. Our investigation not only establishes a microscopic connection between the Vicsek model and the Toner-Tu hydrodynamics for active matter, but also aims to inspire further studies of active matter in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Model-free Distortion Canceling and Control of Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices need precise control to achieve their full capability. In this work, we address the problem of controlling closed quantum systems, tackling two main issues. First, in practice the control signals are usually subject to unknown classical distortions that could arise from the device fabrication, material properties and/or instruments generating those signals. Second, in most cases modeling the system is very difficult or not even viable due to uncertainties in the relations between some variables and inaccessibility to some measurements inside the system. In this paper, we introduce a general model-free control approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), that can work for any closed quantum system. We train a deep neural network (NN), using the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm to control the state probability distribution of a closed quantum system as it evolves, and drive it to different target distributions. We present a novel controller architecture that comprises multiple NNs. This enables accommodating as many different target state distributions as desired, without increasing the complexity of the NN or its training process. The used DRL algorithm works whether the control problem can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) or a partially observed MDP. Our method is valid whether the control signals are discrete- or continuous-valued. We verified our method through numerical simulations based on a photonic waveguide array chip. We trained a controller to generate sequences of different target output distributions of the chip with fidelity higher than 99%, where the controller showed superior performance in canceling the classical signal distortions.</description>

      <title>Probability and fidelity of teleportation in a two-mode continuous variable cluster state via an insufficiently selective measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable projective measurements can not select individual measurement results as in the discrete case; instead, the possible outcomes are bounded by the selectivity interval of the measurement; then, it is say that continuous-variable measurement devices are insufficiently selective. By utilizing this concept we show that the probability and fidelity of teleportation in a two-mode cluster state can be handled by the localization of the selectivity interval of the measurement apparatus. Besides, we provide a mathematical expression describing the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes in the two-mode cluster, which is a fundamental solution of the heat equation. In addition, we show that the fidelity of teleportation in the two mode cluster is given by the quotient between the squared solution of a non-homogeneous heat equation and the solution of the conventional heat equation. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a configuration involving successive clusters with intermediate corrections between each teleportation step. To exemplify our proposal, we consider the specific case of a squeezed-coherent state as the quantum state under teleportation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Clock Synchronization Network with Silicon-chip Dual-Pumped Entangled Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum clock synchronization (QCS) network scheme with silicon-chip dual-pumped entangled photon source. This scheme couples two pump beams into the silicon-based waveguide, where degenerate and non-degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) occurs, generating entanglement between one signal channel and three idler channels. The entangled photons are distributed to remote users through the wavelength division multiplexing strategy to construct an entanglement distribution network, and the round-trip QCS is adopted to realize a QCS network that can serve multiple users. A proof-of-principle QCS network experiment is implemented among the server and multiple users (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) for 11.1 hours, where Alice and Charlie are 10 km away from the server and Bob is 25 km away from the server. The lowest time deviations (TDEV) between the server and each user (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) are 1.57 ps, 0.82 ps and 2.57 ps at the average time of 8000 s, 8000 s and 800 s respectively. The results show that the QCS network scheme with dual-pumped SFWM photon source proposed by us achieves high accuracy, and the channel resources used by n users are reduced by about 30% compared with other round-trip QCS schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce deterministic benchmarking (DB), a protocol designed to identify the interplay of coherent and incoherent errors overlooked by randomized benchmarking (RB) and related benchmarking methods. DB provides a set of four parameters that characterize both incoherent and coherent errors in the single-qubit gate set. Furthermore, DB reveals asymmetries in gate performance induced by strong relaxation errors ($T_1$). We experimentally demonstrate DB using a superconducting transmon qubit and support these results with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations. Our findings uncover critical errors missed by conventional RB and point to strategies to mitigate these errors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of multi-qubit states representing directed networks and its detection with quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum graph states that can be mapped to directed weighted graphs, also known as directed networks. The geometric measure of entanglement of the states is calculated for the quantum graph states corresponding to arbitrary graphs. We find relationships between the entanglement and the properties of the corresponding graphs. Namely, we obtain that the geometric measure of entanglement of a qubit with other qubits in the graph state is related to the weights of ingoing and outgoing arcs with respect to the vertex representing the qubit, outdegree and indegree of the corresponding vertex in the graph. For unweighted and undirected graphs, the entanglement depends on the degree of the corresponding vertex. Quantum protocol for quantifying of the entanglement of the quantum graph states is constructed. As an example, a quantum graph state corresponding to a chain is examined, and the entanglement of the state is calculated on AerSimulator.</description>

      <title>Practicality of quantum adiabatic algorithm for chemistry applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its simplicity and strong theoretical guarantees, adiabatic state preparation has received considerably less interest than variational approaches for the preparation of low-energy electronic structure states. Two major reasons for this are the large number of gates required for Trotterising time-dependent electronic structure Hamiltonians, as well as discretisation errors heating the state. We show that a recently proposed randomized algorithm, which implements exact adiabatic evolution without heating and with far fewer gates than Trotterisation, can overcome this problem. We develop three methods for measuring the energy of the prepared state in an efficient and noise-resilient manner, yielding chemically accurate results on a 4-qubit molecule in the presence of realistic gate noise, without the need for error mitigation. These findings suggest that adiabatic approaches to state preparation could play a key role in quantum chemistry simulations both in the era of noisy as well as error-corrected quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Finite Classical and Quantum Effect Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we only consider finite effect algebras. We define the concepts of classical and quantum effect algebras and show that an effect algebra $E$ is classical if and only if there exists an observable that measures every effect of $E$. We next consider matrix representations of effect algebras and prove an effect algebra is classical if and only if its matrix representation has precisely one row. We then discuss sum table for effect algebras. Although these are not as concise as matrix representations, they give more immediate information about effect sums which are the basic operations of an effect algebra. We subsequently study states on effect algebras and prove that classical effect algebras are quantum effect algebras. Finally, we consider composites of effect algebras. This allows us to study interacting systems described by effect algebras. We show that two effect algebras are classical if and only if their composite is classical. We point out that scale effect algebras are not the only classical effect algebras and stress the importance of atoms in this work.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density Modulation and Universal Markovian Closure of Fermionic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of chain-mapping and tensor-network techniques provides a powerful tool for the numerically exact simulation of open quantum systems interacting with structured environments. However, these methods suffer from a quadratic scaling with the physical simulation time, and therefore they become challenging in the presence of multiple environments. This is particularly true when fermionic environments, well-known to be highly correlated, are considered. In this work we first illustrate how a thermo-chemical modulation of the spectral density allows replacing the original fermionic environments with equivalent, but simpler, ones. Moreover, we show how this procedure reduces the number of chains needed to model multiple environments. We then provide a derivation of the fermionic Markovian closure construction, consisting of a small collection of damped fermionic modes undergoing a Lindblad-type dynamics and mimicking a continuum of bath modes. We describe, in particular, how the use of the Markovian closure allows for a polynomial reduction of the time complexity of chain-mapping based algorithms when long-time dynamics are needed.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Automatic Tool for Finding Impossible Differentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the superiority of quantum computing, traditional cryptography is facing severe threat. This makes the security evaluation of cryptographic systems in quantum attack models significant and urgent. For symmetric ciphers, the security analysis heavily relies on cyptanalytic tools. Thus exploring the use of quantum algorithms to traditional cyptanalytic tools has drawn a lot of attention. In this study, we utilize quantum algorithms to improve impossible differential attack, and design two quantum automatic tools for searching impossible differentials. The proposed quantum algorithms exploit the idea of miss-in-the-middle and the properties of truncated differentials. We rigorously prove their validity and calculate the quantum resources required to implement them. Compared to existing classical automatic cryptanalysis, the quantum tools proposed have the advantage of accurately characterizing S-boxes while only requiring polynomial complexity, and can take into consideration the impact of the key schedules in single-key model.</description>

      <title>Progress and Perspectives on Weak-value Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a metrological protocol that effectively amplifies ultra-small physical effects, making it highly applicable in the fields of quantum sensing and metrology. However, the amplification effect is achieved through post-selection, which leads to a significant decrease in signal intensity. Consequently, there is a heated debate regarding the trade-off between the amplification effect and the success probability of post-selection, questioning whether WVA surpasses conventional measurement (CM) in terms of measurement precision. Extensive research indicates that the specific theoretical assumptions and experimental conditions play crucial roles in determining the respective advantages of WVA and CM. WVA provides new perspectives for recognizing the important role of post-selection in precision metrology. It demonstrates significant advantages in two aspects: (i) WVA based on the phase space interaction provides feasible strategies to practically achieve the Heisenberg-scaling precision using only classical resources. (ii) WVA exhibits robustness against certain types of technical noise and imperfections of detectors. Moreover, WVA allows for various modifications to extend the applicable scope and enhance the metrological performance in corresponding situations. Despite substantial progress in recent years, the inherent connection between the advantages of WVA and its unique features remains incompletely understood. In this paper, we systematically review the recent advances in the WVA scheme, with a particular focus on the ultimate precision of WVA under diverse conditions. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive perspective on the benefits of WVA in precision measurement and facilitate the realization of its full potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short review article, we present recent progress in quantum thermodynamics in the framework with a correlated catalyst. We examine two key properties of thermal operations, the Gibbs preserving property and the covariant property. The state convertibility of a Gibbs preserving operation is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics with the nonequilibrium free energy. The state convertibility of a covariant operation is shown to be free as long as an initial state has finite coherence. We finally show that these two findings can be combined in the enhanced thermal operation (covariant Gibbs-preserving operation).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a quantum hashing algorithm which is based on a fingerprinting technique presented by Ambainis and Frievalds, 1988, on gate-based quantum computers. This algorithm is based on a quantum finite automaton for a unary language $\mathtt{MOD_p}$, where $ \mathtt{MOD_p} = \{ a^{i \cdot p} \mid i \geq 0 \} $, for any prime number $p$. We consider 16-qubit and 27-qubit IBMQ computers with the special graphs of qubits representing nearest neighbor architecture that is not Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) one. We optimize quantum circuits for the quantum hashing algorithm with respect to minimizing the number of control operators as the most expensive ones. We apply the same approach for an optimized circuit implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) operation on the aforementioned machines because QFT and hashing circuits have common parts.</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor network simulation of multi-emitter non-Markovian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method to simulate a system of multiple emitters coupled to a non-interacting bath, in any parameter regime. Our method relies on a Block Lanczos transformation that maps the whole system onto a strip geometry, whose width is given by the number of emitters. Utilizing the spatial symmetries of the problem and identifying the relevant range of energies of the bath we achieve a more efficient simulation, which we perform using tensor network techniques. As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from multiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the departure from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is increased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic preparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multi-excitation initial state. Our work opens new possibilities for the systematic exploration of non-Markovian effects in the dynamics and equilibrium properties of multi-emitter systems. Furthermore, it can easily be extended to other setups, including finite bath temperature or impurities coupled to fermionic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose several methods for optimizing the number of qubits in a quantum circuit while preserving the number of non-Clifford gates. One of our approaches consists in reversing, as much as possible, the gadgetization of Hadamard gates, which is a procedure used by some $T$-count optimizers to circumvent Hadamard gates at the expense of additional qubits. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and we present an algorithm for solving it. We also propose a more general approach to optimize the number of qubits by showing how it relates to the problem of finding a minimal-width path-decomposition of the graph associated with a given ZX-diagram. This approach can be used to optimize the number of qubits for any computational model that can natively be depicted in ZX-calculus, such as the Pauli Fusion computational model which can represent lattice surgery operations. We also show how this method can be used to efficiently optimize the number of qubits in a quantum circuit by using the ZX-calculus as an intermediate representation.</description>

      <title>Parallel Ising Annealer via Gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising annealer is a promising quantum-inspired computing architecture for combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an Ising annealer based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which updates the variables of all dimensions in parallel. The main innovation is the fusion of an approximate gradient-based approach into the Ising annealer which introduces significant acceleration and allows a portable and scalable implementation on the commercial FPGA. Comprehensive simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed Ising annealer has promising performance and scalability on all types of benchmark problems when compared to other Ising annealers including the state-of-the-art hardware. In particular, we have built a prototype annealer which solves Ising problems of both integer and fraction coefficients with up to 200 spins on a single low-cost FPGA board, whose performance is demonstrated to be better than the state-of-the-art quantum hardware D-Wave 2000Q and similar to the expensive coherent Ising machine. The sub-linear scalability of the annealer signifies its potential in solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems and evaluating the advantage of quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon triplet generation based on third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion remains as an experimental challenge. The challenge stems from the trade-offs between source brightness and instrument noise. This work presents a probability theory of coincidence detection to address the detection limit in source characterization. We use Bayes' theorem to model instruments as a noisy communication channel and apply statistical inference to identify the minimum detectable coincidence rate. A triplet generation rate of 1-100 Hz is required for source characterization performed over 1-72 hours using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic quantum error-correcting code, the quantum-information structure hypothesized for the AdS/CFT correspondence, has being attracting increasing attention in new directions interrelating the studies of quantum gravity and quantum simulation. In this work, we initiate a novel approach for building holographic code that can be generally applied in potentially broad and interdisciplinary contexts. Our approach takes an "opposite" route to the conventional paradigm that is based on bulk tensor-networks. As illustrated in an exact model, we start from scalable descriptions of boundary qudits which can guide succinct quantum-circuit simulations, and rigorously show how the bulk qudits and the encoding structure emerge from boundary entanglement patterns. By investigating the entanglement patterns, we systematically unfold the hypothetical structure for bulk reconstruction and the details of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the formalism of operator-algebra quantum error correction, demonstrating desired properties that are not yet proved in the established models. Our work might offer a fresh perspective for the study of holographic code.</description>

Abstract: We present the generalization of the CNC formalism, based on closed and noncontextual sets of Pauli observables, to the setting of odd-prime-dimensional qudits. By introducing new CNC-type phase space point operators, we construct a quasiprobability representation for quantum computation which is covariant with respect to the Clifford group and positivity preserving under Pauli measurements, and whose nonnegative sector strictly contains the subtheory of quantum theory described by nonnegative Wigner functions. This allows for a broader class of magic state quantum circuits to be efficiently classically simulated than those covered by the stabilizer formalism and Wigner function methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty principle forbids one to determine which of the two paths a quantum system has travelled, unless interference between the alternatives had been destroyed by a measuring device, e.g., by a pointer. One can try to weaken the coupling between the device and the system, in order to avoid the veto. We demonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate one, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual trial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a classical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Instruction Set Architectures, Abstract Machine Models, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.</description>

Abstract: We aim to establish a scalable scheme for characterising diagonal non- Clifford gates for single- and multi-quit systems; d is a prime-power integer. By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the dihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results establish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of theoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as it does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to characterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised benchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a universal gate set.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising and widely used algorithms for exploiting the capabilities of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, VQE algorithms suffer from a plethora of issues, such as barren plateaus, local minima, quantum hardware noise, and limited qubit connectivity, thus posing challenges for their successful deployment on hardware and simulators. In this work, we propose a VQE optimization strategy that builds upon recent advances in the literature, and exhibits very shallow circuit depths when applied to the specific system of interest, namely a model Hamiltonian representing a cuprate superconductor. These features make our approach a favorable candidate for generating good ground state approximations on current NISQ devices. Our findings illustrate the potential of VQE algorithmic development for leveraging the full capabilities of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the Hermitian matrix space and the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the Schrieffer--Wolff (SW) transformation (also called quasi-degenerate perturbation theory) is known as an approximative method to reduce the dimension of the Hamiltonian. We present a geometric interpretation of the SW transformation: We prove that it induces a local coordinate chart in the space of Hermitian matrices near a $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold. Inspired by this result, we establish a `distance theorem': we show that the standard deviation of $k$ neighboring eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian equals the distance of this Hamiltonian from the corresponding $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold, divided by $\sqrt{k}$. Furthermore, we investigate one-parameter perturbations of a degenerate Hamiltonian, and prove that the standard deviation and the pairwise differences of the eigenvalues lead to the same order of splitting of the energy eigenvalues, which in turn is the same as the order of distancing from the degeneracy submanifold. As applications, we prove the `protection' of Weyl points using the transversality theorem, and infer geometrical properties of certain degeneracy submanifolds based on results from quantum error correction and topological order.</description>

      <title>Superresolution in separation estimation between two dynamic incoherent sources using spatial demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving resolution in the sub-Rayleigh regime (superresolution) is one of the rapidly developing topics in quantum optics and metrology. Recently, it was shown that perfect measurement based on spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) in Hermite-Gauss modes allows one to reach the quantum limit of precision for estimation of separation between two weak incoherent stationary sources. Since then, different imperfections such as misalignment or crosstalk between modes have been studied to check how this result translates into more realistic experimental setups. In this paper, we consider another deviation from the perfect setup by discarding the assumption about the stationarity of the sources. This is relevant for example for astrophysical applications where planets necessarily orbit around the star. We analyze two examples of dynamics: rotations and oscillations, showing the robustness of the SPADE-based measurement against them. The analysis is based on Fisher information, which allows one to obtain the precision limit through Cram\'er-Rao bound. Furthermore, we formulate a measurement algorithm that allows for the reduction of one parameter for estimation (system orientation angle) in the stationary sources scenario, maintaining the measurement precision despite the lack of knowledge about this parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore monolithic opto-electronic integration platform for significant down-scaling of input-referred noise in custom designed low-noise analog front-end used for balanced photodetection. The performance of such monolithically integrated approach is compared to heterogeneously integrated solution designed in the same technology which requires wire-bonding to the balanced photodetectors. The designed circuits are targeting bandwidth above 1 GHz. The improved noise performance is leveraged against increased secure key rates and achievable reach in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Matrix Product State Ansatz with Tests on Transcorrelated Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\rm H_2$, $\rm H_4$, and $\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions, Caustics, and Quantum Dark Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in quantum systems by showing their connection to caustics forming in the Fock space representation of the many-body state over time. In this way we find an explanation for DPTs in a quantum spin system in terms of an everyday natural phenomenon: The dark band between the primary and seconday bows (caustics) in rainbows (Alexander's dark band). The DPT occurs when the Loschmidt echo crosses the switching line between the evanescent tails of two back-to-back Airy functions that dress neighbouring fold caustics in Fock space and is the time-dependent analogue of what is seen as a function of angle in the sky. The structural stability and universal properties of caustics, as described mathematically by catastrophe theory, suggests our analysis has wide applicability. Based on our thorough analytical understanding we propose a protocol which can be used to verify the existence of a DPT in a finite system experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives, whereas they can be still used as a starting methods of recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation.</description>

      <title>Encoded probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a trapped-ion quantum computer for ground and excited states of spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Analyzing negativity criterion in qubit-qutrit system located in external magnetic fields with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the intricate entanglement dynamics exhibited by qubit-qutrit systems when subjected to the intricate dynamics of both the XXX isotropic Heisenberg model and the anisotropic XYZ model. These models are enriched by the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions and external magnetic fields, creating a complex interplay of quantum phenomena. The exploration commences by initializing the system in a superposition of spin-coherent states, setting the stage for a nuanced analysis of entanglement evolution over time. By employing the negativity metric as the pivotal criterion for assessing entanglement, we gain insights into the subtle relationships between DM interactions, external magnetic fields, and the entanglement dynamics within this composite system. Through this comprehensive investigation, we aim to unravel the intricate dynamics and behaviors that emerge from the interplay of these fundamental elements, shedding light on the underlying principles governing quantum entanglement in this context.</description>

      <title>Spatial Addressing of Qubits in a Dispersive Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics, the study of atomic systems interacting with propagating electromagnetic fields, is a powerful platform for understanding the complex interplay between light and matter. Qubit control is an indispensable tool in this field, and most experiments have so far focused on narrowband electromagnetic waves that interact with qubits at specific frequencies. This interaction, however, changes significantly with fast, broadband pulses, as waveguide properties like dispersion affect the pulse evolution and its impact on the qubit. Here, we use dispersion to achieve spatial addressing of superconducting qubits separated by a sub-wavelength distance within a microwave waveguide. This novel approach relies on a self-focusing effect to create a position-dependent interaction between the pulse and the qubits. This experiment emphasizes the importance of dispersion in the design and analysis of quantum experiments, and offers new avenues for the rapid control of quantum states.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al.~[JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt~[ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

      <title>Capturing non-Markovian polaron dressing with the master equation formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems in strong coupling and non-Markovian regimes remains a formidable theoretical challenge. One popular and well-established method of approximation in these circumstances is provided by the polaron master equation (PME). In this work we reevaluate and extend the validity of the PME to capture the impact of non-Markovian polaron dressing, induced by non-equilibrium open system dynamics. By comparing with numerically exact techniques, we confirm that while the standard PME successfully predicts the dynamics of system observables that commute with the polaron transformation (e.g. populations in the Pauli z-basis), it can struggle to fully capture those that do not (e.g. coherences). This limitation stems from the mixing of system and environment degrees of freedom inherent to the polaron transformation, which affects the accuracy of calculated expectation values within the polaron frame. Employing the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism, we introduce correction terms that provide an accurate description of observables that do not commute with the transformation. We demonstrate the significance of the correction terms in two cases, the canonical spin-boson model and a dissipative time-dependent Landau-Zener protocol, where they are shown to impact the system dynamics on both short and long timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm solves the unstructured search problem. Grover's algorithm can find the target item with certainty only if searching one out of four. Grover's algorithm can be deterministic if the phase of the oracle or the diffusion operator is delicately designed. The precision of the phases could be a problem. We propose a near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without the phase control. Our algorithm has the same oracle and diffusion operators as Grover's algorithm. One additional component is the rescaled diffusion operator. It acts partially on the database. We show how to improve the success probability of Grover's algorithm by the partial diffusion operator in two different ways. The possible cost is one or two more queries to the oracle. We also design the deterministic search algorithm when searching one out of eight, sixteen, and thirty-two.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Centers in the Presence of Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Data Centers (QDCs) could overcome the scalability challenges of modern quantum computers. Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are affected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the number of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of computational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on any one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU can be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to the latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement distribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of noise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the robustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm and TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU entangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a quantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation during distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation opportunity for compilation.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Surface Codes in Compensating for Radiation Events in Superconducting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability is fundamental for developing large-scale quantum computers. Since the benefit of technological advancements to the qubit's stability is saturating, algorithmic solutions, such as quantum error correction (QEC) codes, are needed to bridge the gap to reliable computation. Unfortunately, the deployment of the first quantum computers has identified faults induced by natural radiation as an additional threat to qubits reliability. The high sensitivity of qubits to radiation hinders the large-scale adoption of quantum computers, since the persistence and area-of-effect of the fault can potentially undermine the efficacy of the most advanced QEC.
  In this paper, we investigate the resilience of various implementations of state-of-the-art QEC codes to radiation-induced faults. We report data from over 400 million fault injections and correlate hardware faults with the logical error observed after decoding the code output, extrapolating physical-to-logical error rates. We compare the code's radiation-induced logical error rate over the code distance, the number and role in the QEC of physical qubits, the underlying quantum computer topology, and particle energy spread in the chip. We show that, by simply selecting and tuning properly the surface code, thus without introducing any overhead, the probability of correcting a radiation-induced fault is increased by up to 10\%. Finally, we provide indications and guidelines for the design of future QEC codes to further increase their effectiveness against radiation-induced events.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum measurement that probabilistically projects a pair of qudits of dimension $d$ onto a Bell state in a two-qubit subspace. It can be performed using linear-optical circuits with the success probabilities of $1-d^{-1}$ without ancilla photons and $1-d^{-(k+1)}$ with $2(2^{k}-1)$ ancilla photons. It allows us to entangle two independently-prepared high-dimensional entangled states two-dimensionally with higher probabilities than ones of linear-optical fusion gates on qubits. As an application, we propose a fast quantum repeater protocol with three-qudit GHZ states and quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the readout of a superconducting qubit for repeated measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Readout of superconducting qubits faces a trade-off between measurement speed and unwanted back-action on the qubit caused by the readout drive, such as $T_1$ degradation and leakage out of the computational subspace. The readout is typically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary threshold to extract the "readout fidelity". We show that such a characterization may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. We introduce a method to quantitatively assess this error by repeatedly executing a composite operation -- a readout preceded by a randomized qubit-flip. We apply this technique to characterize the dispersive readout of an intrinsically Purcell-protected qubit. We report a binary readout fidelity of $99.63\%$ and quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity exceeding $99.00\%$ which takes into account a leakage error rate of $0.12\pm0.03\%$, under a repetition rate of $(380 \rm{ns})^{-1}$ for the composite operation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control of an Oscillator with a Kerr-cat Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient strategy for quantum error correction by redundantly encoding quantum information in the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. However, experimental realizations of these codes are often limited by ancilla errors propagating to the encoded logical qubit during syndrome measurements. The Kerr-cat qubit has been proposed as an ancilla for these codes due to its theoretically-exponential noise bias, which would enable fault-tolerant error syndrome measurements, but the coupling required to perform these syndrome measurements has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we experimentally realize driven parametric coupling of a Kerr-cat qubit to a high-quality-factor microwave cavity and demonstrate a gate set enabling universal quantum control of the cavity. We measure the decoherence of the cavity in the presence of the Kerr-cat and discover excess dephasing due to heating of the Kerr-cat to excited states. By engineering frequency-selective dissipation to counteract this heating, we are able to eliminate this dephasing, thereby demonstrating a high on-off ratio of control. Our results pave the way toward using the Kerr-cat to fault-tolerantly measure error syndromes of bosonic codes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Computers: Towards a Standard Performance Evaluation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technological development of increasingly larger quantum processors on different quantum platforms raises the problem of how to fairly compare their performance, known as quantum benchmarking of quantum processors. This is a challenge that computer scientists have already faced when comparing classical processors, leading to the development of various mathematical tools to address it, but also to the identification of the limits of this problem. In this work, we briefly review the most important aspects of both classical processor benchmarks and the metrics comprising them, providing precise definitions and analyzing the quality attributes that they should exhibit. Subsequently, we analyze the intrinsic properties that characterize the paradigm of quantum computing and hinder the naive transfer of strategies from classical benchmarking. However, we can still leverage some of the lessons learned such as the quality attributes of a \textit{good} benchmark. Additionally, we review some of the most important metrics and benchmarks for quantum processors proposed in the literature, assessing what quality attributes they fulfill. Finally, we propose general guidelines for quantum benchmarking. These guidelines aim to pave the way for establishing a roadmap towards standardizing the performance evaluation of quantum devices, ultimately leading to the creation of an organization akin to the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric setup where each photon returns one bit of the binary expansion of an unknown phase. It sets up a method for estimating the phase value at arbitrary uncertainty. This strategy is global, since it requires no prior information, and it achieves the Heisenberg bound independently of the output statistics. We provide simulations and a characterization of this architecture.</description>

      <title>A Causal Model for Quantifying Multipartite Classical and Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16414v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation. Subsequently, we present a novel quantum secrecy monotone and investigate a quantum hybrid key distribution system as an extension of our causal model. Finally, we discuss some connections to optimal transport (OT) problem.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Photovoltaic Cells Efficiency to Initial Conditions in Various Aggregation Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is thought that nature already exploits quantum mechanical properties to increase the efficiency of solar energy harvesting devices. So, the operation of these devices can be enhanced by clever design of a nanoscopic, quantum mechanical system where the quantum coherence plays a crucial role in this process. In this investigation, we develop a donor-acceptor two-level trap dipole model converging the key role of quantum coherence and aggregation effects along with different initial states. Our analysis reveals that quenching unwanted emissions is achievable by preparing the system in specific initial state under the effect of optimal spatial aggregation. Interestingly it is observed that characterizing aggregation-induced properties and quantum effects of bandgap engineering can increase the power enhancement up to 35.87% compared with classical counterparts. This encouraging trend suggests a promising novel design aspect of nature-mimicking photovoltaic devices.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a compressible spin liquid with low-energy density of states dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states of Majorana fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently been proposed as a quantum probe of chaos. The Krylov exponent characterising the exponential growth of Krylov complexity is conjectured to upper-bound the Lyapunov exponent. We compute the Krylov and the Lyapunov exponents in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and in some of its deformations. We do this analysis both at infinite and finite temperatures, in models where the number of fermionic interactions is both finite and infinite. We consider deformations that interpolate between two regions of near-maximal chaos and deformations that become nearly-integrable at low temperatures. In all cases, we find that the Krylov exponent upper-bounds the Lyapunov one. However, we find that while the Lyapunov exponent can have non-monotonic behaviour as a function of temperature, in all studied examples the Krylov exponent behaves monotonically. For instance, we find models where the Lyapunov exponent goes to zero at low temperatures, while the Krylov exponent saturates to its maximal bound. We speculate on the possibility that this monotonicity might be a generic feature of the Krylov exponent in quantum systems evolving under unitary evolution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the first version of GPU4PySCF, a module that provides GPU acceleration of methods in PySCF. As a core functionality, this provides a GPU implementation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) for contracted basis sets comprising up to g functions using Rys quadrature. As an illustration of how this can accelerate a quantum chemistry workflow, we describe how to use the ERIs efficiently in the integral-direct Hartree-Fock Fock build and nuclear gradient construction. Benchmark calculations show a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude with respect to the multi-threaded CPU Hartree-Fock code of PySCF, and performance comparable to other GPU-accelerated quantum chemical packages including GAMESS and QUICK on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Markov processes over discrete configurations, an asymptotic bound on the uncertainty of stochastic fluxes is derived in terms of the harmonic mean of decay rates with respect to the stationary distribution. This bound is necessarily tighter than the bound in terms of the arithmetic mean, i.e., the activity, known as the kinetic uncertainty relation. What is more, it can always be saturated. In turn, an exact limit for the uncertainty of first-passage times as well as the optimal long-time performance of stochastic clocks are established. The results generalise to semi-Markov processes, including quantum reset processes, where it can be determined when clock performance improves thanks to coherent driving.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Different Quantum Kernels on the Classification Performance of Support Vector Machine Algorithm: A Medical Dataset Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The support vector machine algorithm with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel), as a leading example of a quantum machine learning technique, has undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, its integration with classical data presents unique challenges. While quantum computers primarily interact with data in quantum states, embedding classical data into quantum states using feature mapping techniques is essential for leveraging quantum algorithms Despite the recognized importance of feature mapping, its specific impact on data classification outcomes remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by comprehensively assessing the effects of various feature mapping methods on classification results, taking medical data analysis as a case study. In this study, the QSVM-Kernel method was applied to classification problems in two different and publicly available medical datasets, namely, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Glioma datasets. In the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, quantum kernel matrices obtained from 9 different quantum feature maps were used. Thus, the effects of these quantum feature maps on the classification results of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm were examined in terms of both classifier performance and total execution time. As a result, in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) and TCGA Glioma datasets, when Rx and Ry rotational gates were used, respectively, as feature maps in the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, the best classification performances were achieved both in terms of classification performance and total execution time. The contributions of this study are that (1) it highlights the significant impact of feature mapping techniques on medical data classification outcomes using the QSVM-Kernel algorithm, and (2) it also guides undertaking research for improved QSVM classification performance.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to rigorously take into account the quantum nature of phase space which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models which are considered is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the grand canonical potential and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) involves a polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to hyperfine coupled nuclei and can increase the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by several orders of magnitude. The hyperfine coupling is considered to suppress nuclear dipolar flip-flop transitions, hindering the transport of nuclear hyperpolarization into the bulk (''spin-diffusion barrier''). Possible polarization-transfer pathways leading to DNP and subsequent spin diffusion between hypershifted nuclei in a two-electron two-nucleus four-spin system are investigated. The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applied to characterize transitions that are only possible as second-order effects. An energy-conserving electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop is identified, which combines an electron dipolar with a nuclear dipolar flip-flop process, describing spin diffusion close to electrons. The relevance of this process is supported by two-compartment model fits of HypRes-on experimental data. This suggests that all nuclear spins can contribute to the hyperpolarization of the bulk and the concept of a spin-diffusion barrier has to be reconsidered for samples with significant electron and nuclear dipolar couplings.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations (TURs) are relations that establish lower bounds for the relative fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in terms of the statistics of the associated entropy production. In this work we derive a family of TURs that explores higher order moments of the entropy production and is valid in any situation a Fluctuation Theorem holds. The resulting bound holds in both classical and quantum regimes and can always be saturated. These TURs are shown in action for a two level system weakly coupled to a bath undergoing a non time-symmetric drive, where we can use the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. Finally, we draw a connection between our TURs and the existence of correlations between the entropy production and the thermodynamic quantity under consideration.</description>

      <title>Imaging Coulomb interactions and migrating Dirac cones in twisted graphene by local quantum oscillations</title>

Abstract: Flat band moir\'e graphene systems have emerged as a quintessential platform to investigate correlated phases of matter. A plethora of interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, and yet despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between the various phases, in particular near charge neutrality point. Here, we use a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations in alternating-twist trilayer graphene at magnetic fields as low as 56 mT, which reveal ultrafine details of the density of states and of the renormalization of the single-particle band structure by Coulomb interactions. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states, is critical in explaining the high carrier density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe a Stoner-like symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. On approaching charge neutrality, where the charging energy is negligible and exchange energy is dominant, we find the ground state to be a nematic semimetal which is favored over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In the revealed semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone center, spontaneously breaking the C_3 rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillations technique presents an alluring avenue to explore the ground states of diverse strongly interacting van der Waals systems.</description>

Abstract: Topological magnetism has sparked an unprecedented age in quantum technologies. Marked by twisted spin structures with exotic dynamical modes, topological magnets have motivated a new generation of spintronic devices which transcend the limits of conventional semiconductor-based electronics. While existing material probes have biased studies and device conceptualizations for thin samples in two dimensions, advancements in three-dimensional probing techniques using beams of neutrons, are transforming our understanding of topological and emergent physics to reimagine spintronic devices. Here, we review recent neutron scattering breakthroughs which harness quantum degrees of freedom to enable three-dimensional topological investigations of quantum materials. We discuss applications of structured and tomographic neutron scattering techniques to topological magnets, with particular emphasis on magnetic skyrmion systems and their inspired three-dimensional logic device infrastructures through novel multi-bit encoding and control schemes. SANS-based dynamic visualizations and coherent manipulations of three-dimensional topological qubits are proposed using electric field controls of depth-dependant helicities and spin-orbit tuning of the neutron beam. Together, these investigations uncover a new world of three-dimensional topological physics which enhances spintronic devices through a novel set of structures, dynamics, and controls, unique to three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of order of transfer matrix exceptional points on transport at band edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that, in one dimensional fermionic systems, close to band edges, the zero temperature conductance scales as $1/N^2$, where $N$ is the system length. This universal subdiffusive scaling of conductance at band edges has been tied to an exceptional point (EP) of the transfer matrix of the system that occur at every band edge. Further, in presence of bulk dephasing probes, this EP has been shown to lead to a counterintuitive superballistic scaling of conductance, where the conductance increases with $N$ over a finite but large regime of system lengths. In this work, we explore how these behaviors are affected by the order of the transfer matrix EP at the band edge. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice chain with a finite range of hopping. Depending on the range of hopping and the hopping parameters, this system can feature band edges which correspond to arbitrarily higher order EPs of the associated transfer matrix. Using this system we establish in generality that, in absence of bulk dephasing, surprisingly, the universal $1/N^2$ scaling of conductance is completely unaffected by the order of the EP. This is despite the fact that existence of transfer matrix EP is crucial for such behavior. In presence of bulk dephasing, however, the phase coherence length, the extent of the superballisitic scaling regime and the exponent of superballistic scaling, all encode the order of the transfer matrix EP.</description>

      <title>General measurements with limited resources and their application to quantum unambiguous state discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we present a framework for implementing an arbitrary $n$-outcome generalized quantum measurement (POVM) on an $m$-qubit register as a sequence of two-outcome measurements requiring only single ancillary qubit. Our procedure offers a particular construction for the two-outcome partial measurements which can be composed into a full implementation of the measurement on any gate architecture. This implementation in general requires classical feedback; we present specific cases when this is not the case. We apply this framework on the unambiguous state discrimination and analyze possible strategies. In the simplest case, it gives the same construction as is known, if we opt for performing conclusiveness measurement first. However, it also offers possibility of performing measurement for one of the state outcomes first, leaving conclusiveness measurement for later. This shows flexibility of presented framework and opens possibilities for further optimization. We present discussion also on biased qubit case as well as general case of unambiguous quantum state discrimination in higher dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twist defects in surface codes can be used to encode more logical qubits, improve the code rate, and implement logical gates. In this work we provide a rigorous formalism for constructing surface codes with twists generalizing the well-defined homological formalism introduced by Kitaev for describing CSS surface codes. In particular, we associate a surface code to \emph{any} graph $G$ embedded on \emph{any} 2D-manifold, in such a way that (1) qubits are associated to the vertices of the graph, (2) stabilizers are associated to faces, (3) twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices. In this way, we are able to reproduce the variety of surface codes, with and without twists, in the literature and produce some new examples. We also calculate and bound various code properties such as the rate and distance in terms of topological graph properties such as genus, systole, and face-width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixedness of one share of a pure bipartite state determines whether the overall state is a separable, unentangled state. Here we consider quantum computational tests of mixedness, and we derive an exact expression of the acceptance probability of such tests as the number of copies of the state becomes larger. We prove that the analytical form of this expression is given by the cycle index polynomial of the symmetric group $S_k$, which is itself related to the Bell polynomials. After doing so, we derive a family of quantum separability tests, each of which is generated by a finite group; for all such algorithms, we show that the acceptance probability is determined by the cycle index polynomial of the group. Finally, we produce and analyze explicit circuit constructions for these tests, showing that the tests corresponding to the symmetric and cyclic groups can be executed with $O(k^2)$ and $O(k\log(k))$ controlled-SWAP gates, respectively, where $k$ is the number of copies of the state being tested.</description>

      <title>All-optical quantum computing using cubic phase gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If suitable quantum optical interactions were available, transforming optical field mode operators in a nonlinear fashion, the all-photonics platform could be one of the strongest contenders for realizing a quantum computer. Unlike other, matter-based (solid-state or atomic) platforms, photonic qubits can be operated at room temperature and high clock rates (GHz or, in principle, even THz). In addition, recent continuous-variable time-domain approaches are extremely well scalable. Moreover, while single-photon qubits may be processed directly, "brighter" logical qubits may be embedded in individual oscillator modes, using so-called bosonic codes, for an in-principle fault-tolerant processing. In this paper, we show how elements of all-optical, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation can be implemented using only beam splitters together with single-mode cubic phase gates in reasonable numbers, and possibly off-line squeezed-state or single-photon resources. Our approach is based on a decomposition technique combining exact gate decompositions and approximate Trotterization. This allows for efficient decompositions of certain nonlinear continuous-variable multimode gates into the elementary gates, where the few cubic gates needed may even be weak or all identical, thus facilitating potential experiments. The final gate operations include two-mode controlled phase rotation and three-mode Rabi-type Hamiltonian gates, which are shown to be employable for realizing high-fidelity single-photon two-qubit entangling gates or, as a bosonic-code example, creating high-quality Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states. We expect our method of general use with various applications, including those that rely on quartic Kerr-type interactions.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the scattering entropy of quantum graphs in many different circumstances. We first consider the case of the Shannon entropy and then the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, which are more adequate to study distinct quantitative behavior such as entanglement and nonextensive behavior, respectively. We describe many results associated with different types of quantum graphs in the presence of several vertices, edges, and leads. In particular, we think the results may be used as quantifiers in models related to the transport in quantum graphs.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction for circuits with low gate count and depth, implementing three- and four-body Pauli-Z product operators as they appear in the form of plaquette-shaped constraints in QAOA when using the parity mapping. The circuits can be implemented on any quantum device with nearest-neighbor connectivity on a square-lattice, using only one gate type and one orientation of two-qubit gates at a time. We find an upper bound for the circuit depth which is independent of the system size. The procedure is readily adjustable to hardware-specific restrictions, such as a minimum required spatial distance between simultaneously executed gates, or gates only being simultaneously executable within a subset of all the qubits, for example a single line.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing from Finite Temperature Easy-plane Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin squeezing is a form of entanglement that reshapes the quantum projection noise to improve measurement precision. Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite temperature, easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin-squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies in between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential weak measurements allow the direct extraction of individual density-matrix elements instead of globally reconstructing the whole density matrix, opening a new avenue for the characterization of quantum systems. Nevertheless, the requirement of multiple coupling for each qudit of quantum systems and the lack of appropriate precision evaluation constraint its applicability extension, especially for multi-qudit quantum systems. Here, we propose a resource-efficient scheme (RES) to directly characterize the density matrix of general multi-qudit systems, which not only optimizes the measurements but also establishes a feasible estimation analysis. In this scheme, an efficient observable of quantum system is constructed such that a single meter state coupled to each qudit is sufficient to extract the corresponding density-matrix element. An appropriate model based on the statistical distribution of errors are used to evaluate the precision and feasibility of the scheme. We experimentally apply the RES to the direct characterization of general single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled states. The results show that the RES outperforms the sequential schemes in terms of efficiency and precision in both weak- and strong- coupling scenarios. This work sheds new light on the practical characterization of large-scale quantum systems and investigation of their non-classical properties.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Quantum Dynamical Embedding Method for Long-term Prediction on Near-term Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing focus on long-term time series prediction across various fields has been significantly strengthened by advancements in quantum computation. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method designed for long-term time series prediction with quantum dynamical embedding (QDE). This approach enables a trainable embedding of the data space into an extended state space, allowing for the recursive retrieval of time series information. Based on its independence of time series length, this method achieves depth-efficient quantum circuits that are crucial for near-term quantum computers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's improved performance in prediction accuracy and resource efficiency over existing methods, as well as its effective denoising capabilities. We implement this model on the Origin ''Wukong'' superconducting quantum processor with a learnable error-cancellation layer (LECL) for error mitigation, further validating the practical applicability of our approach on near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the QDE's dynamical properties and its universality enhances its potential for time series prediction. This study establishes a significant step towards the processing of long-term time series on near-term quantum computers, integrating data-driven learning with discrete dynamical embedding for enhanced forecasting capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We explore the information which proposed matterwave interferometry experiments with large test masses can provide about parameterizable extensions to quantum mechanics, such as have been proposed to explain the apparent quantum to classical transition. Specifically, we consider a matterwave near-field Talbot interferometer and Continuous Spontaneous Localisation (CSL). Using Bayesian inference we compute the effect of decoherence mechanisms including pressure and blackbody radiation, find estimates for the number of measurements required, and provide a procedure for optimal choice of experimental control variables. We show that in a MAQRO like experiment it is possible to reach masses of $\sim10^9\,\text{u}$ and we quantify the bounds which can be placed on CSL. These specific results can be used to inform experimental design and the general approach can be applied to other parameterizable models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum systems of infinite dimension, such as bosonic oscillators, provide vast resources for quantum sensing. Yet, a general theory on how to manipulate such bosonic modes for sensing beyond parameter estimation is unknown. We present a general algorithmic framework, quantum signal processing interferometry (QSPI), for quantum sensing at the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics by generalizing Ramsey-type interferometry. Our QSPI sensing protocol relies on performing nonlinear polynomial transformations on the oscillator's quadrature operators by generalizing quantum signal processing (QSP) from qubits to hybrid qubit-oscillator systems. We use our QSPI sensing framework to make efficient binary decisions on a displacement channel in the single-shot limit. Theoretical analysis suggests the sensing accuracy, given a single-shot qubit measurement, scales inversely with the sensing time or circuit depth of the algorithm. We further concatenate a series of such binary decisions to perform parameter estimation in a bit-by-bit fashion. Numerical simulations are performed to support these statements. Our QSPI protocol offers a unified framework for quantum sensing using continuous-variable bosonic systems beyond parameter estimation and establishes a promising avenue toward efficient and scalable quantum control and quantum sensing schemes beyond the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and some of its variations using tensor networks. This approach consists on the simulated initialization of a quantum system with superposition of all possible combinations, an imaginary time evolution, a projection, and lastly a partial trace to search for solutions. This is a heuristically approximable algorithm to obtain approximate solutions with a more affordable computational cost. We adapt it to different generalizations of the TSP and apply it to the job reassignment problem, a real productive industrial case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. A 107, 012427 (2023)], A. J. Baldwin and J. A. Jones proved that Uhlmann-Jozsa's fidelity between two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, i.e., $F(\rho,\sigma)~:=~(Tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}})^2$, can be written in a simplified form as $F(\rho,\sigma) = (Tr\sqrt{\rho\sigma})^2$. In this article, we give an alternative proof of this result, using a function power series expansion and the properties of the trace function. Our approach not only reinforces the validity of the simplified expression but also facilitates the exploration of novel dissimilarity functions for quantum states and more complex trace functions of a density operator.</description>

Abstract: A method is proposed to produce a classical optical state that is `intersystem nonseparable' and a close analog of the $\phi^+$ Bell state. A derivation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is sketched within the framework of classical polarization optics, using non-contextuality for factorizable states as an axiom rather than any hidden variable theory. It is shown that the classical state violates this inequality.</description>

      <title>Generalized Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property for subalgebra entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Stein's lemma is a fundamental result of quantum hypothesis testing in the context of distinguishing two quantum states. A recent conjecture, known as the ``generalized quantum Stein's lemma", asserts that this result is true in a general framework where one of the states is replaced by convex sets of quantum states. In this work, we show that the assertion of the generalized Stein's lemma is true for the setting where the second hypothesis is the state space of any subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$. This is obtained through a strong asymptotic equipartition property for smooth subalgebra entropies that applies for any fixed smoothing parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. As an application in resource theory, we show that the relative entropy of a subalgebra is the asymptotic dilution cost under suitable operations. This provides a scope to establish a connection between different quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Photon Fusion for Genuine Multiphoton Quantum Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusing photon pairs creates an arena where indistinguishability can exist between two two-photon amplitudes contributing to the same joint photodetection event. This two-photon interference has been extensively utilized in creating multiphoton entanglement, from passive to scalable generation, from bulk-optical to chip-scale implementations. While significant, no experimental evidence exists that the full capability of photon fusion can be utterly quantified like a quantum entity. Herein, we demonstrate the first complete capability quantification of experimental photon fusion. Our characterization faithfully measures the whole abilities of photon fusion in the experiment to create and preserve entangled photon pairs. With the created four- and six-photon entangled states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources, we show that capability quantification provides a faithful assessment of interferometry for generating genuine multiphoton entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. These results reveal a practical diagnostic method to benchmark photon fusion underlying the primitive operations in general quantum photonics devices and networks.</description>

Abstract: The non-equilibrium physics of many-body quantum systems harbors various unconventional phenomena. In this study, we experimentally investigate one of the most puzzling of these phenomena -- the quantum Mpemba effect, where a tilted ferromagnet restores its symmetry more rapidly when it is farther from the symmetric state compared to when it is closer. We present the first experimental evidence of the occurrence of this effect in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. The symmetry breaking and restoration are monitored through entanglement asymmetry, probed via randomized measurements, and postprocessed using the classical shadows technique. Our findings are further substantiated by measuring the Frobenius distance between the experimental state and the stationary thermal symmetric theoretical state, offering direct evidence of subsystem thermalization.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an all-fiber telecom-range optical gyroscope employing a spontaneous parametric down conversion crystal to produce ultra-low intensity thermal light by tracing-out one of the heralded photons. The prototype exhibits a detection limit on photon delay measurements of $249$ zs over a $72$ s averaging time and 26 zs in differential delay measurements at $t=10^4$ s averaging. The detection scheme proves to be the most resource-efficient possible, saturating $&gt;99.5\%$ of the Cram\'er-Rao bound. These results are groundbreaking in the context of low-photon regime quantum metrology, paving the way to novel experimental configurations to bridge quantum optics with special or general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Depth scaling of unstructured search via quantum approximate optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have become the de facto model for current quantum computations. A prominent example of such algorithms -- the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- was originally designed for combinatorial optimization tasks, but has been shown to be successful for a variety of other problems. However, for most of these problems the optimal circuit depth remains unknown. One such problem is unstructured search which consists on finding a particular bit string, or equivalently, preparing a state of high overlap with a target state. To bound the optimal QAOA depth for such problem we build on its known solution in a continuous time quantum walk (CTQW). We trotterize a CTQW to recover a QAOA sequence, and employ recent advances on the theory of Trotter formulas to bound the query complexity (circuit depth) needed to prepare a state of almost perfect overlap with the target state. The obtained complexity exceeds the Grover's algorithm complexity $O\left(N^\frac{1}{2}\right)$, but remains smaller than $O \left(N^{\frac{1}{2}+c}\right)$ for any $c&gt;0$, which shows quantum advantage of QAOA over classical solutions. We verify our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of up to 68 qubits, which demonstrate that our result overestimates the number of QAOA layers resulting from a trotterized CTQW by at most a polynomial factor.</description>

Abstract: We propose a direct (non-recursive) algorithm for applying a rotation $R_{\theta^\ast}$, $\epsilon$-close to a desired rotation $R_\theta$, to a single qubit using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set. Our algorithm does not rely on repeatedly applying a fixed rotation, but immediately applies $R_{\theta^\ast}$. It succeeds with probability strictly greater than $1/2$, has an expected number of repetitions strictly less than 2, expected Toffoli count logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$, and expected gate depth also logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a it $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We show several examples for which, in good approximation, $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ with a constant of proportionality slightly larger than one. We argue that one should have the inequality $S_{A}^{vN}\geq(2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ holding in more general circumstances. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: For harnessing the full potential of quantum phenomena, light-matter interfaces and complexly connected quantum networks are required, relying on the joint quantum operation of different physical platforms. In this work, we analyze the quantum properties of multipartite quantum systems, consisting of an arbitrarily large collection of optical cavities with two-level atoms. In particular, we explore quantum walks in such systems and determine the resulting entanglement. Realistic imperfections are included in the model as optical losses and spontaneous decays of atoms. The topology of torus and the non-orientable M\"obius strip serve as examples of complex networks we consider, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and resulting in interesting quantum dynamics and interference effects for quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a quantum-mechanically measurable basis for the computation of spread complexity. Current literature focuses on computing different powers of the Hamiltonian to construct a basis for the Krylov state space and the computation of the spread complexity. We show, through a series of proofs, that time-evolved states with different evolution times can be used to construct an equivalent space to the Krylov state space used in the computation of the spread complexity. Afterwards, we introduce the effective dimension, which is upper-bounded by the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The computation of the spread complexity requires knowledge of the Hamiltonian and a classical computation of the different powers of the Hamiltonian. The computation of large powers of the Hamiltonian becomes increasingly difficult for large systems. The first part of our work addresses these issues by defining an equivalent space, where the original basis consists of quantum-mechanically measurable states. We demonstrate that a set of different time-evolved states can be used to construct a basis. We subsequently verify the results through numerical analysis, demonstrating that every time-evolved state can be reconstructed using the defined vector space. Based on this new space, we define an upper-bounded effective dimension and analyze its influence on finite-dimensional systems. We further show that the Krylov space dimension is equal to the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, enabling a method to determine the number of eigenenergies the system has experimentally. Lastly, we compute the spread complexities of both basis representations and observe almost identical behavior, thus enabling the computation of spread complexities through measurements.</description>

Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the main quantum computation models to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. However, this aim may be hard to realize considering noise sources such as photon distinguishability. Inspired by the Bayesian validation extended to evaluate whether photon distinguishability is too high to demonstrate this advantage, the pattern recognition validation is extended for boson sampling. Based on clusters constructed with the K means++ method, the distribution of characteristic values is nearly monotonically changed with the photon indistinguishability, especially when photons are close to be indistinguishable. We analyze the intrinsic data structure through calculating probability distributions and mean 2-norm distances of the sorted outputs. An approximation algorithm is also used to show the regular data structure changes with photon distinguishability.</description>

Since the individual quantum particles detected at any of the outputs of the interferometer have not been absorbed, any non-trivial effect of the absorber on the distribution of these particles over these paths is a counterfactual effect. Here, we quantify counterfactual effects by evaluating the information about the presence or absence of the absorber obtained from the output statistics, distinguishing between classical and quantum counterfactual effects. We identify the counterfactual gain which quantifies the advantage of quantum counterfactual protocols over classical counterfactual protocols, and show that this counterfactual gain can be separated into two terms: a semi-classical term related to the amplitude blocked by the absorber, and a Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability assigning a joint probability to the blocked path and the output port. A negative Kirkwood-Dirac term between a path and an output port indicates that inserting the absorber into that path will have a focussing effect, increasing the probability of particles arriving at that output port, resulting in a significant enhancement of the counterfactual gain. We show that the magnitude of quantum counterfactual effects cannot be explained by a simple removal of the absorbed particles, but originates instead from a well-defined back-action effect caused by the presence of the absorber in one path, on particles in other paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small organic molecules with two promising quantum computing platforms, namely IBM's quantum processors based on superconducting qubits and IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer addressed via Amazon Braket. We analyze the impact of noise on the obtained NMR spectra, and we formulate an effective decoherence rate that quantifies the threshold noise that our proposed algorithm can tolerate. Furthermore we showcase how our noise analysis allows us to improve the spectra. Our investigations pave the way to better employ such application-driven quantum tasks on current noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Insecurity of Quantum Two-Party Computation with Applications to Cheat-Sensitive Protocols and Oblivious Transfer Reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental primitive for secure two-party computation. It is well known that OT cannot be implemented with information-theoretic security if the two players only have access to noiseless communication channels, even in the quantum case. As a result, weaker variants of OT have been studied. In this work, we rigorously establish the impossibility of cheat-sensitive OT, where a dishonest party can cheat, but risks being detected. We construct a general attack on any quantum protocol that allows the receiver to compute all inputs of the sender and provide an explicit upper bound on the success probability of this attack. This implies that cheat-sensitive quantum Symmetric Private Information Retrieval cannot be implemented with statistical information-theoretic security. Leveraging the techniques devised for our proofs, we provide entropic bounds on primitives needed for secure function evaluation. They imply impossibility results for protocols where the players have access to OT as a resource. This result significantly improves upon existing bounds and yields tight bounds for reductions of 1-out-of-n OT to a resource primitive. Our results hold in particular for transformations between a finite number of primitives and for any error.</description>

Abstract: Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins and harmonic oscillators provide multi-level manifolds (e.g., qudits) which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on-demand to implement a continuous range of generators associated to resonant driving of a harmonic qudit, and then specifically design a harmonic multi-level spin degree of freedom. The synthetic spin is verified by demonstration of spin coherent (SU(2)) rotations and comparison to other manifolds like simply-truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows universal control of the qudit, and, for the first time, we use linear, harmonic operations to accomplish four logical gates on a harmonic qudit encoding. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations for quantum measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of such measurements. The existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Measurements of interest are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the considered measurements, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. It is interesting that certain restrictions hold irrespectively to overcompleteness. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A resource theory imposes a preorder over states, with one state being above another if the first can be converted to the second by a free operation, and where the set of free operations defines the notion of resourcefulness under study. In general, the location of a state in the preorder of one resource theory can constrain its location in the preorder of a different resource theory. It follows that there can be nontrivial dependence relations between different notions of resourcefulness. In this article, we lay out the conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations. In particular, we note that the relations holding among a set of monotones that includes a complete set for each resource theory provides a full characterization of resource dependence relations. As an example, we consider three resource theories concerning the about-face asymmetry properties of a qubit along three mutually orthogonal axes on the Bloch ball, where about-face symmetry refers to a representation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, consisting of the identity map and a $\pi$ rotation about the given axis. This example is sufficiently simple that we are able to derive a complete set of monotones for each resource theory and to determine all of the relations that hold among these monotones, thereby completely solving the problem of determining resource dependence relations. Nonetheless, we show that even in this simplest of examples, these relations are already quite nuanced.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) photonics leverages photonic chips to accelerate artificial intelligence, offering high-speed and energy efficient solutions in RF communication, tensor processing, and data classification. However, the limited physical size of integrated photonic hardware constrains network complexity and computational capacity. In light of recent advances in photonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential speedup to scale photonic neural network capabilities. Here we show a combination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable quantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and accuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same performance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice the size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through added noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated at state of the art bit precision. These hybrid quantum classical networks demonstrate a unique route to improve computational capacity of integrated photonic neural networks without increasing the physical network size.</description>

Abstract: Since Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (2009) showed that a system of linear equations with $N$ variables and condition number $\kappa$ can be solved on a quantum computer in $\operatorname{poly}(\log(N), \kappa)$ time, exponentially faster than any classical algorithms, its improvements and applications have been extensively investigated. The state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for this problem is due to Costa, An, Sanders, Su, Babbush, and Berry (2022), with optimal query complexity $\Theta(\kappa)$. An important question left is whether parallelism can bring further optimization. In this paper, we study the limitation of parallel quantum computing on this problem. We show that any quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(\log(N), \kappa)$ has a lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa)$ on the depth of queries, which is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The worldline method is a powerful numerical path-integral framework for computing Casimir and Casimir-Polder energies. An important challenge arises when one desires derivatives of path-integral quantities--standard finite-difference techniques, for example, yield results of poor accuracy. In this work we present methods for computing derivatives of worldline-type path integrals of scalar fields to calculate forces, energy curvatures, and torques. In Casimir-Polder-type path integrals, which require derivatives with respect to the source point of the paths, the derivatives can be computed by a simple reweighting of the path integral. However, a partial-averaging technique is necessary to render the differentiated path integral computationally efficient. We also discuss the computation of Casimir forces, curvatures, and torques between macroscopic bodies. Here a different method is used, involving summing over the derivatives of all the intersections with a body; again, a different partial-averaging method makes the path integral efficient. To demonstrate the efficiency of the techniques, we give the results of numerical implementations of these worldline methods in atomplane and plane-plane geometries. Being quite general, the methods here should apply to path integrals outside the worldline context (e.g., financial mathematics).</description>

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) amalgamates quantum computing paradigms with machine learning models, providing significant prospects for solving complex problems. However, with the expansion of numerous third-party vendors in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, the security of QML models is of prime importance, particularly against reverse engineering, which could expose trained parameters and algorithms of the models. We assume the untrusted quantum cloud provider is an adversary having white-box access to the transpiled user-designed trained QML model during inference. Reverse engineering (RE) to extract the pre-transpiled QML circuit will enable re-transpilation and usage of the model for various hardware with completely different native gate sets and even different qubit technology. Such flexibility may not be obtained from the transpiled circuit which is tied to a particular hardware and qubit technology. The information about the number of parameters, and optimized values can allow further training of the QML model to alter the QML model, tamper with the watermark, and/or embed their own watermark or refine the model for other purposes. In this first effort to investigate the RE of QML circuits, we perform RE and compare the training accuracy of original and reverse-engineered Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) of various sizes. We note that multi-qubit classifiers can be reverse-engineered under specific conditions with a mean error of order 1e-2 in a reasonable time. We also propose adding dummy fixed parametric gates in the QML models to increase the RE overhead for defense. For instance, adding 2 dummy qubits and 2 layers increases the overhead by ~1.76 times for a classifier with 2 qubits and 3 layers with a performance overhead of less than 9%. We note that RE is a very powerful attack model which warrants further efforts on defenses.</description>

Abstract: A Kerr nonlinear oscillator (KNO) supports a pair of steady eigenstates, coherent states with opposite phases, that are good for the encoding of continuous variable qubit basis states. Arbitrary control of the KNO confined within the steady state subspace allows extraction of the Berry curvature through the linear response of the physical observable to the quench velocity of the system, providing an effective method for the characterization of topology in the KNO. As an alternative, the control adopting the "shortcut to adiabaticity" to the KNO enables the exploration of the topology through accelerated adiabatic eigenstate evolution to measure all three physical observables. Topological transitions are revealed by the jump of the first Chern number, obtained respectively from the integral of the Berry curvature and of the new polar angle relation, over the whole parameter space. Our strategy paves the way for measuring topological transitions in continuous variable systems.</description>

      <title>Long-fiber Sagnac interferometers for twin field quantum key distribution networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Sagnac loop structure can help overcome the major difficulty in the practical implementation of a twin field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) network, namely, the need to stabilize the phase of a quantum state over many kilometers of fiber. Unfortunately, Rayleigh backscattering noise limits the signal-to-noise ratio for Sagnac systems containing long fibers and lossy photonic devices. Here, we solve this problem by sending optical pulses in long on-off bursts and using time post-selection on measurements taken with free-run single-photon avalanche detectors. We also investigate the impact of the residual phase noise uncompensated by the Sagnac structure and find that the variance of the phase noise scales as loop length to the third power, verifying an existing calculation in the literature. We measure the interference visibility in Sagnac loops of varying length without active phase or polarization stabilization and achieve &gt; 97% visibility in 200 km ultra-low-loss fiber, which is, to our knowledge, the longest fiber Sagnac interferometer demonstrated. Our results indicate the suitability of a Sagnac system for long-distance TFQKD networks, an important step towards the practical implementation of metropolitan quantum networks.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Silicon Photonic Single-Sideband Modulators for Cold Atom Interferometry</title>

Abstract: The most complicated and challenging system within a light-pulse atom interferometer (LPAI) is the laser system, which controls the frequencies and intensities of multiple laser beams over time to configure quantum gravity and inertial sensors. The main function of an LPAI laser system is to perform cold-atom generation, state-preparation, state-selective detection and to generate coherent two-photon process for the light-pulse sequence. Substantial miniaturization and ruggedization of the laser system can be achieved by bringing most key functions of the laser system onto photonic integrated circuit (PIC). We demonstrate a high-performance silicon photonic suppressed-carrier single-sideband (SC-SSB) modulator at 1560 nm, which can dynamically frequency shift within the LPAI. With independent RF-channel control, we study the imbalances in both the optical and RF phases/amplitudes to reach 30 dB carrier-suppression, unprecedented 47.8 dB sideband-suppression at peak conversion-efficiency: -6.846 dB (20.7 %). Using a silicon photonic SSB-modulator, we demonstrate cold-atom generation, state-selective detection, and atom interferometer fringes to estimate gravitational acceleration, $g \approx 9.77 \pm 0.01 \,\rm{m/s^2}$, in a Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atom system.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks for simulating computational fluid dynamics in complex shapes</title>

Abstract: Finding the distribution of the velocities and pressures of a fluid by solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a principal task in the chemical, energy, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in mechanical engineering and the design of pipeline systems. With existing solvers, such as OpenFOAM and Ansys, simulations of fluid dynamics in intricate geometries are computationally expensive and require re-simulation whenever the geometric parameters or the initial and boundary conditions are altered. Physics-informed neural networks are a promising tool for simulating fluid flows in complex geometries, as they can adapt to changes in the geometry and mesh definitions, allowing for generalization across fluid parameters and transfer learning across different shapes. We present a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network that simulates laminar fluid flows in 3D Y-shaped mixers. Our approach combines the expressive power of a quantum model with the flexibility of a physics-informed neural network, resulting in a 21% higher accuracy compared to a purely classical neural network. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning approaches, and in particular hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network, for complex shape optimization tasks in computational fluid dynamics. By improving the accuracy of fluid simulations in complex geometries, our research using hybrid quantum models contributes to the development of more efficient and reliable fluid dynamics solvers.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Quantum Spin Liquids and Dynamical Anyon Condensations in Kitaev Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids and anyons, used to be subjects of condensed matter physics, now are realized in various platforms of qubits, offering unprecedented opportunities to investigate fundamental physics of many-body quantum entangled states. Qubits are inevitably exposed to environment effects such as decoherence and dissipation, which are believed to be detrimental to many-body entanglement. Here, we argue that unlike the common belief decoherence and dissipation can give rise to novel topological phenomena in quantum spin liquids. We study open quantum systems of the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code via the Lindblad master equation approach. By using exact solutions and numerical approaches, we show the dynamical occurrence of anyon condensation by decoherence and dissipation, which results in a topological transition from the initial state spin liquid to the steady state spin liquid. The mechanism of the anyon condensation transition by the Lindblad dynamics is elucidated. We also provide an insight into the relationship between the Kitaev spin liquid and the toric code in the picture of anyon condensation. Our work suggests open quantum systems to be a new venue for topological phenomena of quantum spin liquids and anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topologically protected semi-metallic band crossings to hyperbolic lattices in a negatively curved plane. Because of their distinct translation group structure, such lattices are associated with a high-dimensional reciprocal space. In addition, they support non-Abelian Bloch states which, unlike conventional Bloch states, acquire a matrix-valued Bloch factor under lattice translations. Combining diverse numerical and analytical approaches, we uncover an unconventional scaling in the density of states at low energies, and illuminate a nodal manifold of codimension five in the reciprocal space. The nodal manifold is topologically protected by a nonzero second Chern number, reminiscent of the characterization of Weyl nodes by the first Chern number.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Curriculum Transformation in Quantum Information Science and Technology Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology (QIST) is booming. Due to this, many new educational courses and university programs are needed in order to prepare a workforce for the developing industry. Owing to its specialist nature, teaching approaches in this field can easily become disconnected from the substantial degree of science education research which aims to support the best approaches to teaching in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM) fields. In order to connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we have synthesised this educational research into a decision-tree based theoretical model for the transformation of QIST curricula, intended to provide a didactical perspective for practitioners. The Quantum Curriculum Transformation Framework (QCTF) consists of four steps: 1. choose a topic, 2. choose one or more targeted skills, 3. choose a learning goal and 4. choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way, educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and with future testing and refinement it will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Atom-Molecule Superfluids Near a Narrow Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of a stable molecular condensate emerging from a condensate of bosonic atoms and related "super-chemical" dynamics have raised an intriguing set of questions. Here we provide a microscopic understanding of this unexpected stability and dynamics in atom-molecule superfluids; we show one essential element behind these phenomena is an extremely narrow Feshbach resonance in $^{133}$Cs at 19.849G. Comparing theory and experiment we demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\textit{i.e.}, Bose enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the formation of Cooper-like pairs of bosonic atoms that have opposite momenta. Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical representations of graphs often resemble adjacency matrices or lists, representations that facilitate whiteboard reasoning and algorithm design. In the realm of proof assistants, inductive representations effectively define semantics for formal reasoning. This highlights a gap where algorithm design and proof assistants require a fundamentally different structure of graphs, particularly for process theories which represent programs using graphs. To address this gap, we present VyZX, a verified library for reasoning about inductively defined graphical languages. These inductive constructs arise naturally from category theory definitions. A key goal for VyZX is to Verify the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation. The ZX-calculus comes with a collection of diagrammatic rewrite rules that preserve the graph's semantic interpretation. We show how inductive graphs in VyZX are used to prove the correctness of the ZX-calculus rewrite rules and apply them in practice using standard proof assistant techniques. VyZX integrates easily with the proof engineer's workflow through visualization and automation.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [M. Hopjan and L. Vidmar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023); Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the {\it operator growth hypothesis} with questions of localization. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and consistent with the general bound for an ergodic system. Also, there is no exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length. We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting and non-interacting cases when trying to perturbatively transform the microscopic to an effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim 4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC electric current: From perturbative to nonperturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) regimes in a unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects. From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or absence of $(2n+1)$th-, $2n$th-, or $3n$th-order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$). The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an efficient parameter.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose {\it measurement-producing hierarchy} emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Technology masters: A shortcut to the quantum industry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.</description>
