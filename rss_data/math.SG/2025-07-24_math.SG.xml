      <title>Eigenfunction asymptotics in the complex domain for a compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(G,\kappa)$ be a compact connected Lie group endowed with a biinvariant Riemannian metric, and let $\tilde{G}$ be the complexification of $G$. We apply Grauert tube techniques to the near-diagonal scaling asymptotics of certain operator kernels, which are defined in terms of the matrix elements of an irreducuble representation drifting to infinity along a ray in weight space. These kernels are the equivariant components of Poisson and Szeg\H{o} kernels on a fixed sphere bundle in $\tilde{G}$, when the latter is identified with the tangent bundle of $G$ in an appropriate way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Poisson $C^\infty$-rings and Poisson local
  $C^\infty$-ringed spaces. We show that the spectrum of a Poisson
  $C^\infty$-ring is an affine Poisson $C^\infty$-scheme. We then discuss
  applications that include singular symplectic and Poisson
  reductions, singular quasi-Poisson reduction, coisotropic reduction
  and Poisson-Dirac subschemes.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method of constructing structure-preserving integrators for Hamiltonian systems in Jacobi manifolds. Hamiltonian mechanics, rooted in symplectic and Poisson geometry, has long provided a foundation for modelling conservative systems in classical physics. Jacobi manifolds, generalizing both contact and Poisson manifolds, extend this theory and are suitable for incorporating time-dependent, dissipative and thermodynamic phenomena.
  Building on recent advances in geometric integrators - specifically Poisson Hamiltonian Integrators (PHI), which preserve key features of Poisson systems - we propose a construction of Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators. Our approach explores the correspondence between Jacobi and homogeneous Poisson manifolds, with the aim of extending the PHI techniques while ensuring preservation of the homogeneity structure.
  This work develops the theoretical tools required for this generalization and outlines a numerical integration technique compatible with Jacobi dynamics. By focusing on the homogeneous Poisson perspective rather than on direct contact realizations, we provide a clear pathway for structure-preserving integration of time-dependent and dissipative systems within the Jacobi framework.</description>

      <title>J-tamed inflation via tame to compatible deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete and self-contained exposition of the $J$-tame inflation lemma: Given any tame almost complex structure $J$ on a symplectic $4$-manifold $(M,\omega)$, and given any compact, embedded, $J$-holomorphic submanifold $Z$, it is always possible to construct a deformation of symplectic forms $\omega_t$ in classes $[\omega_t]=[\omega]+t\mathrm{PD}{Z}$, for $0\leq t$ less than an upper bound $0&lt;T$ that only depends on the self-intersection $Z\cdot Z$. The original proofs of this fact make the unwarranted assumption that one can find a family of normal planes along $Z$ that is both $J$ invariant and $\omega$-orthogonal to $TZ$ -- which amounts, in effect, to assuming the compatibility of $J$ and $\omega$ along $Z$. We explain how the original constructions can be adapted to avoid this assumption when $Z$ has nonpositive self-intersection, and we discuss the difficulties with this line of argument in general to establish the full inflation when $Z$ has positive self-intersection. We overcome this problem by proving a `preparation lemma', which states that prior to inflation, one can isotope $\omega$ within its cohomology class to a new form that still tames $J$ and which is compatible with $J$ along the submanifold $Z$. This preparation lemma can be regarded as an infinitesimal version of the "tamed-to-compatible" conjecture of S. K. Donaldson along an almost-complex submanifold $Z$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant scaling asymptotics for Poisson and Szeg\H{o} kernels on Grauert tube boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,\kappa)$ be a closed and connected real-analytic Riemannian manifold, acted upon by a compact Lie group of isometries $G$. We consider the following two kinds of equivariant asymptotics along a fixed Grauer tube boundary $X^\tau$ of $(M,\kappa)$.
  1): Given the induced unitary representation of $G$ on the eigenspaces of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$, these split over the irreducible representations of $G$. On the other hand, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$ admit a simultaneous complexification to some Grauert tube. We study the asymptotic concentration along $X^\tau$ of the complexified eigenfunctions pertaining to a fixed isotypical component.
  2): There are furthermore an induced action of $G$ as a group of CR and contact automorphisms on $X^\tau$, and a corresponding unitary representation on the Hardy space $H(X^\tau)$. The action of $G$ on $X^\tau$ commutes with the homogeneous \lq geogesic flow\rq\, and the representation on the Hardy space commutes with the elliptic self-adjoint Toeplitz operator induced by the generator of the goedesic flow. Hence each eigenspace of the latter also splits over the irreducible representations of $G$. We study the asymptotic concentration of the eigenfunctions in a given isotypical component.
  We also give some applications of these asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On weakly exact Lagrangians in Liouville bi-fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we study several questions concerning Liouville domains that are diffeomorphic to cylinders, so called trivial bi-fillings, for which the Liouville skeleton moreover is smooth and of codimension one; we also propose the notion of a Liouville-Hamiltonian structure, which encodes the symplectic structure of a hypersurface tangent to the Liouville flow, e.g. the skeleta of certain bi-fillings. We show that the symplectic homology of a bi-filling is non-trivial, and that a connected Lagrangian inside a bi-filling whose boundary lives in different components of the contact boundary automatically has non-vanishing wrapped Floer cohomology. We also prove geometric vanishing and non-vanishing criteria for the wrapped Floer cohomology of an exact Lagrangian with disconnected cylindrical ends. Finally, we give homotopy-theoretic restrictions on the closed weakly exact Lagrangians in the McDuff and torus bundle Liouville domains.</description>

      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry on the $\ell^2$-Simplex via the $q$-Root Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{$\ell^p$-information geometry}, an infinite dimensional framework that shares key features with the geometry of the space of probability densities \( \mathrm{Dens}(M) \) on a closed manifold, while also incorporating aspects of measure-valued information geometry. We define the \emph{$\ell^2$-probability simplex} with a noncanonical differentiable structure induced via the \emph{$q$-root transform} from an open subset of the $\ell^p$-sphere. This structure renders the $q$-root map an \emph{isometry}, enabling the definition of \emph{Amari--\v{C}encov $\alpha$-connections} in this setting.
  We further construct \emph{gradient flows} with respect to the $\ell^2$ Fisher--Rao metric, which solve an infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem. These flows are intimately linked to an \emph{integrable Hamiltonian system} via a \emph{momentum map} arising from a Hamiltonian group action on the infinite-dimensional complex projective space.</description>

      <title>Bordered contact invariants and half Giroux torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many closed contact 3-manifolds containing half Giroux torsion along a separating torus whose contact invariants do not vanish. This provides counterexamples to Ghiggini's conjecture and suggests that separating half Giroux torsion may not obstruct symplectic fillability. The main tools are the bordered contact invariants recently developed by the authors and the innermost contact structures on knot complements. We also show that there exists a closed contact 3-manifold containing convex torsion along a separating torus with non-vanishing contact invariant, which implies that $2\pi$ is the minimal amount of twisting necessary to ensure vanishing of the contact invariant.</description>
