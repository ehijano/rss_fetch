      <title>GEO600 beam splitter thermal compensation system: new design and commissioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves have revolutionised the field of astronomy by providing scientists with a new way to observe the universe and gain a better understanding of exotic objects like black holes. Several large-scale laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) have been constructed worldwide, with a focus on achieving the best sensitivity possible. However, in order for a detector to operate at its intended sensitivity, its optics must be free from imperfections such as thermal lensing effects. In the GEO\,600 gravitational wave detector, the beam splitter (BS) experiences a significant thermal lensing effect due to the high power build-up in the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) combined with a very small beam waist. This causes the fundamental mode to be converted into higher order modes (HOMs), subsequently impacting the detector's performance. To address this issue, the GEO\,600 detector is equipped with a thermal compensation system (TCS) applied to the BS. This involves projecting a spatially tunable heating pattern through an optical system onto the beam splitter. The main objective of the TCS is to counteract the thermal lens at the BS and restore the detector to its ideal operating condition. This paper presents the new beam splitter TCS in GEO\,600, its commissioning, and its effect on strain sensitivity. It also outlines the planned upgrade to further enhance the performance of the TCS.</description>

      <title>A new code for low-resolution spectral identification of white dwarf binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close white dwarf binaries (CWDBs) are considered to be progenitors of several exotic astronomical phenomena (e.g., type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables). These violent events are broadly used in studies of general relativity and cosmology. However, obtaining precise stellar parameter measurements for both components of CWDBs is a challenging task given their low luminosities, swift time variation, and complex orbits. High-resolution spectra (R$&gt; 20 000$) are preferred but expensive, resulting in a sample size that is insufficient for robust population study. To release the full potential of the less expensive low-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and thus greatly expand the CWDB sample size, it is necessary to develop a robust pipeline for spectra decomposition and analysis. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to build spectrum generators for DA/DB white dwarfs and main-sequence stars. The best-fit stellar parameters were obtained by finding the least $\chi^2$ solution to these feature lines and the continuum simultaneously. We demonstrate the reliability of our code with two well-studied CWDBs, WD 1534+503 and PG 1224+309. We also estimate the stellar parameters of 14 newly identified CWDB candidates, most of which are fitted with double component models for the first time. Our estimates agree with previous results for the common stars and follow the statistical distribution in the literature. The application of our code to a large volume of white dwarf binary candidates will offer important statistic samples to stellar evolution studies and future gravitational wave monitoring.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional optimisation of the scanning strategy for the LiteBIRD space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large angular scale surveys in the absence of atmosphere are essential for measuring the primordial $B$-mode power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Since this proposed measurement is about three to four orders of magnitude fainter than the temperature anisotropies of the CMB, in-flight calibration of the instruments and active suppression of systematic effects are crucial. We investigate the effect of changing the parameters of the scanning strategy on the in-flight calibration effectiveness, the suppression of the systematic effects themselves, and the ability to distinguish systematic effects by null-tests. Next-generation missions such as LiteBIRD, modulated by a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), will be able to observe polarisation using a single detector, eliminating the need to combine several detectors to measure polarisation, as done in many previous experiments and hence avoiding the consequent systematic effects. While the HWP is expected to suppress many systematic effects, some of them will remain. We use an analytical approach to comprehensively address the mitigation of these systematic effects and identify the characteristics of scanning strategies that are the most effective for implementing a variety of calibration strategies in the multi-dimensional space of common spacecraft scan parameters. We also present Falcons, a fast spacecraft scanning simulator that we developed to investigate this scanning parameter space.</description>

      <title>On the links between Astronomy, Astronomers, and Science Fiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science Fiction is using astronomy to offer to the public blockbusters at the movies (e.g. Interstellar), series or movies in streaming media (Don't Look Up, The Expanse), many books from classic authors (I. Asimov, A.C. Clarke) or more modern ones (K.S. Robinson), comics (the adventures of Valerian and Laureline), or video games (Mass Effect, No Man's sky) that have a very large cumulated audience. Astronomers can use Science Fiction to illustrate physics or astronomical facts. It might be a good way to talk about our work, our methods, by comparing them to examples with which a large audience is familiar. A few examples are provided in this contribution. In a recent study (Stanwey, 2022), it was shown that 93 percent of British professional astronomers have an interest for Science Fiction, and 69 percent consider that Science Fiction influenced their career or life choice. I am presenting a similar study made for French astronomers, performed during and just after the 2024 French astronomer meeting (Journees de la SF2A).</description>

      <title>Effect of phase noise on fringe visibility of LISA telescopes in the presence of tilt and astigmatism aberrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An in-depth analysis of GWs, LISA and its telescopes has been carried out in this paper, especially for the case in which all aberrations, except astigmatism and tilt are optimised. Though it is popular to neglect these two aberration types for their minute effect on the wavefront, a test of this negligence has been carried out in an extreme scenario of high phase noise. The relationship between phase noise and fringe visibility has been analysed, resulting in the discovery of an upper bound for allowed phase noise in LISA.</description>

      <title>A generative adversarial network for stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>The characterisation of water ice in debris discs: implications for JWST scattered light observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water ice plays a crucial role throughout the different stages of planetary evolution and is abundant in the Universe. However, its presence and nature in debris discs of exoplanetary systems are not yet strongly established observationally. In this study, we quantify and discuss the impact of ice parameters such as volume fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$, blow-out grain size, size distribution, and its phase on the observational appearance of debris discs, considering the diverse nature of these systems around stellar spectral types ranging from A to M. Our findings reveal that the prominent ice features at approximately 2.7 and 3.3\,$\mu$m depend on both the water ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ and the scattering angle, with backscattering geometries yielding the most prominent signatures. When the phase function is considered and data are not background limited, strong forward and backward scattering (near edge-on discs) are expected to yield the strongest detections in images/spectra for A or F-type stars, while scattering angle matters less for later type stars. The Fresnel peak at 3.1\,$\mu$m serves as a viable discriminant for the transitional phase (crystalline/amorphous), while simultaneously constraining the water ice temperature. For JWST imaging, we find that the F356W and F444W filter combination is most effective for constraining the grain size distribution, while the F356W and F277W filter combination provides better constraints on the ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ in debris discs. However, degeneracy between the grain size distribution and ice fraction when using photometric flux ratios means that obtaining robust constraints will likely require more than two filters, or spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>cortecs: A Python package for compressing opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absorption and emission of light by exoplanet atmospheres encode details of atmospheric composition, temperature, and dynamics. Fundamentally, simulating these processes requires detailed knowledge of the opacity of gases within an atmosphere. When modeling broad wavelength ranges at high resolution, such opacity data, for even a single gas, can take up multiple gigabytes of system random-access memory (RAM). This aspect can be a limiting factor when considering the number of gases to include in a simulation, the sampling strategy used for inference, or even the architecture of the system used for calculations. Here, we present cortecs, a Python tool for compressing opacity data. cortecs provides flexible methods for fitting the temperature, pressure, and wavelength dependencies of opacity data and for evaluating the opacity with accelerated, GPU-friendly methods. The package is actively developed on GitHub (https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs), and it is available for download with pip and conda.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Trilateration: Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Initial Orbit Determination in Low-Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increase in the number of active satellites and space debris in orbit, the problem of initial orbit determination (IOD) becomes increasingly important, demanding a high accuracy. Over the years, different approaches have been presented such as filtering methods (for example, Extended Kalman Filter), differential algebra or solving Lambert's problem. In this work, we consider a setting of three monostatic radars, where all available measurements are taken approximately at the same instant. This follows a similar setting as trilateration, a state-of-the-art approach, where each radar is able to obtain a single measurement of range and range-rate. Differently, and due to advances in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars, we assume that each location is able to obtain a larger set of range, angle and Doppler shift measurements. Thus, our method can be understood as an extension of trilateration leveraging more recent technology and incorporating additional data. We formulate the problem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which for some number of observations is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method attains the same accuracy as the trilateration method for the same number of measurements and offers an alternative and generalization, returning a more accurate estimation of the satellite's state vector, as the number of available measurements increases.</description>
