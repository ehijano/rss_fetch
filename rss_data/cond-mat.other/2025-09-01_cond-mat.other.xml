      <title>A Two-Gauge Field Model for Magnetoelectric Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a field-theoretical model designed to simulate the presence of material layers with magnetoelectric properties. The model comprises the standard Maxwell field coupled to a Chern-Simons field confined to a planar layer. The electromagnetic behavior of the boundary is emulated through the interaction between the Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields, governed by two parameters: the Chern-Simons mass and the coupling constant between the fields. Both parameters can be adjusted to reflect the specific properties of different materials. We compute the exact propagator of the theory and employ it to investigate several physical properties. Our analysis focuses on phenomena that arise from the presence of external sources coupled to both the Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields, considering various scenarios. In the Chern-Simons sector, the sources emulate defects in the crystal lattice of the material layer. The main objective of this paper is to present the proposed model and to explore its behavior in the simple context of a single planar material interface. We also suggest possible extensions of the model to more general configurations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport Anomalies of Electrolyte Solutions in the Water Supercooled Regime: Signatures of the Liquid-Liquid Water Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water exhibits remarkable anomalies when supercooled, attributed to a hypothesized liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between low-density (LDL) and high-density (HDL) liquid phases. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we explore thermal transport and coupled effects in supercooled NaCl and LiCl solutions (1-4 m, 200-300 K). At 1 m, thermal conductivity exhibits a pronounced minimum near 220 K, coinciding with maxima in isothermal compressibility and minima in the speed of sound, both of which are signatures of critical fluctuations. The anomalies progressively diminish with increasing salt concentration and vanish at 4 m, suggesting suppression of the LLPT. The Soret coefficient exhibits a striking behavior. Initially thermophobic at high temperatures (&gt; 280 K), becoming thermophilic upon cooling, then reverting to thermophobic below 220 K. This behavior correlates with structural changes in the hydrogen-bond network of water. Specifically, we find that electrolyte solutions dominated by HDL structures, which are characterized by lower tetrahedral order, exhibit thermophobic behavior, whereas thermodynamic states dominated by LDL structures, with higher tetrahedral order, display thermophilic behavior. Furthermore, Seebeck coefficients exhibit sign reversals near 220-230 K, highlighting the thermoelectric sensitivity to structural transformations and temperature. These findings establish thermal transport as a sensitive probe of supercooled water, revealing that electrolyte solutions preserve the water's anomalies deep into the supercooled regime.</description>

      <title>Towards a multi-dimensional picture of nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) often fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Characteristic determinant approach to the spectrum of one-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric superlattice systems with complex potentials of periodic sets of two $\delta$-potentials in the elementary cell. In the presence of periodic gain and loss we analyzed in detail a diatomic crystal model, varying either the scatterer distances or the potential heights. It is shown that at a certain critical value of the imaginary part of the complex amplitude, topological states depending on the lattice size and the configuration of the unit cell can disappear. This may happened at the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking (exceptional) points.</description>

      <title>Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>
