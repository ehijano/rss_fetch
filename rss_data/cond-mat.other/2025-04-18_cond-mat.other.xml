      <title>Phase field model of Coulomb explosion damage in solid induced by ultrashort laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion, electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Topolectrical circuits $-$ recent experimental advances and developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>
