      <title>An Overview and Comparison of Axiomatization Structures Regarding Inconsistency Indices' Properties in Pairwise Comparisons Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical analysis of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) led to the development of a mathematical function, usually called the inconsistency index, which has the center role in measuring the inconsistency of the judgements in AHP. Inconsistency index is a mathematical function which maps every pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) into a real number. An inconsistency index can be considered more trustworthy when it satisfies a set of suitable properties. Therefore, the research community has been trying to postulate a set of desirable rules (axioms, properties) for inconsistency indices. Subsequently, many axiomatic frameworks for these functions have been suggested independently, however, the literature on the topic is fragmented and missing a broader framework. Therefore, the objective of this article is twofold. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of the advancements in the axiomatization of inconsistency indices' properties during the last decade. Secondly, we provide a comparison and discussion of the aforementioned axiomatic structures along with directions of the future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Automatic Linearization via SMT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical optimization is ubiquitous in modern applications. However, in practice, we often need to use nonlinear optimization models, for which the existing optimization tools such as Cplex or Gurobi may not be directly applicable and an (error-prone) manual transformation often has to be done. Thus, to address this issue, in this paper we investigate the problem of automatically verifying and synthesizing reductions, the solution of which may allow an automatic linearization of nonlinear models. We show that the synthesis of reductions can be formulated as an $\exists^* \forall^*$ synthesis problem, which can be solved by an SMT solver via the counter-example guided inductive synthesis approach (CEGIS).</description>

      <title>Model-checking positive equality free logic on a fixed structure (direttissima)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new, direct proof of the tetrachotomy classification for the model-checking problem of positive equality-free logic parameterised by the model. The four complexity classes are Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete and Pspace-complete. The previous proof of this result relied on notions from universal algebra and core-like structures called U-X-cores. This new proof uses only relations, and works for infinite structures also in the distinction between Logspace and NP-hard under Turing reductions.
  For finite domains, the membership in NP and co-NP follows from a simple argument, which breaks down already over an infinite set with a binary relation. We develop some interesting new algorithms to solve NP and co-NP membership for a variety of infinite structures. We begin with those first-order definable in (Q;=), the so-called equality languages, then move to those first-order definable in (Q;&lt;), the so-called temporal languages. However, it is first-order expansions of the Random Graph (V,E) that provide the most interesting examples. In all of these cases, the derived classification is a tetrachotomy between Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete and Pspace-complete.</description>

      <title>Logic interpretations of ANN partition cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a binary classification problem solved using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). Let the ANN be composed of a ReLU layer and several linear layers (convolution, sum-pooling, or fully connected). We assume the network was trained with high accuracy. Despite numerous suggested approaches, interpreting an artificial neural network remains challenging for humans. For a new method of interpretation, we construct a bridge between a simple ANN and logic. As a result, we can analyze and manipulate the semantics of an ANN using the powerful tool set of logic. To achieve this, we decompose the input space of the ANN into several network partition cells. Each network partition cell represents a linear combination that maps input values to a classifying output value. For interpreting the linear map of a partition cell using logic expressions, we suggest minterm values as the input of a simple ANN. We derive logic expressions representing interaction patterns for separating objects classified as 1 from those classified as 0. To facilitate an interpretation of logic expressions, we present them as binary logic trees.</description>

      <title>Temporal Ensemble Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Temporal Ensemble Logic (TEL), a monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning. TEL includes primitive temporal constructs such as ``always up to $t$ time later'' ($\Box_t$), ``sometimes before $t$ time in the future'' ($\Diamond_t$), and ``$t$-time later'' $\varphi_t$. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and reproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and population health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in biomedicine. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up, with discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical development of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers $\mathbb{N}^+$, denoted as ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$ is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic second order logic, characterized by B\"{u}chi automata. We present its formal semantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the satisfiability of ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. We also discuss expressiveness and decidability fragments for ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$, followed by illustrative applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Winning Strategies: Admissible and Admissible Winning Strategies for Quantitative Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical reactive synthesis approaches aim to synthesize a reactive system that always satisfies a given specifications. These approaches often reduce to playing a two-player zero-sum game where the goal is to synthesize a winning strategy. However, in many pragmatic domains, such as robotics, a winning strategy does not always exist, yet it is desirable for the system to make an effort to satisfy its requirements instead of "giving up". To this end, this paper investigates the notion of admissible strategies, which formalize "doing-your-best", in quantitative reachability games. We show that, unlike the qualitative case, quantitative admissible strategies are history-dependent even for finite payoff functions, making synthesis a challenging task. In addition, we prove that admissible strategies always exist but may produce undesirable optimistic behaviors. To mitigate this, we propose admissible winning strategies, which enforce the best possible outcome while being admissible. We show that both strategies always exist but are not memoryless. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both strategies and propose synthesis algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the strategies on gridworld and robot manipulator domains.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Quantifier Selection in cvc5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we considerably improve the state-of-the-art SMT solving on first-order quantified problems by efficient machine learning guidance of quantifier selection. Quantifiers represent a significant challenge for SMT and are technically a source of undecidability. In our approach, we train an efficient machine learning model that informs the solver which quantifiers should be instantiated and which not. Each quantifier may be instantiated multiple times and the set of the active quantifiers changes as the solving progresses. Therefore, we invoke the ML predictor many times, during the whole run of the solver. To make this efficient, we use fast ML models based on gradient boosting decision trees. We integrate our approach into the state-of-the-art cvc5 SMT solver and show a considerable increase of the system's holdout-set performance after training it on a large set of first-order problems collected from the Mizar Mathematical Library.</description>

      <title>Precision on Demand: Propositional Logic for Event-Trigger Threshold Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel event-trigger threshold (ETT) regulation mechanism based on the quantitative semantics of propositional logic (PL). We exploit the expressiveness of the PL vocabulary to deliver a precise and flexible specification of ETT regulation based on system requirements and properties. Additionally, we present a modified ETT regulation mechanism that provides formal guarantees for satisfaction/violation detection of arbitrary PL properties. To validate our proposed method, we consider a convoy of vehicles in an adaptive cruise control scenario. In this scenario, the PL operators are used to encode safety properties and the ETTs are regulated accordingly, e.g., if our safety metric is high there can be a higher ETT threshold, while a smaller threshold is used when the system is approaching unsafe conditions. Under ideal ETT regulation conditions in this safety scenario, we show that reductions between 41.8 - 96.3% in the number of triggered events is possible compared to using a constant ETT while maintaining similar safety conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the epimorphisms in homotopy type theory (HoTT) as the fiberwise acyclic maps and develop a type-theoretic treatment of acyclic maps and types in the context of synthetic homotopy theory as developed in univalent foundations. We present examples and applications in group theory, such as the acyclicity of the Higman group, through the identification of groups with 0-connected, pointed 1-types. Many of our results are formalized as part of the agda-unimath library.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithmic framework for Three-valued Abstraction Refinement, which extends Counterexample-guided Abstraction Refinement with the ability to verify all properties of mu-calculus including recovery (the ability of the system to always return to a certain state). The framework performs refinement on abstract system inputs rather than abstract states, avoiding problems of previous frameworks. We formalise input-based refinement by introducing the concept of generating automata, and prove that our framework is sound, monotone, and complete. We evaluate the usefulness of the framework on its implementation in our free and open-source formal verification tool.</description>

      <title>On the ABK Conjecture, alpha-well Quasi Orders and Dress-Schiffels product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following is a 2008 conjecture of Abraham, Bonnet and Kubi\'s: [ABK Conjecture] Every well quasi order (wqo) is a countable union of better quasi orders (bqo). We obtain a partial progress on the conjecture, by showing that the class of orders that are a countable union of better quasi orders (sigma-bqo) is closed under various operations. These include diverse products, such as the Dress-Shieffels product. We develop various properties of the latter product. In relation with the main question, we explore the class of alpha-wqo for countable ordinals alpha and obtain several closure properties and a Hausdorff-style classification theorem. Our main contribution is the discovery of various properties of sigma-bqos and ruling out potential counterexamples to the ABK Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a datalog query evaluation approach based on efficient and composable boolean matrix manipulation modules. We first define an overarching problem, Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP), which uses boolean matrices as an alternative computation to evaluate datalog programs. We develop two novel BMLP modules for bottom-up inferences on linear dyadic recursive datalog programs, and show how additional modules can extend this capability to compute both linear and non-linear recursive datalog programs of arity two. Our empirical results demonstrate that these modules outperform general-purpose and specialised systems by factors of 30x and 9x, respectively, when evaluating large programs with millions of facts. This boolean matrix approach significantly enhances the efficiency of datalog querying to support logic programming techniques.</description>
