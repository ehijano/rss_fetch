      <title>A genome-scale deep learning model to predict gene expression changes of genetic perturbations from multiplex biological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic characterization of biological effects to genetic perturbation is essential to the application of molecular biology and biomedicine. However, the experimental exhaustion of genetic perturbations on the genome-wide scale is challenging. Here, we show that TranscriptionNet, a deep learning model that integrates multiple biological networks to systematically predict transcriptional profiles to three types of genetic perturbations based on transcriptional profiles induced by genetic perturbations in the L1000 project: RNA interference (RNAi), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and overexpression (OE). TranscriptionNet performs better than existing approaches in predicting inducible gene expression changes for all three types of genetic perturbations. TranscriptionNet can predict transcriptional profiles for all genes in existing biological networks and increases perturbational gene expression changes for each type of genetic perturbation from a few thousand to 26,945 genes. TranscriptionNet demonstrates strong generalization ability when comparing predicted and true gene expression changes on different external tasks. Overall, TranscriptionNet can systemically predict transcriptional consequences induced by perturbing genes on a genome-wide scale and thus holds promise to systemically detect gene function and enhance drug development and target discovery.</description>

      <title>CRISPR: Ensemble Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a gene editing technology that has revolutionized the fields of biology and medicine. However, one of the challenges of using CRISPR is predicting the on-target efficacy and off-target sensitivity of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). This is because most existing methods are trained on separate datasets with different genes and cells, which limits their generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning method for sgRNA design that is accurate and generalizable. Our method combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models to produce a single, more robust prediction. This approach allows us to learn from a wider range of data, which improves the generalizability of our model. We evaluated our method on a benchmark dataset of sgRNA designs and found that it outperformed existing methods in terms of both accuracy and generalizability. Our results suggest that our method can be used to design sgRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity, even for new genes or cells. This could have important implications for the clinical use of CRISPR, as it would allow researchers to design more effective and safer treatments for a variety of diseases.</description>

      <title>scDiffusion: conditional generation of high-quality single-cell data using diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are important for studying the laws of life at single-cell level. However, it is still challenging to obtain enough high-quality scRNA-seq data. To mitigate the limited availability of data, generative models have been proposed to computationally generate synthetic scRNA-seq data. Nevertheless, the data generated with current models are not very realistic yet, especially when we need to generate data with controlled conditions. In the meantime, the Diffusion models have shown their power in generating data at high fidelity, providing a new opportunity for scRNA-seq generation.
  In this study, we developed scDiffusion, a generative model combining diffusion model and foundation model to generate high-quality scRNA-seq data with controlled conditions. We designed multiple classifiers to guide the diffusion process simultaneously, enabling scDiffusion to generate data under multiple condition combinations. We also proposed a new control strategy called Gradient Interpolation. This strategy allows the model to generate continuous trajectories of cell development from a given cell state.
  Experiments showed that scDiffusion can generate single-cell gene expression data closely resembling real scRNA-seq data. Also, scDiffusion can conditionally produce data on specific cell types including rare cell types. Furthermore, we could use the multiple-condition generation of scDiffusion to generate cell type that was out of the training data. Leveraging the Gradient Interpolation strategy, we generated a continuous developmental trajectory of mouse embryonic cells. These experiments demonstrate that scDiffusion is a powerful tool for augmenting the real scRNA-seq data and can provide insights into cell fate research.</description>
