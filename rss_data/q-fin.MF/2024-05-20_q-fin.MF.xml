      <title>Deep Penalty Methods: A Class of Deep Learning Algorithms for Solving High Dimensional Optimal Stopping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning algorithm for high dimensional optimal stopping problems. Our method is inspired by the penalty method for solving free boundary PDEs. Within our approach, the penalized PDE is approximated using the Deep BSDE framework proposed by \cite{weinan2017deep}, which leads us to coin the term "Deep Penalty Method (DPM)" to refer to our algorithm. We show that the error of the DPM can be bounded by the loss function and $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})+O(\lambda h) +O(\sqrt{h})$, where $h$ is the step size in time and $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration when selecting the penalization parameter and suggests that the discretization error converges at a rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$. We validate the efficacy of the DPM through numerical tests conducted on a high-dimensional optimal stopping model in the area of American option pricing. The numerical tests confirm both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Risk-neutral valuation of options under arithmetic Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On April 22, 2020, the CME Group switched to Bachelier pricing for a group of oil futures options. The Bachelier model, or more generally the arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM), is not so widely used in finance, though. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of options pricing under ABM. Using the risk-neutral valuation, we derive formulas for European options for three underlying types, namely an underlying that does not pay dividends, an underlying that pays a continuous dividend yield, and futures. Further, we derive Black-Scholes-Merton-like partial differential equations, which can in principle be utilized to price American options numerically via finite difference.</description>

      <title>Risk, utility and sensitivity to large losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk and utility functionals are fundamental building blocks in economics and finance. In this paper we investigate under which conditions a risk or utility functional is sensitive to the accumulation of losses in the sense that any sufficiently large multiple of a position that exposes an agent to future losses has positive risk or negative utility. We call this property sensitivity to large losses and provide necessary and sufficient conditions thereof that are easy to check for a very large class of risk and utility functionals. In particular, our results do not rely on convexity and can therefore also be applied to most examples discussed in the recent literature, including (non-convex) star-shaped risk measures or S-shaped utility functions encountered in prospect theory. As expected, Value at Risk generally fails to be sensitive to large losses. More surprisingly, this is also true of Expected Shortfall. By contrast, expected utility functionals as well as (optimized) certainty equivalents are proved to be sensitive to large losses for many standard choices of concave and nonconcave utility functions, including $S$-shaped utility functions. We also show that Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall become sensitive to large losses if they are either properly adjusted or if the property is suitably localized.</description>

      <title>$\rho$-arbitrage and $\rho$-consistent pricing for star-shaped risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits mean-risk portfolio selection in a one-period financial market, where risk is quantified by a star-shaped risk measure $\rho$. We make three contributions. First, we introduce the new axiom of sensitivity to large expected losses and show that it is key to ensure the existence of optimal portfolios. Second, we give primal and dual characterisations of (strong) $\rho$-arbitrage. Finally, we use our conditions for the absence of (strong) $\rho$-arbitrage to explicitly derive the (strong) $\rho$-consistent price interval for an external financial contract.</description>
