      <title>High-Pass Filtering and Gaussian Process Regularization: Stellar Activity Characterization Techniques Applied to the 55 Cancri Planetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler planet searches are complicated by stellar activity, through which cyclical changes in the host star's photosphere and chromosphere can mask or mimic planetary signals. A popular technique for modeling stellar activity is to apply a quasiperiodic Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which provides a flexible model with rigorous error propagation. However, observers must guard against overfitting, as a GP may be flexible enough to subsume other signals besides the one it is intended to model. To counteract overfitting, we introduce a curvature-penalizing objective function for fitting GP models to long-term magnetic activity cycles. We also demonstrate that a Gaussian filter can be an effective method of detrending radial velocities (RVs) so that shorter-period signals can be extracted even in the absence of a mathematical model of the long-term trend. We apply our methods to the heavily studied 55 Cancri system, fitting Keplerian orbits plus the GP activity-cycle model. We show that a 4-Keplerian model that includes planets b, c, e, and f combined with a GP for the activity cycle performs at least as well as the widely agreed-upon 5-planet system with its own GP activity model. Our results suggest that the existence of planet d cannot be established from the RVs alone; additional data are required for confirmation.</description>

      <title>Volcanic Satellites Tidally Venting Na, K, SO2 in Optical &amp; Infrared Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent infrared spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spurred analyses of common volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), alongside alkali metals sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) surrounding the hot Saturn WASP-39 b. We report more than an order-of-magnitude of variability in the density of neutral Na, K, and SO2 between ground-based measurements and JWST, at distinct epochs, hinting at exogenic physical processes similar to those sourcing Io's extended atmosphere and torus. Tidally-heated volcanic satellite simulations sputtering gas into a cloud or toroid orbiting the planet, are able to reproduce the probed line-of-sight column density variations. The estimated SO2 flux is consistent with tidal gravitation predictions, with a Na/SO2 ratio far smaller than Io's. Although stable satellite orbits at this system are known to be &lt; 15.3 hours, several high-resolution alkali Doppler shift observations are required to constrain a putative orbit. Due to the Roche limit interior to the planetary photosphere at ~ 8 hours, atmosphere-exosphere interactions are expected to be especially important at this system.</description>

      <title>MasconCube: Fast and Accurate Gravity Modeling with an Explicit Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations, MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions of irregular celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Constraining Brown Dwarf Desert Formation Mechanisms Through Statistical Comparison of Observed and Simulated Orbital Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of brown dwarf companions to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed "brown dwarf desert", the notable paucity of brown dwarf companions, at orbital separations between 0.1 and 5 AU. Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and orbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three proposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias through dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models. The disk migration model provides the best statistical fit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal parameters {\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The formation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value = 0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion scenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\times}10^-17) despite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: The Occurrence of Giant Planets orbiting M-dwarfs within 100 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P &lt; 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100\,pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds.
  We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\% \pm 0.047\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\% \pm 0.032\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample. We note that while our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 10.0$ days, these occurrence rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 5.0$ days. This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.</description>

      <title>Prediscovery Activity of New Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: A Dynamically-Old Comet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the prediscovery observations and constraints of the new interstellar comet 3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS), made by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), for the inbound leg of the comet out to a heliocentric distance of $r_\mathrm{h}=17$ au, or approximately a year before its discovery. We find that 3I/ATLAS has been active inward of a heliocentric distance of at least $r_\mathrm{h}=6.5$ au. The comet followed a brightening rate of $\propto r_\mathrm{h}^{-3.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the only other known interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, and is more consistent with dynamically old long-period comets and short-period comets in the Solar System. By measuring the brightening of the dust coma, we estimate that 3I had a dust production rate of $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim5 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ in early May of 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim6$ au), increasing to $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim30 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ towards mid-July 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim4$ au) assuming 100 micron dust grains, in line with the more recent Hubble Space Telescope measurement made at $r_\mathrm{h}=3.8$ au. Comparison with the prediscovery photometry by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) suggested that 3I started producing constant dust outflow probably around $r_\mathrm{h}\sim9$ au, coinciding with the turn-on distance of CO$_2$ ice. We also conduct a deep search of 3I/ATLAS with multiple nights of data taken in 2024 when the comet was at $r_\mathrm{h}=13$-$17$ au and conclude that the comet was no brighter than 2-5 magnitudes above the coma or bare-nucleus lightcurves. This suggests that the comet did not exhibit strong outbursts during these periods, consistent with 2I/Borisov as well as most long-period Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>A Planetary Cooling Hose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geoengineering may offer a way to pause global warming, providing the time for more permanent solutions to become effective. Erection of a high-altitude hose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing fluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar radiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude of 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the form of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed out at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to perform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to deliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from a single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough to test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites across the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.
  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid and the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose requires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose walls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a suite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length as well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not dealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will collapse the hose. The wide hoses needed to deliver gaseous H$_2$S are particularly susceptible to wind, so must be enclosed within lightweight aero-shrouds to reduce wind forces.
  After treating the design of these two hoses, we lay out the steps needed to develop and fabricate them, and conclude with some thoughts on how the hoses might be fielded.</description>

      <title>spherical: A Comprehensive Database and Automated Pipeline for VLT/SPHERE High-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present spherical (https://github.com/m-samland/spherical), a software package and database designed for the ESO VLT/SPHERE high-contrast imager. SPHERE has produced the world's largest archive of direct imaging observations of exoplanets and circumstellar disks, but its heterogeneous metadata and fragmented reduction tools make end-to-end analysis labor-intensive. spherical addresses this by combining (1) a curated, regularly updated, and searchable database of all SPHERE observations, cross-matched with stellar properties and observing conditions, and (2) a Python-based, script-driven pipeline for the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). The database, archived on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15147730) and reproducible from the ESO archive, currently includes about 6000 IRDIS dual-band imaging, about 1000 IRDIS polarimetric, and about 4500 IFS sequences, with additional modes (ZIMPOL, IRDIS-LSS, SAM) planned. The pipeline automates raw data retrieval, calibration, and IFS reduction with the adapted open-source CHARIS instrument pipeline, followed by astrometric and photometric calibration and post-processing with TRAP for companion detection and spectral extraction. spherical lowers the barrier from raw files to science-ready products, enabling homogeneous population studies, atmospheric characterization of companions, and efficient survey follow-up, while remaining interoperable with community tools such as VIP, pyKLIP, and IRDAP.</description>

      <title>Modeling Low-Temperature Plasmas Simulating Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study presented here, we model the gas phase chemistry induced by plasma discharge at low temperature (150 K) in the NASA Ames COSmIC Simulation Chamber (COSmIC) using a 1-dimensional multi-fluid plasma model named CO-PRISM (COSmIC Plasma Reactivity and Ionization Simulation Model). Our model incorporates an extensive chemical reaction network to simulate the neutral-neutral and ion-neutral reactions occurring in the COSmIC experiments when using N2-CH4-based gas mixtures relevant to Titan's atmosphere. Our reaction network now includes crucial reactions involving the first electronically-excited state of atomic nitrogen, recent electron collision cross-sections, and radical chemistry. In particular, we have investigated the influence of C2H2 on the gas phase polymeric growth and the elemental composition of the chemical products, and we have compared our findings to recently published solid phase analyses. The modeling results are consistent with experimental measurements of N2-CH4-C2H2 plasmas on COSmIC, showing the production of C6Hx intermediates and precursors of larger organics, as well as methanimine in small concentration. Our numerical results point to cationic pathways enabling efficient intermediate-sized and nitrogen-rich \ce{C2H2}-driven chemistry driving tholin production. Comparison of the modeled gas phase elemental composition with elemental composition of the solid phase samples produced in COSmIC reveal similar trends, with C/N increasing when C2H2 is present in the gas mixture. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of such synergistic studies using low-temperature plasma chemistry experiments combined with modeling efforts to improve our understanding of cold planetary environments.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Mid-IR Direct Imaging: The Origin of the Thermal Background on the Keck II Telescope and Correcting Instrumental Systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-IR wavelengths are of particular interest to exoplanet science due to the fact they can extend the searchable parameter space to planets that are older and/or colder. However, a significant source of uncertainty at mid-IR wavelengths on ground-based telescopes is the thermal background. This background comes from blackbody radiation in the atmosphere and telescope and is therefore dependent on instrument design and atmospheric conditions. When performing imaging observations, this background manifests as a slowly varying, inhomogeneous signal throughout the image, underlying our data. Photometry at mid-IR can greatly constrain atmospheric models but existing data are usually scarce or have significant error bars due to the difficulty of subtracting the background. Using M-band direct imaging observing sequences on NIRC2, we evaluate the thermal background of the Keck II telescope and attempt to subtract the background in a more comprehensive way. For our primary science target, the forming protoplanet AB Aur b, we present a contrast upper limit of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ in M-band and address the limiting factors in our observation due to the thermal background. We determine that the origin of the systematic components of the thermal background comes from the K-mirror and find that the thermal background is also strongly influenced by emission from the secondary spiders on Keck II.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary disks around magnetized young stars with large-scale magnetic fields I: Steady-state solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing the large-scale field topology of protoplanetary disks faces significant difficulties and uncertainties. The transport of the large-scale field inside the disk plays an important role in understanding its evolution. We aim to improve our understanding of the dependencies that stellar magnetic fields pose on the large-scale field. We focus on the innermost disk region ($\lesssim$ 0.1 AU), which is crucial for understanding the long-term disk evolution. We present a novel approach combining the evolution of a 1+1D hydrodynamic disk with a large-scale magnetic field, consisting of a stellar dipole truncating the disk and a fossil field. The magnetic flux transport includes advection and diffusion due to laminar, non-ideal MHD effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. Due to the implicit nature of the numerical method, long-term simulations (in the order of several viscous timescales) are feasible. The large-scale magnetic field topology in stationary models shows a distinct dependence on specific parameters. The innermost disk region is strongly affected by the stellar rotation period and magnetic field strength. The outer disk regions are affected by the X-ray luminosity and the fossil field. Varying the mass flow through the disk affects the large-scale disk field throughout its radial extent. The topology of the large-scale disk field is affected by several stellar and disk parameters. This will affect the efficiency of MHD outflows, which depend on the magnetic field topology. Such outflows might originate from the very inner disk region, the dead zone, or the outer disk. In subsequent studies, we will use these models as a starting point for conducting long-term evolution simulations of the disk and large-scale field on scales of $\sim$ 106 years to investigate the combined evolution of the disk, the magnetic field topology, and the resulting MHD outflows.</description>

Abstract: Titan, with its thick and hazy atmosphere, is a key world in our solar system for understanding light scattering processes. NASA's Cassini mission monitored Titan between 2004 and 2017, where the derived dataset includes a large number of whole disk observations. Once spatially integrated, these whole disk observations reveal Titan's phase-dependent brightness which can serve as an analog for how hazy worlds might appear around other stars. To explore Titan's phase curve, we present a pipeline for whole disk Titan observations acquired by the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spanning 0.9--5.1 $\mu$m. Application of the pipeline finds over 4,400 quality spatially- and spectrally-resolved datacubes that were then integrated over Titan's disk to yield phase curves spanning 2\degree--165\degree in phase angle. Spectra at near-full phase provide a useful approximation for Titan's geometric albedo, thus extending the spectral coverage of previous work. Crescent phase brightness enhancements in the Cassini VIMS phase curves are often more extreme than analogous results seen at optical wavelengths, which can be explained by atmospheric transparency and haze scattering processes. These results provide validation opportunities for exoplanet-focused spectral models and also shed light on how extreme aerosol forward scattering could influence exoplanet observations and interpretations.</description>

      <title>JWST detection of a carbon dioxide dominated gas coma surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $7.6\pm0.3$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.5-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>

      <title>Detailed Microwave Continuum Spectra from Bright Protoplanetary Disks in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\alpha_{\rm c} \approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\alpha_{\rm d} \approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\approx 1000 \, M_\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.</description>
