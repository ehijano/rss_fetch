      <title>Electro-optic properties from ab initio calculations in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) effects relate the change of optical constants by low-frequency electric fields. Thanks to the advent of Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT), the EO properties of bulk three-dimensional (3D) materials can now be calculated in an ab initio way. However, the use of periodic boundary conditions in most Density Functional Theory codes imposes to simulate two-dimensional (2D) materials using slabs surrounded by a large layer of vacuum. The EO coefficients predicted from such calculations, if not rescaled properly, can severely deviate from the real EO properties of 2D materials. The present work discusses the issue and introduces the rescaling relationships allowing to recover the true EO properties.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Time-Resolved Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale carrier dynamics induced by light excitation is the key to unlocking futuristic devices and innovative functionalities in advanced materials. Optical pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (OPP-STM) has opened a window to these phenomena. However, mastering the combination of ultrafast pulsed lasers with STM requires high expertise and effort. We have shattered this barrier and developed a compact OPP-STM system accessible to all. This system precisely controls laser pulse timing electrically and enables stable laser irradiation on sample surfaces. Furthermore, by applying this technique to atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have captured time-resolved force signals with an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio. Originating from the dipole-dipole interactions, these signals provide insights into the carrier dynamics on sample surfaces, which are activated by photo-illumination. These technologies are promising as powerful tools for exploring a wide range of photoinduced phenomena in conductive and insulating materials.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chemical Ordering in High Entropy Materials: A Machine Learning-Accelerated High-throughput Cluster Expansion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cluster Expansion (CE) Method encounters significant computational challenges in multicomponent systems due to the computational expense of generating training data through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work aims to refine the cluster and structure selection processes to mitigate these challenges. We introduce a novel method that significantly reduces the computational load associated with the calculation of fitting parameters. This method employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, leveraging the M3GNet network, which is trained using a select subset of DFT calculations at each ionic step. The trained surrogate model excels in predicting the volume and energy of the final structure for a relaxation run. By employing this model, we sample thousands of structures and fit a CE model to the energies of these GNN-relaxed structures. This approach, utilizing a large training dataset, effectively reduces the risk of overfitting, yielding a CE model with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 10 meV/atom. We validate our method's effectiveness in two test cases: the (Cr,Hf,Mo,Ta,Ti,Zr)B$_2$ diboride system and the Refractory High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) AlHfNbTaTiZr system. Our findings demonstrate the significant advantages of integrating a GNN model, specifically the M3GNet network, with CE methods for the efficient predictive analysis of chemical ordering in High Entropy Materials. The accelerating capabilities of the hybrid ML-CE approach to investigate the evolution of Short Range Ordering (SRO) in a large number of stoichiometric systems. Finally, we show how it is possible to correlate the strength of chemical ordering to easily accessible alloy parameters.</description>

      <title>Broad-band ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of YAlO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broad band (THz to UV) ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of the orthorhombic perovskite YAlO3. The ellipsometric measurements have been performed on YAlO3 crystals with three different surface cuts and for six high symmetry configurations of the crystal axes with respect to the plane of incidence of the photons. The obtained data are presented in terms of the Mueller Matrix elements N, C, and S and their features are analyzed and discussed with respect to the anisotropy of the dielectric response tensor. In particular, in the infrared range we have identified all 25 infrared active phonon modes that have been predicted from theoretical studies. We also discuss a negative refraction effect that naturally occurs in the vicinity of an anisotropic longitudinal-optical phonon. Moreover, we have determined the temperature dependence of the phonon parameters between 10 and 330 K. The dielectric response above the phonon range, from about 0.1 to 6.5 eV, is shown to be featureless and characteristic of an insulator with a large band gap above 6.5 eV and is well described by anisotropic Cauchy model.</description>

      <title>Coherent Collections of Rules Describing Exceptional Materials Identified with a Multi-Objective Optimization of Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a modest amount of data from a large population, subgroup discovery (SGD) identifies outstanding subsets of data with respect to a certain property of interest of that population. The SGs are described by "rules". These are constraints on key descriptive parameters that characterize the material or the environment. These parameters and constraints are obtained by maximizing a quality function that establishes a tradeoff between SG size and utility, i.e., between generality and exceptionality. The utility function measures how outstanding a SG is. However, this approach does not give a unique solution, but typically many SGs have similar quality-function values. Here, we identify coherent collections of SGs of a "Pareto region" presenting various size-utility tradeoffs and define a SG similarity measure based on the Jaccard index, which allows us to hierarchically cluster these optimal SGs. These concepts are demonstrated by learning rules that describe perovskites with high bulk modulus. We show that SGs focusing on exceptional materials exhibit a high quality-function value but do not necessarily maximize it. We compare the mean shift with the cumulative Jensen-Shannon divergence ($D_{sJS}$) as utility functions and show that the SG rules obtained with $D_{cJS}$ are more focused than those obtained with the mean shift.</description>

      <title>Physics and data driven model for prediction of residual stresses in machining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting residual stresses has always been a topic of significance due to its implications in the development of enhanced materials and better processing conditions. In this work, an analytical model for prediction of residual stresses is developed for orthogonal machining. It consists of three component models for force, temperature and stress computation. The Oxley force model and Waldorf's slip-line model are employed for obtaining cutting force, thrust force, and temperatures at the shear zone and tool-chip interface for the given parameters. The Komanduri-Hou two heat source model is used for obtaining the temperature distribution in the workpiece. The effect of coolant with differing mass flow rates has also been incorporated. The residual stresses are obtained by combining the mechanical and thermal components, followed by the loading and relaxation of the stresses. Optimal values for unknown parameters are predicted by leveraging a cost function. The residual stress distributions obtained give a tensile region near the surface for Inconel 718, and a compressive region for Ti6Al4V, which are in line with experimental results found in literature.</description>

      <title>Record cryogenic cooling in ferroelectric hafnia proximity induced via Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip refrigeration at cryogenic temperatures is becoming an important requirement in the context of quantum technologies and nanoelectronics. Ferroic materials with enhanced electrocaloric effects at phase transitions are good material candidates for the same. By exploiting the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) of TiOx(Ny), the bottom electrode, we engineer a depolarization field controlled reversible polar to non-polar phase transition in thick La-doped hafnia (40 nm). This transition occurs between ~125 and 140 K and produces giant negative pyroelectric and electrocaloric effects. Refrigeration metrics were estimated between 120 to 200 K, with a peak refrigerant capacity of 25 kJ Kg-1 (2 kJ Kg-1), peak isothermal entropy {\Delta}S~ 8 kJ Kg-1 K-1 (0.5 kJ Kg-1 K-1) and adiabatic {\Delta}Tcooling ~ 106 K (11 K) at ~140 K and 5 MV cm-1 (0.5 MV cm-1, and these are the largest reported in any electrocaloric system. Our work fundamentally proposes design guidelines to induce significant solid-state refrigeration through proximity effects, even at cryogenic temperatures relevant to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Octahedral and polar phase transitions in freestanding films of SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From extreme strain to bending, the possibilities in the manipulation of freestanding films of oxide perovskites bring a novel landscape to their properties and brings them one step closer to their application. It is therefore of great importance to fully understand the inherent properties of such films, in which dimensionality and surface effects can play a major role in defining the properties of the materials ground state. This paper reports the properties of freestanding (FS) films of the canonical oxide, SrTiO3 (STO) with thicknesses 20, 30, 40 and 80 nm. We show that the relaxed ultrathin STO FS films become polar at temperatures as high as 85 K, in contrast to the quantum paraelectric behavior of bulk. Our findings are based on the softening of the ferroelectric mode towards the ferroelectric transition temperature Tc and its consecutive hardening below Tc with further decreasing temperature, probed with THz time domain spectroscopy in transmission mode. We find almost no thickness dependence in Tc. Moreover, we characterize the antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition in STO FS by X-ray diffraction (XRD) probing superlattice reflections characteristic for the rotation of the TiO6 octahedra. Our results point to a higher phase transition temperature in comparison to bulk STO, as well as an unbalanced domain population favoring the rotation axis to be in plane. X-ray linear dichroism results further show a preferential Ti xz/yz orbital occupancy at the surface, but with a complete degeneracy in the t2g states in the inner part of the film indicating that the AFD distortion does not strongly affect the t2g splitting. These findings demonstrate that STO FS films have clearly different properties than bulk.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Peridynamic Neural Operators: Discover Biotissue Constitutive Law and Microstructure From Digital Image Correlation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human tissues are highly organized structures with specific collagen fiber arrangements varying from point to point. The effects of such heterogeneity play an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to discover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from experimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this end, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO) approach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic materials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation field, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we propose a two-phase learning approach. Firstly, we learn a homogeneous constitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a nonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from data. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the kernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for each material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our HeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear and angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and nonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the bond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability. As a result, our HeteroPNO architecture can learn a constitutive model for a biological tissue with anisotropic heterogeneous response undergoing large deformation regime. Moreover, the framework is capable to provide displacement and stress field predictions for new and unseen loading instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated device of a perovskite solar cell with a Li-ion battery is an innovative solution for decentralized energy storage in smart electronic devices. In this study, we examine the stability of Li ions intercalated in a CsPbI$_3$ perovskite and their effect on the electronic structure of Li$_x$CsPbI$_3$ compounds using first-principles density functional theory. Our simulations demonstrate that the insertion of Li at concentrations up to $x$ = 1 into CsPbI$_3$ is energetically possible. Moreover, we identify that the distortion of the Pb-I octahedra has the strongest impact on the change in the electronic band gap. Specifically, an increase in the amount of intercalated Li causes larger structural distortions, which in turn lead to an increasing band gap as function of the Li content.</description>

      <title>Ferroelastic control of magnetic domain structure: direct imaging by Magnetic Force Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrrhotite, Fe$_7$S$_8$, provides an example of exceptionally strong magnetoelastic coupling through pinning of ferromagnetic domains by ferroelastic twins. Using direct imaging of both magnetic and ferroelastic domains by magnetic force microscopy (MFM), the mechanism by which this coupling controls local magnetic switching behaviour of regions on the pyrrhotite surface is revealed, and leads to quantitative fitting of field dependent MFM phase shifts with bulk magnetometry data. It is shown that characteristic inflection points in the magnetometry data along certain direction, in particular $[\overline 120]^*_h$ of the hexagonal parent structure, are in fact caused by ferroelastic pinning of the magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Loss Weighting for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training machine learning interatomic potentials often requires optimizing a loss function composed of three variables: potential energies, forces, and stress. The contribution of each variable to the total loss is typically weighted using fixed coefficients. Identifying these coefficients usually relies on iterative or heuristic methods, which may yield sub-optimal
  results. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive loss weighting algorithm that automatically adjusts the loss weights of these variables during the training of potentials, dynamically adapting to the characteristics of the training dataset. The comparative analysis of models trained with fixed and adaptive loss weights demonstrates that the adaptive method not only achieves a more balanced predictions across the three variables but also improves overall prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Extreme Terahertz Magnon Multiplication Induced by Resonant Magnetic Pulse Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions of spin-waves and their quanta, magnons, have emerged as prominent candidates for interference-based technology, ranging from quantum transduction to antiferromagnetic spintronics. Yet magnon multiplication in the terahertz (THz) spectral region represents a major challenge. Intense, resonant magnetic fields from THz pulse-pairs with controllable phases and amplitudes enable high order THz magnon multiplication, distinct from non-resonant nonlinearities such as the high harmonic generation by below-band gap electric fields. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally high-order THz nonlinear magnonics. It manifests as 7$^\text{th}$-order spin-wave-mixing and 6$^\text{th}$ harmonic magnon generation in an antiferromagnetic orthoferrite. We use THz multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to achieve high-sensitivity detection of nonlinear magnon interactions up to six-magnon quanta in strongly-driven many-magnon correlated states. The high-order magnon multiplication, supported by classical and quantum spin simulations, elucidates the significance of four-fold magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya symmetry breaking. Moreover, our results shed light on the potential quantum fluctuation properties inherent in nonlinear magnons.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>THz probing of non-trivial topological states in Co2MnGe Heusler alloy thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co2MnGe (CMG) has been demonstrated recently as a half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy which possesses a topologically non-trivial band structure. This behavior is unique to such systems and hence warrants extensive experimental exploration for potential spintronic and chirality sensitive optoelectonic applications. Here, we demonstrate that an epitaxial thin film of CMG acts as a source of THz radiation upon photoexcitation by optical femtosecond laser pulses. Detailed experiments have revealed that a large contribution to THz emission occurs due to nonmagnetic or spin-independent origin, however, significant contribution in the THz generation is evidenced through excitation light helicity dependent circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) confirming the presence of topologically non-trivial carriers. Furthermore, we show that not only the topological contribution is easily suppressed but also the overall THz generation efficiency is also affected adversely for the epitaxial films grown at high substrate temperatures.</description>

      <title>$J_{eff}$ states in a quasi one dimensional antiferromagnetic spin chain hexagonal Iridates Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$ (M=Mg, Zn, Cd): an $ab-initio$ comparative perspective</title>

Abstract: We employ first-principles density-functional theory, to perform a comparative investigation of the effect of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the electronic and magnetic properties of three experimentally synthesized and characterized hexagonal perovskites Sr$_3$MIrO$_6$(M=Mg, Zn, Cd). The electronic structure calculations show that in all the compounds, Ir is the only magnetically active site in +4[5$d^5$] configuration, whereas M$^{+2}$ (M=Cd, Zn, Mg), remains in nonmagnetic states with Cd/Zn and Mg featuring $d^{10}$ and $d^{0}$ electronic configurations, respectively. The insulating gap could be opened by switching on the correlation parameter $U$ for Sr$_3$CdrO$_6$ and Sr$_3$ZnIrO$_6$ which qualifies it to be a correlated Mott insulator. However, in the case of Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ both $U$ and antiferromagnetic ordering is not enough and the gap could only be opened by including the SOC which classifies it to fall under the category of a typical SOC Mott insulator. The $j_{eff}$ states are visualized from the orbital projected band structure. The magnetism is studied from the point of view of exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the presence of the SOC. We also present the comparative analysis of the renormalized impact of SOC on the three compounds, which shows that all the three compounds fall under the $intermediate$ coupling regime, where Sr$_3$MgIrO$_6$ is comparatively closer to the atomic $j_{eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ picture from the others.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Hydroflux-Controlled Growth of Magnetic K-Cu-Te-O(H) Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovative synthetic approaches can yield new phases containing novel structural and magnetic motifs. In this work, we show the synthesis and magnetic characterization of three new and one previously reported layered phase in the K-Cu-Te-O(H) phase space using a tunable hydroflux technique. The hydroflux, with a roughly equal molar ratio of water and alkali hydroxide, is a highly oxidizing, low melting solvent which can be used to isolate metastable phases unattainable through traditional solid state or flux techniques. The newly synthesized phases, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$, K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O, contain Cu$^{2+}$ within CuO$_{4}$ square planar plaquettes and TeO$_{6}$ octahedra ordering to form structural honeycomb layers isolated by interlayer K$^{+}$ ions and H$_{2}$O molecules. We find the synthesized structures display varying tilt sequences of the CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes, leading to distinct Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic motifs on the structural honeycomb lattice and a range of effective magnetic dimensionalities. We find that K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O does not order and displays alternating chain Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior, while K$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ and K$_{6}$Cu$_{9}$Te$_{4}$O$_{24}$ $\cdot$ 2 H$_{2}$O order antiferromagnetically (T$_{N}$ = 100 K and T$_{N}$ = 6.5 K respectively). The previously known phase, K$_{2}$CuTeO$_{4}$(OH)$_{2}$ $\cdot$ H$_{2}$O, we find contains structurally and magnetically one-dimensional CuO$_{4}$ plaquettes leading to uniform chain Heisenberg AFM behavior and shows no magnetic order down to T = 0.4 K. We discuss and highlight the usefulness of the hydroflux technique in novel syntheses and the interesting magnetic motifs that arise in these particular phases.</description>

      <title>Highly confined incident-angle-robust surface phonon polariton bound states in the continuum metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezing light into subwavelength dimensions is vital for on-chip integration of photonic technologies. One approach to overcome the diffraction limit is coupling light to material excitations, leading to polariton states. Here, we showcase how low-loss mid-infrared surface phonon polaritons enable metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) with deeply subwavelength unit cells. Utilizing 100 nm thick free-standing silicon carbide membranes, we achieve highly confined qBIC states with a unit cell volume ~ 10^4 times smaller than the diffraction limit. This results in remarkable robustness of the platform against the incident angle that is unique among qBIC systems. We also demonstrate vibrational strong coupling with a thin layer of spin-coated molecules, leveraging the small mode volume. This work introduces phononic qBICs as a novel ultra-confined nanophotonic platform, paving a way for the miniaturization of mid-infrared devices for molecular sensing and thermal radiation engineering.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopy of Carboxylate-Passivated Semiconducting Nanocrystals: Simulation and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands which exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. Experimentally, binding geometries of such ligands are typically investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain a good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of `tilted-bridge'-type geometries and does not indicate a coexistence of `bridging' and `chelating' binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.</description>

Abstract: We present an atomically precise technique to create sulfur vacancies and control their atomic configurations in single-layer MoS$_{2}$. It involves adsorbed Fe atoms and the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, which enables single sulfur removal from the top sulfur layer at the initial position of Fe. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we show that the STM tip can also induce two Jahn-Teller distorted states with reduced orbital symmetry in the sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory calculations rationalize our experimental results. Additionally, we provide evidence for molecule-like hybrid orbitals in artificially created sulfur vacancy dimers, which illustrates the potential of our technique for the development of extended defect lattices and tailored electronic band structures.</description>

      <title>A Prompt-Engineered Large Language Model, Deep Learning Workflow for Materials Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide array of domains. Owing to the very large number of parameters and training data in LLMs, these models inherently encompass an expansive and comprehensive materials knowledge database, far exceeding the capabilities of individual researcher. Nonetheless, devising methods to harness the knowledge embedded within LLMs for the design and discovery of novel materials remains a formidable challenge. We introduce a general approach for addressing materials classification problems, which incorporates LLMs, prompt engineering, and deep learning. Utilizing a dataset of metallic glasses as a case study, our methodology achieved an improvement of up to 463% in prediction accuracy compared to conventional classification models. These findings underscore the potential of leveraging textual knowledge generated by LLMs for materials especially in the common situation where datasets are sparse, thereby promoting innovation in materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Shotgun crystal structure prediction using machine-learned formation energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stable or metastable crystal structures of assembled atoms can be predicted by finding the global or local minima of the energy surface defined on the space of the atomic configurations. Generally, this requires repeated first-principles energy calculations that are impractical for large systems, such as those containing more than 30 atoms in the unit cell. Here, we have made significant progress in solving the crystal structure prediction problem with a simple but powerful machine-learning workflow; using a machine-learning surrogate for first-principles energy calculations, we performed non-iterative, single-shot screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures. The present method relies on two key technical components: transfer learning, which enables a highly accurate energy prediction of pre-relaxed crystalline states given only a small set of training samples from first-principles calculations, and generative models to create promising and diverse crystal structures for screening. Here, first-principles calculations were performed only to generate the training samples, and for the optimization of a dozen or fewer finally narrowed-down crystal structures. Our shotgun method proved to be computationally less demanding compared to conventional methods, which heavily rely on iterations of first-principles calculations, and achieved an exceptional prediction accuracy, reaching 92.2% in a benchmark task involving the prediction of 90 different crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Unraveling a cavity induced molecular polarization mechanism from collective vibrational strong coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarizations in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation to a cavity-Hartree equation for the electronic structure. Consequently, each individual molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling to the dipoles of all other molecules, which amount to non-negligible values in the thermodynamic limit (large ensembles). Thus collective vibrational strong coupling can alter individual molecules strongly for localized "hotspots" within the ensemble. Moreover, the discovered cavity-induced polarization pattern possesses a zero net polarization, which resembles a continuous form of a spin glass (or better polarization glass). Our findings suggest that the thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, requires a self-consistent treatment of dressed electronic structure, which can give rise to numerous, so far overlooked, physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Vibrational Stability of Copper-substituted Lead Apatite (LK-99)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two recent preprints in the physics archive (arXiv) have called attention as they claim experimental evidence that a Cu-substituted apatite material (dubbed LK-99) exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and pressure. If this proves to be true, LK-99 will be a ``holy grail" of superconductors. In this work, we used Density Functional Theory (DFT+U) calculations to elucidate some key features of the electronic structure of LK-99. We find two different phases of this material: (i) a hexagonal lattice featuring metallic half-filled and spin-split bands, a nesting of the Fermi surface, a remarkably large electron-phonon coupling, but this lattice is vibrationally unstable. (ii) a triclinic lattice, with the Cu and surrounding O distorted. This lattice is vibrationally stable and its bands correspond to an insulator. In a crystal, the Cu atoms should oscillate between equivalent triclinic positions, with an average close to the hexagonal positions. We discuss the electronic structure expected from these fluctuations and if it is compatible with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a layered cobalt oxychalcogenide Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O with a triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in bulk materials under ambient pressure is extremely rare among the 3d transition metal compounds outside the layered cuprates and iron-based family. It is predominantly linked to highly anisotropic electronic properties and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surfaces. To date, the only known example of a Co-based exotic superconductor is the hydrated layered cobaltate, Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}\cdot$ yH$_{2}$O, and its superconductivity is realized in the vicinity of a spin-1/2 Mott state. However, the nature of the superconductivity in these materials is still a subject of intense debate, and therefore, finding a new class of superconductors will help unravel the mysteries of their unconventional superconductivity. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity at $\sim$ 6.3 K in our newly synthesized layered compound Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O, in which the edge-shared CoSe$_{6}$ octahedra form [CoSe$_{2}$] layers with a perfect triangular lattice of Co ions. It is the first 3d transition metal oxychalcogenide superconductor with distinct structural and chemical characteristics. Despite its relatively low $T_{c}$, this material exhibits very high superconducting upper critical fields, $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, which far exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 3 - 4. First-principles calculations show that Na$_{2}$CoSe$_{2}$O is a rare example of a negative charge transfer superconductor. This cobalt oxychalcogenide with a geometrical frustration among Co spins shows great potential as a highly appealing candidate for the realization of unconventional and/or high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity beyond the well-established Cu- and Fe-based superconductor families and opens a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Automated atomistic simulations of dissociated dislocations with ab initio accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In (M Hodapp and A Shapeev 2020 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 1 045005), we have proposed an algorithm that fully automatically trains machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) during large-scale simulations, and successfully applied it to simulate screw dislocation motion in body-centered cubic tungsten. The algorithm identifies local subregions of the large-scale simulation region where the potential extrapolates, and then constructs periodic configurations of 100--200 atoms out of these non-periodic subregions that can be efficiently computed with plane-wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes.
  In this work, we extend this algorithm to dissociated dislocations with arbitrary character angles and apply it to partial dislocations in face-centered cubic aluminum. Given the excellent agreement with available DFT reference results, we argue that our algorithm has the potential to become a universal way of simulating dissociated dislocations in face-centered cubic and possibly also other materials, such as hexagonal closed-packed magnesium, and their alloys. Moreover, it can be used to construct reliable training sets for MLIPs to be used in large-scale simulations of curved dislocations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>
