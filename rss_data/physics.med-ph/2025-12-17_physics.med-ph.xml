      <title>Super-Resolution Posterior Ocular Microvascular Imaging Using 3-D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy With a 32X32 Matrix Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to enable in-vivo three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) of posterior ocular microvasculature using a 256-channel system and a 1024-element matrix array, and to overcome limitations of restricted transmit angles, sound speed mismatch caused by the crystalline lens and surrounding tissues, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of microbubble signals. To address phase distortions from the crystalline lens, which has a higher speed of sound (SOS) than surrounding tissues, a region-dependent SOS beamforming approach was implemented to improve microbubble resolution. A 4-D non-local means filter was subsequently applied to suppress background noise and enhance microbubble contrast. The proposed method improved localization accuracy and image quality, achieving a spatial resolution of 63 um, while Fourier shell correlation (1/2-bit threshold) confirmed a global resolution of approximately 59 um. Higher mean normalized cross-correlation coefficients between the microbubbles and the system point-spread function, obtained with the proposed method (approximately 0.67), compared with those without the proposed method (approximately 0.60), indicate enhanced microbubble signal quality. Furthermore, the 3-D bi-directional vessel density and flow-velocity maps were reconstructed, capturing detailed choroidal vascular and hemodynamic patterns. These results demonstrate that region-dependent SOS beamforming combined with spatiotemporal denoising enables high-resolution posterior ocular ULM and provides a practical pathway toward quantitative 3-D assessment of retinal and choroidal microvasculature for potential clinical use.</description>

      <title>Charge collection efficiency of thimble ionization chambers exposed to ultra-high dose per pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Commercially available ionization chambers (ICs) exposed to ultra-high dose per pulse (DPP) exhibit deviations from a linear dose response due to volume recombination. In the last years, phenomenological and simulation models have been developed to describe the charge collection efficiency (CCE) focused on parallel-plate ICs.
  Methods: The response of two PinPoint3D T31022 (PP3D) and two PinPoint T31023 (PP) ICs was investigated experimentally at the national metrology institute of Germany (PTB). The ICs were irradiated using the ultra-high-DPP reference electron beam with an energy of 20 MeV and DPPs between 0.1 Gy up to 9.3 Gy. The bias voltage supplied to the ICs was varied between +/- 200 V up to +/- 500 V. Additionally, the time-resolved signal of the ICs was recorded using an oscilloscope. To simulate the response of the chambers, a novel finite element code capable of simulating 1D and 2D geometries was developed. Three different geometries were considered to describe the investigated ICs: a cylindrical 1D geometry, a simplified 2D geometry and a complete 2D geometry including the conductive guard ring of the ICs.
  Conclusions: Thimble ICs exposed to ultra-high-DPP exhibit a large polarity effect due to the different distribution and recombination of the charge carriers whether the free electrons drift toward the central or outer electrode. Although the two thimble ICs studied have a similar sensitive volume, the PP shows a greater CCE due to its smaller external radius. A numerical model based on the finite element method is able to satisfactory reproduce the actual CCE for these two chambers. For the PP3D, the inclusion of the guard ring in the simulation geometry is mandatory to obtain accurate results. At large DPPs, thimble ICs should be used with caution due to their large polarity effect.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Unbalance Effect Induced by a Journal Bearing in Rigid and Flexible Rotors: Experimental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work presents the experimental analyses of a rigid (short) and a flexible (long) rotor subject to thermal unbalance effects. The rotors are supported by a ball bearing and by a cylindrical journal bearing. The differential heating generated in the journal bearing is responsible for the thermal unbalance. The results obtained with the short rotor at 7 krpm showed an increase in the synchronous amplitudes but slight phase changes before stabilization. The pronounced hysteresis of the synchronous amplitudes obtained during coast-down proved that the amplitude increase is due to the thermal unbalance. The results obtained for the long rotor at 6.6 krpm showed the same stabilized response when start-up was performed in 180___s. However, an instability leading to journal bearing contact was triggered when the start-up time was decreased to 80___s. The presented experimental results are the synchronous amplitudes and phases, the mean temperatures, and the maximum temperature differences of the journal and of the bearing and the phase lags between the high spot and the hot spot.</description>
