      <title>Plasmon Resonance Model: Investigation of Analysis of Fake News Diffusion Model with Third Mover Intervention Using Soliton Solution in Non-Complete Information Game under Repeated Dilemma Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research note, we propose a new approach to model the fake news diffusion process within the framework of incomplete information games. In particular, we use nonlinear partial differential equations to represent the phenomenon of plasmon resonance, in which the diffusion of fake news is rapidly amplified within a particular social group or communication network, and analyze its dynamics through a soliton solution approach. In addition, we consider how first mover, second mover, and third mover strategies interact within this nonlinear system and contribute to the amplification or suppression of fake news diffusion. The model aims to understand the mechanisms of fake news proliferation and provide insights into how to prevent or combat it. By combining concepts from the social sciences and the physical sciences, this study attempts to develop a new theoretical framework for the contemporary problem of fake news.</description>

      <title>Introducing First-Principles Calculations: New Approach to Group Dynamics and Bridging Social Phenomena in TeNP-Chain Based Social Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note considers an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that bridges the gap between the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics applied to the study of materials such as tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) and graphene and the complex dynamics of social systems. The basis for this approach lies in the metaphorical parallels drawn between the structural features of TeNPs and graphene and the behavioral patterns of social groups in the face of misinformation. TeNPs exhibit unique properties such as the strengthening of covalent bonds within telluric chains and the disruption of secondary structure leading to the separation of these chains. This is analogous to increased cohesion within social groups and disruption of information flow between different subgroups, respectively. . Similarly, the outstanding properties of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, strength, and flexibility, provide additional aspects for understanding the resilience and adaptability of social structures in response to external stimuli such as fake news. This research note proposes a novel metaphorical framework for analyzing the spread of fake news within social groups, analogous to the structural features of telluric nanoparticles (TeNPs). We investigate how the strengthening of covalent bonds within TeNPs reflects the strengthening of social cohesion in groups that share common beliefs and values.</description>

      <title>Quantum in the media: A content analysis of frames in Dutch newspapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technology is expected to have an impact on society. Scientists warn against the use of certain frames because they may create barriers to effective science communication. We studied 385 Dutch newspaper articles for the use of these frames. Newspapers commonly explained quantum concepts when mentioning quantum technology. They also regularly framed quantum technology as beneficial and enigmatic, often in prominent positions of the articles. The economic development/competitiveness frame, the social progress frame and the risk frame were less common. Although these frames are only potential barriers, we encourage journalists to weigh them when communicating about quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Decades matter: Agricultural diversification increases financial profitability, biodiversity, and ecosystem services over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable agriculture in the 21st century requires the production of sufficient food while reducing the environmental impact and safeguarding human livelihoods. Many studies have confirmed agricultural diversification practices such as intercropping, organic farming and soil inoculations as a suitable pathway to achieve these goals, but long-term viability of socioeconomic and ecological benefits is uncertain. Here, we quantified the long-term effects of agricultural diversification practices on socioeconomic and ecological benefits based on 50 years of data from 184 meta-analyses and 4,260 effect sizes. We showed that, with neutral crop yield over time, financial profitability, most variables related to biological communities, all aspects of soil quality, and carbon sequestration benefits increased by up to 2823% over 20 years of practice. Non-crop diversification practices and the use of organic amendments increased benefits by up to 2000% after 50 years. A trade-off analysis between yield and other services showed win-win outcomes during the first 25 years. Our synthesis provides the urgently needed evidence for farmers and other decision-makers that diversification increases long-term profitability, biodiversity, and climate mitigation benefits, and therefore, allows upscaling diversification for climate change mitigation and global food system transformation.</description>

      <title>Biophysics in Africa: challenges, priorities, and hopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report is a serious call to scientists, innovators, investors, and policymakers to invest in the development of biophysics in Africa. The complex problems of our day demand multidisciplinary approaches, and biophysics offers training in much-needed multi- and cross-disciplinary thinking. Biophysics is a research field at the forefront of modern science because it provides a powerful scientific platform that addresses many of the critical challenges humanity faces today and in the future. It is a vital source of innovation for any country interested in developing a high-tech economy. However, there is woefully little biophysics educational and research activity in Africa, representing a critical gap that must be addressed with urgency. This report suggests key research areas that African biophysicists should focus on, identifies major challenges to growing biophysics in Africa, and underscores the high-priority needs that must be addressed.</description>

      <title>Topological Determinants of Perturbation Spreading in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreading phenomena essentially underlie the dynamics of various natural and technological networked systems, yet how spatiotemporal propagation patterns emerge from such networks remains largely unknown. Here we propose a novel approach that reveals universal features determining the spreading dynamics in diffusively coupled networks and disentangles them from factors that are system specific. In particular, we first analytically identify a purely topological factor encoding the interaction structure and strength, and second, numerically estimate a master function characterizing the universal scaling of the perturbation arrival times across topologically different networks. The proposed approach thereby provides intuitive insights into complex propagation patterns as well as accurate predictions for the perturbation arrival times. The approach readily generalizes to a wide range of networked systems with diffusive couplings and may contribute to assess the risks of transient influences of ubiquitous perturbations in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the centrality of the Huanan market among early COVID-19 cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centrality of Wuhan's Huanan market in maps of December 2019 COVID-19 case residential locations, established by Worobey et al. (2022a), has recently been challenged by Stoyan and Chiu (2024, SC2024). SC2024 proposed a statistical test based on the premise that the measure of central tendency (hereafter, "centre") of a sample of case locations must coincide with the exact point from which local transmission began. Here we show that this premise is erroneous. SC2024 put forward two alternative centres (centroid and mode) to the centre-point which was used by Worobey et al. for some analyses, and proposed a bootstrapping method, based on their premise, to test whether a particular location is consistent with it being the point source of transmission. We show that SC2024's concerns about the use of centre-points are inconsequential, and that use of centroids for these data is inadvisable. The mode is an appropriate, even optimal, choice as centre; however, contrary to SC2024's results, we demonstrate that with proper implementation of their methods, the mode falls at the entrance of a parking lot at the market itself, and the 95% confidence region around the mode includes the market. Thus, the market cannot be rejected as central even by SC2024's overly stringent statistical test. Our results directly contradict SC2024's and -- together with myriad additional lines of evidence overlooked by SC2024, including crucial epidemiological information -- point to the Huanan market as the early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of WallStreetBets: social roles and opinion leaders across the GameStop saga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays human interactions largely take place on social networks, with online users' behavior often falling into a few general typologies or "social roles". Among these, opinion leaders are of crucial importance as they have the ability to spread an idea or opinion on a large scale across the network, with possible tangible consequences in the real world. In this work we extract and characterize the different social roles of users within the Reddit WallStreetBets community, around the time of the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 -- when a handful of committed users led the whole community to engage in a large and risky financial operation. We identify the profiles of both average users and of relevant outliers, including opinion leaders, using an iterative, semi-supervised classification algorithm, which allows us to discern the characteristics needed to play a particular social role. The key features of opinion leaders are large risky investments and constant updates on a single stock, which allowed them to attract a large following and, in the case of GameStop, ignite the interest of the community. Finally, we observe a substantial change in the behavior and attitude of users after the short squeeze event: no new opinion leaders are found and the community becomes less focused on investments. Overall, this work sheds light on the users' roles and dynamics that led to the GameStop short squeeze, while also suggesting why WallStreetBets no longer wielded such large influence on financial markets, in the aftermath of this event.</description>

      <title>Six Hypotheses for Accelerating the Lunar Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on technical work and development conducted under the LunA-10 study, I have identified six hypotheses where, if revolutionary improvements in technology can be made, I assess that a direct acceleration to the fielding of a lunar economy is likely to occur. In this short paper, I explain these six hypotheses, and recommend that these topics be focused on for technical development in the near-future by government and commercial stakeholders. These areas are: (1) Centralized thermal rejection and generation as a service, (2) Widespread orbital lunar prospecting and surveying, (3) Creating large silicon wafers for microsystems on the Moon, (4) Biomanufacturing to accelerate lunar construction, (5) New concepts to increase refinement rates in low gravity, (6) New concepts for Lunar Position, Navigation and Timing.</description>

      <title>Fusion energy commercialization requires solving social and environmental challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion energy, the process that uses the same reaction that powers the sun and the stars, offers the promise of virtually unlimited, carbon-free energy and is approaching reality. Recently, there's been a dramatic global increase in the investment and research focused on addressing the hurdles to commercialize fusion energy. While a majority of the effort has been focused on gaps in technology, little work has been done to address the societal and environmental impacts of this technology. Three community- and environmentally-focused research priorities are identified for commercializing fusion energy: 1) understanding the environmental impacts of fusion energy across the technology lifecycle, 2) developing risk and safety assessment methodologies for fusion power plant technologies, and 3) creating a community-based socially engaged approach for fusion technology design and development. This approach will benefit private companies who wish to deploy future fusion power plants as concerns about the technology will be addressed early in the design process, thus minimizing delays in deployment that may result in increased costs for developers. Community engagement around fusion technology development must be evidence-based in order to build trust between communities and technology developers. Such an approach is grounded in informed consent is vital for the sustainable development and use of fusion technologies.</description>

      <title>On the temporal resolution limits of numerical simulations in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we formalize, using the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, a fundamental temporal resolution limit for numerical experiments in complex systems. A consequence of this limit is aliasing, the introduction of spurious frequencies due to sampling. By imposing these limits on the uncertainty principle in harmonic analysis, we show that by increasing the sampling interval $\Delta t$, we can also artificially stretch the temporal behavior of our numerical experiment. Importantly, in limiting cases, we could even observe a new artificially created absorbing state. Our findings are validated in deterministic and stochastic simulations. In deterministic systems, we analyzed the Kuramoto model in which aliasing could be observed. In stochastic simulations, we formalized and compared different simulation approaches and showed their temporal limits. Gillespie-like simulations fully capture the continuous-time Markov chain processes, being lossless. Asynchronous cellular automata methods capture the same transitions as the continuous-time process but lose the temporal information about the process. Finally, synchronous cellular automata simulations solve a sampled chain. By comparing these methods, we show that if $\Delta t$ is not small enough, the cellular automata approach fails to capture the original continuous-time Markov chain since the sampling is already built into the simulation method. Our results point to a fundamental limitation that cannot be overcome by traditional methods of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic of frustrated Kuramoto oscillators with modular connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization and collective movement are phenomena of a highly interdisciplinary nature, with examples ranging from neuronal activation to walking pedestrians. As of today, the Kuramoto model stands as the quintessential framework for investigating synchronization phenomena, displaying a second order phase transition from disordered motion to synchronization as the coupling between oscillators increases. The model was recently extended to higher dimensions allowing for the coupling parameter to be promoted to a matrix, leading to generalized frustration and new synchronized states. This model was previously investigated in the case of all-to-all and homogeneous interactions. Here, we extend the analysis to modular graphs, which mimic the community structure presented in many real systems. We investigated, both numerically and analytically, the matrix coupled Kuramoto model with oscillators divided into two groups with distinct coupling parameters to understand in which conditions they synchronize independently or globally. We discovered a very rich and complex dynamic, including an extended region in the parameter space in which the interactions between modules were destructive, leading to a global disordered motion even tough the uncoupled dynamic presented higher levels of synchronization. Additional simulations considering synthetic modular networks were performed to assess the robustness of our findings.</description>

      <title>Partner selection and evolution of out-group avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preferential treatment of in-group members is widely observed. This study examines this phenomenon in the domain of cooperation in social dilemmas using evolutionary agent-based models that consider the role of partner selection. The model considers a repeated prisoner's dilemma game, in which agents belong to one of two groups that are distinguished by the continuation probability of pair interactions. On the basis of the behavior in the last round and the group affiliation of the partner, each individual selects to cooperate, defect, or stop interactions and search for a different partner. The results of simulation demonstrated that agents adopt cooperative strategies, including tit-for-tat and out-for-tat, toward in-group members. By contrast, agents stop interactions immediately after pair formation without observing their partner's behavior when they are paired with an out-group individual. Higher continuation probability with in-group partners hinders interaction with out-group individuals. Our results imply the importance of avoidance in intergroup interactions in social dilemmas and might explain in-group favoritism without enmity toward out-groups.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Response Patterns of Network Dynamics -- an Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked dynamical systems, i.e., systems of dynamical units coupled via nontrivial interaction topologies, constitute models of broad classes of complex systems, ranging from gene regulatory and metabolic circuits in our cells to pandemics spreading across continents. Most of such systems are driven by irregular and distributed fluctuating input signals from the environment. Yet how networked dynamical systems collectively respond to such fluctuations depends on the location and type of driving signal, the interaction topology and several other factors and remains largely unknown to date. As a key example, modern electric power grids are undergoing a rapid and systematic transformation towards more sustainable systems, signified by high penetrations of renewable energy sources. These in turn introduce significant fluctuations in power input and thereby pose immediate challenges to the stable operation of power grid systems. How power grid systems dynamically respond to fluctuating power feed-in as well as other temporal changes is critical for ensuring a reliable operation of power grids yet not well understood. In this work, we systematically introduce a linear response theory for fluctuation-driven networked dynamical systems. The derivations presented not only provide approximate analytical descriptions of the dynamical responses of networks, but more importantly, allows to extract key qualitative features about spatio-temporally distributed response patterns. Specifically, we provide a general formulation of a linear response theory for perturbed networked dynamical systems, explicate how dynamic network response patterns arise from the solution of the linearized response dynamics, and emphasize the role of linear response theory in predicting and comprehending power grid responses on different temporal and spatial scales and to various types of disturbances.</description>

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these influential phases can enhance the effectiveness of support systems and funding allocation, fostering groundbreaking discoveries worthy of accolades. Historically, analyses have suggested that hot streaks occur randomly over time. However, our research, through meticulous examination, reveals that these phases are not flatly distributed but are more frequent at the early and late stages of scientists' careers. Notably, both early and late hot streaks are marked by dense tie collaborations, with the former typically involving close partnerships with particular authors and the latter being characterized by involvement in large-scale projects compared with single-top or ordinary papers. This pattern indicates that mid-career researchers lack both intimate relations and resources to keep big projects, leading to``mid-career pitfal'' of consecutive success. This insight holds profound implications for the development of policies and initiatives aimed at bolstering innovative research and discovery.</description>

      <title>Bernardo Dessau, fisico, scienziato, maestro, da Bologna a Perugia tra i marosi del secolo breve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seventy-five years ago, Bernardo Dessau passed away. He had been the sole professor of Physics at the University of Perugia for thirty years. With this brief contribution we intend to repay a debt of gratitude, first of all because his scientific merits were probably underestimated, having spent the first fifteen years of his career under the shadow of the great Augusto Righi in Bologna, where he also witnessed meetings with the young Marconi. He was then relegated to the Faculty of Medicine of Perugia, without a real laboratory, disregarded by the national scientific community and unable to move to better equipped locations. Nevertheless, he proved to be a gifted teacher and popularizer of science. He published a comprehensive three-volume physics textbook that was widely used in Italy and abroad. Despite becoming an Italian citizen in 1894, Dessau's German origins led to his suspension from service during World War I. Furthermore, his Jewish identity made him a target of Nazi-fascist antisemitism. He was dismissed from both the University of Perugia and from the Italian Society of Physics, of which he had been a member since its beginning, fortunately escaping deportation.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Recommendation Systems in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A closed-loop control model to analyze the impact of recommendation systems on opinion dynamics within social networks is introduced. The core contribution is the development and formalization of model-free and model-based approaches to recommendation system design, integrating the dynamics of social interactions within networks via an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. Comparative analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies in maximizing user engagement and their potential for influencing opinion formation processes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polarization Under Normative Institutions and Opinion Expression Stewarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although there is mounting empirical evidence for the increase in affective polarization, few mechanistic models can explain its emergence at the population level. The question of how such a phenomenon can emerge from divergent opinions of a population on an ideological issue is still an open issue. In this paper, we establish that human normativity, that is, individual expression of normative opinions based on beliefs about the population, can lead to population-level polarization when ideological institutions distort beliefs in accordance with their objective of moving expressed opinion to one extreme. Using a game-theoretic model, we establish that individuals with more extreme opinions will have more extreme rhetoric and higher misperceptions about their outgroup members. Our model also shows that when social recommendation systems mediate institutional signals, we can observe the formation of different institutional communities, each with its unique community structure and characteristics. Using the model, we identify practical strategies platforms can implement, such as reducing exposure to signals from ideological institutions and a tailored approach to content moderation, both of which can rectify the affective polarization problem within its purview.</description>

      <title>Waiting times for sea level variations in Port of Trieste: from scale-free to exponential-like distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report here a series of detailed statistical analyses on the sea level variations in the Port of Trieste using one of the largest existing catalogues that covers more than a century of measurements. We show that the distribution of waiting times, which are defined here akin to econophysics, namely the series of shortest time spans between a given sea level L and the next sea level of at least L + {\delta} in the catalogue, exhibits a distinct scale-free character for small values of {\delta}, while for larger values of {\delta} the distribution is very similar to the exponential distribution. The distribution of waiting times for small values of {\delta} is typical for complex systems exhibiting criticality and is reported abundantly in the literature, while the exponential-like distribution observed for large values of {\delta} has been observed in contexts as diverse as magnetic systems and light sleep duration.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cutting of Complex Networks Performed by Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several interesting approaches have been reported in the literature on complex networks, random walks, and hierarchy of graphs. While many of these works perform random walks on stable, fixed networks, in the present work we address the situation in which the connections traversed by each step of a uniformly random walks are progressively removed, yielding a successively less interconnected structure that may break into two components, therefore establishing a respective hierarchy. The sizes of each of these pairs of sliced networks, as well as the permanence of each connected component, are studied in the present work. Several interesting results are reported, including the tendency of geometrical networks sometimes to be broken into two components with comparable large sizes.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless Numbers Reveal Distinct Regimes in the Structure and Dynamics of Pedestrian Crowds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fluid mechanics, dimensionless numbers like the Reynolds number help classify flows. We argue that such a classification is also relevant for crowd flows by putting forward the dimensionless Intrusion and Avoidance numbers.Using an extensive dataset, we show that these delineate regimes that are characterized by distinct structural signatures, best probed in terms of distances at low Avoidance number and times-to-collision at low Intrusion number.These findings prompt a perturbative expansion of the agent-based dynamics; the generic models thus obtained perform well in (and only in) the regime in which they were derived.</description>

      <title>Motifs in earthquake networks: Romania, Italy, United States of America, and Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of seismic activity in Romania, Italy, and Japan, as well as the California seismic zone in the United States of America, based on the statistical analysis of the underlying earthquake networks used to model the aforementioned zones. Our results on network connectivity and simple network motifs allow for a complex description of seismic zones, while at the same time reinforcing the current understanding of seismicity as a critical phenomenon. The reported distributions on node connectivity, three-, and four-event motifs are consistent with power-law, i.e., scale-free, distributions over large intervals and are robust across earthquake networks obtained from different discretizations of the seismic zones of interest. In our analysis of the distributions of node connectivity and simple motifs, we distinguish between the global distribution and the powerlaw part of it with the help of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method and complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF). The main message is that the distributions reported for the aforementioned seismic zones have large power-law components, extending over some orders of magnitude, independent of discretization. All the results were obtained using publicly-available databases and open-source software, as well as a new toolbox available on GitHub, specifically designed to automatically analyze earthquake databases.</description>

      <title>The inherent goodness of well educated intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04846v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper will examine what makes a being intelligent, whether that be a biological being or an artificial silicon being on a computer. Special attention will be paid to the being having the ability to characterize and control a collective system of many identical conservative sub-systems conservatively interacting. The essence of intelligence will be found to be the golden rule -- "the collective acts as one" or "knowing the global consequences of local actions". The flow of the collective is a small set of twinkling textures, that are governed by a puppeteer who is pulling a small number of strings according to a geodesic motion of least action, determined by the symmetries. Controlling collective conservative systems is difficult and has historically been done by adding significant viscosity to the system to stabilize the desirable meta stable equilibriums of maximum performance, but it degrades or destroys them in the process. There is an alternative. Once the optimum twinkling textures of the meta stable equilibriums are identified, the collective system can be moved to the optimum twinkling textures, then quickly vibrated according to the textures so that the collective system remains at the meta stable equilibrium. Well educated intelligence knows the global consequences of its local actions so that it will not take short term actions that will lead to poor long term outcomes. In contrast, trained intelligence or trained stupidity will optimize its short term actions, leading to poor long term outcomes. Well educated intelligence is inherently good, but trained stupidity is inherently evil and should be feared. Particular attention is paid to the control and optimization of economic and social collectives. These new results are also applicable to physical collectives such as fields, fluids and plasmas.</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplification of epidemic spread by misinformed populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we propose an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. Our model allows us to simulate and estimate various scenarios to understand the impact of misinformation on epidemic spreading. Using this model, we estimate that misinformation could have led to 47 million additional COVID-19 infections in the U.S. in a worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Bridging or Breaking: Impact of Intergroup Interactions on Religious Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While exposure to diverse viewpoints may reduce polarization, it can also have a backfire effect and exacerbate polarization when the discussion is adversarial. Here, we examine the question whether intergroup interactions around important events affect polarization between majority and minority groups in social networks. We compile data on the religious identity of nearly 700,000 Indian Twitter users engaging in COVID-19-related discourse during 2020. We introduce a new measure for an individual's group conformity based on contextualized embeddings of tweet text, which helps us assess polarization between religious groups. We then use a meta-learning framework to examine heterogeneous treatment effects of intergroup interactions on an individual's group conformity in the light of communal, political, and socio-economic events. We find that for political and social events, intergroup interactions reduce polarization. This decline is weaker for individuals at the extreme who already exhibit high conformity to their group. In contrast, during communal events, intergroup interactions can increase group conformity. Finally, we decompose the differential effects across religious groups in terms of emotions and topics of discussion. The results show that the dynamics of religious polarization are sensitive to the context and have important implications for understanding the role of intergroup interactions.</description>
