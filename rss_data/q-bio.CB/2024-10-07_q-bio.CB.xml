      <title>Graphical models for inference: A model comparison approach for analyzing bacterial conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept of a model comparison approach for analyzing spatio-temporal observations of interacting populations. Our model variants are a collection of structurally similar Bayesian networks. Their distinct Noisy-Or conditional probability distributions describe interactions within the population, with each distribution corresponding to a specific mechanism of interaction. To determine which distributions most accurately represent the underlying mechanisms, we examine the accuracy of each Bayesian network with respect to observational data. We implement such a system for observations of bacterial populations engaged in conjugation, a type of horizontal gene transfer that allows microbes to share genetic material with nearby cells through physical contact. Evaluating cell-specific factors that affect conjugation is generally difficult because of the stochastic nature of the process. Our approach provides a new method for gaining insight into this process. We compare eight model variations for each of three experimental trials and rank them using two different metrics</description>

      <title>Support Graph Preconditioners for Off-Lattice Cell-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration, and liver lobules. These applications, which simulate thousands to millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods. At their core, these models necessitate the solution of a large friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse, symmetric, and positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this requires a good preconditioner for optimal performance. In this study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can be easily implemented in such agent-based models. Our approach centers on extending support graph preconditioners to block-structured matrices. We prove asymptotic bounds on the condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We then benchmark the conjugate gradient method with our support graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common preconditioning strategies.</description>
