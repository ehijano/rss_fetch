      <title>Orderbook Feature Learning and Asymmetric Generalization in Intraday Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is critical for market participants to inform trading decisions. Existing studies rely on specific domain features, such as Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and the last price. However, the rich information in the orderbook remains underexplored. Furthermore, these approaches are often developed within a single country and product type, making it unclear whether the approaches are generalizable. In this paper, we extract 384 features from the orderbook and identify a set of powerful features via feature selection. Based on selected features, we present a comprehensive benchmark using classical statistical models, tree-based ensembles, and deep learning models across two countries (Germany and Austria) and two product types (60-min and 15-min). We further perform a systematic generalization study across countries and product types, from which we reveal an asymmetric generalization phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The implied volatility surface (also) is path-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model for the forecasting of both the implied volatility surfaces and the underlying asset price. In the spirit of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023) who are interested in the dependence of volatility indices (e.g. the VIX) on the paths of the associated equity indices (e.g. the S\&amp;P 500), we first study how vanilla options implied volatility can be predicted using the past trajectory of the underlying asset price. Our empirical study reveals that a large part of the movements of the at-the-money-forward implied volatility for up to two years time-to-maturities can be explained using the past returns and their squares. Moreover, we show that this feedback effect gets weaker when the time-to-maturity increases. Building on this new stylized fact, we fit to historical data a parsimonious version of the SSVI parameterization (Gatheral and Jacquier, 2014) of the implied volatility surface relying on only four parameters and show that the two parameters ruling the at-the-money-forward implied volatility as a function of the time-to-maturity exhibit a path-dependent behavior with respect to the underlying asset price. Finally, we propose a model for the joint dynamics of the implied volatility surface and the underlying asset price. The latter is modelled using a variant of the path-dependent volatility model of Guyon and Lekeufack and the former is obtained by adding a feedback effect of the underlying asset price onto the two parameters ruling the at-the-money-forward implied volatility in the parsimonious SSVI parameterization and by specifying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the residuals of these two parameters and Jacobi processes for the two other parameters. Thanks to this model, we are able to simulate highly realistic paths of implied volatility surfaces that are free from static arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions to the Guyon-Lekeufack path-dependent volatility model with general kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of a continuous solution to a path-dependent volatility model introduced by Guyon and Lekeufack (2023) to model the price of an equity index and its spot volatility. The considered model for the trend and activity features can be written as a Stochastic Volterra Equation (SVE) with non-convolutional and non-bounded kernels as well as non-Lipschitz coefficients. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the SVE under integrability and regularity assumptions on the two kernels and under a condition on the second kernel weighting the past squared returns which ensures that the activity feature is bounded from below by a positive constant. Then, assuming in addition that the kernel weighting the past returns is of exponential type and that an inequality relating the logarithmic derivatives of the two kernels with respect to their second variables is satisfied, we show the positivity of the volatility process which is obtained as a non-linear function of the SVE's solution. We show numerically that the choice of an exponential kernel for the kernel weighting the past returns has little impact on the quality of model calibration compared to other choices and the inequality involving the logarithmic derivatives is satisfied by the calibrated kernels. These results extend those of Nutz and Valdevenito (2023).</description>

      <title>Computing Systemic Risk Measures with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</description>

      <title>An optimal transport approach for the multiple quantile hedging problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multiple quantile hedging problem, which is a class of partial hedging problems containing as special examples the quantile hedging problem (F{\"o}llmer \&amp; Leukert 1999) and the PnL matching problem (introduced in Bouchard \&amp; Vu 2012). In complete non-linear markets, we show that the problem can be reformulated as a kind of Monge optimal transport problem. Using this observation, we introduce a Kantorovitch version of the problem and prove that the value of both problems coincide. In the linear case, we thus obtain that the multiple quantile hedging problem can be seen as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem, for which we further introduce the dual problem. We then prove that there is no duality gap, allowing us to design a numerical method based on SGA algorithms to compute the multiple quantile hedging price.</description>
