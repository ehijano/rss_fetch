      <title>Random processes for long-term market simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For long term investments, model portfolios are defined at the level of indexes, a setup known as Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA). The possible outcomes at a scale of a few decades can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a probability density for the possible portfolio values at the investment horizon. Such studies are critical for long term wealth plannings, for example in the financial component of social insurances or in accumulated capital for retirement. The quality of the results depends on two inputs: the process used for the simulations and its parameters. The base model is a constant drift, a constant covariance and normal innovations, as pioneered by Bachelier. Beyond this model, this document presents in details a multivariate process that incorporate the most recent advances in the models for financial time series. This includes the negative correlations of the returns at a scale of a few years, the heteroskedasticity (i.e. the volatility' dynamics), and the fat tails and asymmetry for the distributions of returns. For the parameters, the quantitative outcomes depend critically on the estimate for the drift, because this is a non random contribution acting at each time step. Replacing the point forecast by a probabilistic forecast allows us to analyze the impact of the drift values, and then to incorporate this uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Unified GARCH-Recurrent Neural Network in Financial Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a unified volatility modeling framework that embeds GARCH dynamics directly within recurrent neural networks. We propose two interpretable hybrid architectures, GARCH-GRU and GARCH-LSTM, that integrate the GARCH(1,1) volatility update into the multiplicative gating structure of GRU and LSTM cells. This unified design preserves economically meaningful GARCH parameters while enabling the networks to learn nonlinear temporal dependencies in financial time series. Comprehensive out-of-sample evaluations across major U.S. equity indices show that both models consistently outperform classical GARCH specifications, pipeline-style hybrids, and neural baselines such as the Transformer across multiple metrics (MSE, MAE, SMAPE, and out-of-sample R\textsuperscript{2}). Within this family, the GARCH-GRU achieves the strongest accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, training nearly three times faster than GARCH-LSTM while maintaining comparable or superior forecasting accuracy under normal market conditions and delivering stable and economically plausible parameter estimates. The advantages persist during extreme market turbulence. In the COVID-19 stress period, both architectures retain superior forecasting accuracy and deliver well-calibrated 99 percent Value-at-Risk forecasts, achieving lower violation ratios and competitive Pinball losses relative to all benchmarks. Overall, the findings underscore the effectiveness of embedding GARCH dynamics within recurrent neural architectures, yielding models that are accurate, efficient, interpretable, and robust for real-world risk-aware volatility forecasting.</description>
