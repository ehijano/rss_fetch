      <title>Nanoconfinement Effects on Intermolecular Forces Observed via Dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although wettability is a macroscopic manifestation of molecular-level forces, such as van der Waals (vdW) forces, the impact of nanoconfinement on material properties in reduced film thickness remains unexplored in predicting film stability. In this work, we investigate how nanoconfinement influences intermolecular interactions using a model trilayer system composed of a thick polystyrene (PS) base, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) middle layer with tunable thickness (15-95 nm), and a 10 nm top PS film. We find that the dewetting behavior of the top PS layer is highly sensitive to middle PMMA thickness, deviating from classical vdW-based predictions that assume bulk material properties. By incorporating nanoconfinement-induced changes in PMMA refractive index into the calculation of the Hamaker constant, we present a modified theoretical framework that successfully captures the observed behavior. This study links dewetting behavior and material property change as a function of underlayer thickness, providing direct evidence that nanoconfinement in soft matter systems significantly influences long-range intermolecular interactions. We show that film stability can be tuned solely by adjusting underlying layer thickness, while preserving both chemistry and thickness of top functional film. This finding carries broad implications for thin-film technologies across scientific and engineering disciplines by enabling performance-targeted interface design.</description>

      <title>Only the Ambidextrous Can Flock: Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks, Time crystals, and the KPZ Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a "time crystal", in which the velocity rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive measurement of local stress inside soft materials with programmed shear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical stresses in soft materials across different length scales play a fundamental role in understanding the function of biological systems and in the use of artificial materials for engineering soft machines and biomedical devices. Yet it remains a great challenge to probe local mechanical stresses in situ in a non-invasive, non-destructive manner, in particular when the mechanical properties are unknown. To address this challenge, we propose an acoustoelastic imaging-based method to infer the local mechanical stresses in soft materials by measuring the speed of shear waves induced by custom-programmed acoustic radiation force. Using a medical ultrasound transducer to excite and track the shear waves remotely, we demonstrate the application of the method by imaging uniaxial stress and bending stress in an isotropic hydrogel, and the passive uniaxial stress in a skeletal muscle. These measurements were all done without the knowledge of the constitutive parameters of the materials. These examples indicate that our method will find broad applications, ranging from health monitoring of soft structures and machines, to the diagnosis of diseases that alter stresses in soft tissues.</description>

      <title>Understanding Flow Behaviors of Supercooled Liquids by Embodying Solid-Liquid Duality at Particle Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled liquids exhibit intricate flow behaviors, which progressively become nonlinear as flow rate increases. Conceptually, this complexity can be understood by the solid-liquid duality in Maxwell's understanding of materials' response to external load. Nevertheless, the microscopic foundation of this duality in supercooled liquids remains elusive, thereby impeding the modeling of flow behaviors from a microscopic viewpoint. The existence of dynamic heterogeneity adds to this difficulty. To tackle these problems, we propose the concept of local configurational relaxation time $\tau_\rm{LC}$, which is defined at the particle level. The spatial distribution of $\tau_\rm{LC}$ in flow is heterogeneous. Depending on the comparison between the local mobility measured by $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the external shear rate, the response of local regions is either solid-like or liquid-like. In this way, $\tau_\rm{LC}$ plays a role similar to the Maxwell time. By applying this microscopic solid-liquid duality to different conditions of shear flow, we describe the emergence of shear thinning in steady shear, and predict the major characteristics of the transient response to start-up shear. Furthermore, we reveal a clear structural foundation for $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the solid-liquid duality associated with it by introducing an order parameter extracted from local configuration. Thus, we establish a framework that connects microscopic structure, dynamics, local mechanical response, and flow behaviors for supercooled liquids. Finally, we rationalize our framework by leveraging the connection among structure, dynamics, and potential energy landscape (PEL). The PEL model illustrates how local structure, convection and thermal activation collectively determine $\tau_\rm{LC}$. Notably, it predicts two distinct response groups, which well correspond to the microscopic solid-liquid duality.</description>

      <title>Canceling the elastic Poynting effect with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poynting effect is a paragon of nonlinear soft matter mechanics. It is the tendency (found in all incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic solids) exhibited by a soft block to expand vertically when sheared horizontally. It can be observed whenever the length of the cuboid is at least four times its thickness. Here we show that the Poynting effect can be easily reversed and the cuboid can shrink vertically, simply by reducing this aspect ratio. In principle, this discovery means that for a given solid, say one used as a seismic wave absorber under a building, an optimal ratio exists where vertical displacements and vibrations can be completely eliminated. Here we first recall the classical theoretical treatment of the positive Poynting effect, and then show experimentally how it can be reversed. Using Finite Element simulations, we then investigate how the effect can be suppressed. We find that cubes always provide a reverse Poynting effect, irrespective of their material properties (in the third-order theory of weakly nonlinear elasticity).</description>

      <title>Mechanical Degradation of Unentangled Polymer Melts under Uniaxial Extensional Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex flow fields govern the deformation of polymers in various manufacturing processes. However, high flow rates may trigger reaction events (i.e., bond breaking or undesirable reaction of mechanophores) in raw polymeric materials, leading to the mechanical or functional debasement of manufactured structures. Additionally, it is difficult to fully characterize such molecular-level flow in the laboratory due to time- and length-scale limits. In this study, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to explore the rheological and mechanical degradation of unentangled polymer melts under uniaxial extensional flow (UEF), allowing for chain breaking. Our simulations demonstrate shear thickening-thinning-thickening stages with the increase of UEF extension rates, resulting from flow-induced changes of chain conformation. With further increasing UEF extension rates, a bond-breaking potential leads to another flow thinning stage. Interestingly, fracture kinetics is originally first-order owing to the need for highly stretched polymer chains before bond fracture. It is no longer first-order when bond fracture is instigated before chains are stretched. Our computational work provides insight into the optimal design of the manufacturing process for polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Complex rheology of condensin in entangled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural-Maintenance-of-Chromosome (SMC) complexes such as condensins are well-known to dictate the folding and entanglement of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. However, their role in modulating the rheology and viscoelasticity of entangled DNA is not fully understood. In this work, we discover that physiological concentrations of yeast condensin increase both the effective viscosity and elasticity of dense solutions of $\lambda$-DNA even in absence of ATP. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule imaging, we discover that yeast condensin can proficiently bind double-stranded DNA through its hinge domain, in addition to its heads. We further discover that presence of ATP fluidifies the entangled solution possibly by activating loop extrusion. Finally, we show that the observed rheology can be understood by modelling SMCs as transient crosslinkers in bottle-brush-like entangled polymers. Our findings help us to understand how SMCs affect the rheology and dynamics of the genome.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Orientational Defects Mediate Collective Transport of Confluent Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confluent tissues are a type of foam-like biological active matter. There is a recent interest in using active nematic liquid crystal framework to understand confluent cells, where topological (orientational) defects are believed to play a crucial role. However, how to reconcile the physical picture of lattice defects in Voronoi polygons with that of orientational defects in the nematic field$-$particularly in the context of cellular transport$-$remains elusive. Here, we employ the Active Vertex model to investigate the physics of lattice and orientational defects in the dynamics of confluent cells. We find a spatio-orientational correlation between lattice defects and $+1/2$ defects, unveiling a correspondence between the two physical perspectives. Next, we simulate the behavior of a dragged cell within a hexagonal-lattice tissue. Our results reveal that while the drag coefficient is anisotropic, the threshold drag force to mobilize the cell is isotropic, indicating the presence of a caging energy barrier. We further analyze the defect pattern in the wake of the dragged cell or cells. Remarkably, we discover that dragging two neighboring cells along the least-drag direction can substantially minimize the destruction of the lattice structure during cell transport. We find that this is due to the cooperative and periodic self-healing of the lattice defects. Taken together, our work sheds new light on the topological structure of confluent cells during their collective motion, advancing our physical understanding of cellular transport in processes such as wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, and other physiological events.</description>

      <title>Programmable wrinkling for functionally-graded auxetic circular membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic materials, display exotic properties such as expansion in all directions under uni-axial tension. For their unique properties, these materials find a broad range of applications in robotic, structural, aerospace, and biomedical engineering.
  In this work we study the wrinkling behavior of thin and soft auxetic membranes, subjected to edge tractions. We show that spatial inhomogeneities of the Young modulus and of the Poisson ratio can be suitably tailored to produce non-trivial wrinkling patterns, with wrinkled regions that can appear, broaden, merge, and eventually disappear again, as the magnitude of applied tractions is increased monotonically. To model wrinkling in a functionally graded membrane, we employ the mathematically elegant and physically transparent tension field theory, an approximated method that we implement in commercially available software.
  Beyond unveiling the challenging technological potential to achieve non-standard wrinkling on-demand in auxetic membranes, our study also confirms the potential of using tension field theory to study, analytically and numerically, instabilities in functionally graded materials.</description>

      <title>Defect states in compressible active polar fluids with turnover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological active matter like the cytoskeleton or tissues are characterized by their ability to transform chemical energy into mechanical stress. In addition, it often exhibits orientational order, which is essential for many cellular and morphogenetic processes. Experimental evidence suggests that defects in the orientational order field play an important role in organizing active stress. However, defects tend to annihilate unless the material is in a chaotic state or hydrodynamic interactions are suppressed. Using a hydrodynamic description of compressible active polar fluids, we show that turnover readily leads to a stabilization of defects. Depending on the turnover rate, topological defects arrange in a multitude of different phases, including lattices, active foams, and vortex glasses. Our work suggests that turnover plays a crucial role for organizing biological active matter.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal field theory for decision-making in multi-agent control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviors emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>
