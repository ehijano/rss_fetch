      <title>Continuous Domains for Function Spaces Using Spectral Compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous domain for function spaces over topological spaces which are not core-compact. Notable examples of such topological spaces include the real line with the upper limit topology, which is used in solution of initial value problems with temporal discretization, and various infinite dimensional Banach spaces which are ubiquitous in functional analysis and solution of partial differential equations. If a topological space $\mathbb{X}$ is not core-compact and $\mathbb{D}$ is a non-singleton bounded-complete domain, the function space $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ is not a continuous domain. To construct a continuous domain, we consider a spectral compactification $\mathbb{Y}$ of $\mathbb{X}$ and relate $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ with the continuous domain $[\mathbb{Y} \to \mathbb{D}]$ via a Galois connection. This allows us to perform computations in the native structure $[\mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{D}]$ while computable analysis is performed in the continuous domain $[\mathbb{Y} \to \mathbb{D}]$, with the left and right adjoints used for moving between the two function spaces.</description>

      <title>An SMT Theory for n-Indexed Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) theory of arrays is well-established and widely used, with variousdecision procedures and extensions developed for it. However, recent works suggest that developing tailoredreasoning for some theories, such as sequences and strings, is more efficient than reasoning over them throughaxiomatization over the theory of arrays. In this paper, we are interested in reasoning over n-indexed sequences asthey are found in some programming languages, such as Ada. We propose an SMT theory of n-indexed sequencesand explore different ways to represent and reason over n-indexed sequences using existing theories, as well astailored calculi for the theory.</description>

      <title>Formalization of physics index notation in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics community relies on index notation to effectively manipulate types of tensors. This paper introduces the first formally verified implementation of index notation in the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. By integrating index notation into Lean, we bridge the gap between traditional physics notation and formal verification tools, making it more accessible for physicists to write and prove results within Lean. We also open up a new avenue through which AI tools can be used to prove results related to tensors in physics. Behind the scenes our implementation leverages a novel application of category theory.</description>

      <title>Typed Non-determinism in Concurrent Calculi: The Eager Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing typed concurrent calculi with non-deterministic choice in which types leverage linearity for controlling resources, thereby ensuring strong correctness properties for processes. This problem is constrained by the delicate tension between non-determinism and linearity. Prior work developed a session-typed {\pi}-calculus with standard non-deterministic choice; well-typed processes enjoy type preservation and deadlock-freedom. Central to this typed calculus is a lazy semantics that gradually discards branches in choices. This lazy semantics, however, is complex: various technical elements are needed to describe the non-deterministic behavior of typed processes. This paper develops an entirely new approach, based on an eager semantics, which more directly represents choices and commitment. We present a {\pi}-calculus in which non-deterministic choices are governed by this eager semantics and session types. We establish its key correctness properties, including deadlock-freedom, and demonstrate its expressivity by correctly translating a typed resource {\lambda}-calculus.</description>

      <title>Feasibly Constructive Proof of Schwartz-Zippel Lemma and the Complexity of Finding Hitting Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma states that if a low-degree multivariate polynomial with coefficients in a field is not zero everywhere in the field, then it has few roots on every finite subcube of the field. This fundamental fact about multivariate polynomials has found many applications in algorithms, complexity theory, coding theory, and combinatorics. We give a new proof of the lemma that offers some advantages over the standard proof.
  First, the new proof is more constructive than previously known proofs. For every given side-length of the cube, the proof constructs a polynomial-time computable and polynomial-time invertible surjection onto the set of roots in the cube. The domain of the surjection is tight, thus showing that the set of roots on the cube can be compressed. Second, the new proof can be formalised in Buss' bounded arithmetic theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2$ for polynomial-time reasoning. One consequence of this is that the theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2 + \mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$ for approximate counting can prove that the problem of verifying polynomial identities (PIT) can be solved by polynomial-size circuits. The same theory can also prove the existence of small hitting sets for any explicitly described class of polynomials of polynomial degree.
  To complete the picture we show that the existence of such hitting sets is \emph{equivalent} to the surjective weak pigeonhole principle $\mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$, over the theory $\mathrm{S}^1_2$. This is a contribution to a line of research studying the reverse mathematics of computational complexity. One consequence of this is that the problem of constructing small hitting sets for such classes is complete for the class APEPP of explicit construction problems whose totality follows from the probabilistic method. This class is also known and studied as the class of Range Avoidance Problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Structural Games and Number of Quantifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14709v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-structural games, played on two sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of structures. These games generalize Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games. Whereas Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games capture the quantifier rank of a first-order sentence, multi-structural games capture the number of quantifiers, in the sense that Spoiler wins the $r$-round game if and only if there is a first-order sentence $\phi$ with at most $r$ quantifiers, where every structure in $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $\phi$ and no structure in $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies $\phi$. We use these games to give a complete characterization of the number of quantifiers required to distinguish linear orders of different sizes, and develop machinery for analyzing structures beyond linear orders.</description>

      <title>On Enumerating Short Projected Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propositional model enumeration, or All-SAT, is the task to record all models of a propositional formula. It is a key task in software and hardware verification, system engineering, and predicate abstraction, to mention a few. It also provides a means to convert a CNF formula into DNF, which is relevant in circuit design. While in some applications enumerating models multiple times causes no harm, in others avoiding repetitions is crucial. We therefore present two model enumeration algorithms, which adopt dual reasoning in order to shorten the found models. The first method enumerates pairwise contradicting models. Repetitions are avoided by the use of so-called blocking clauses, for which we provide a dual encoding. In our second approach we relax the uniqueness constraint. We present an adaptation of the standard conflict-driven clause learning procedure to support model enumeration without blocking clauses.Our procedures are expressed by means of a calculus and proofs of correctness are provided.</description>

      <title>Designing Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Social Welfare and Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In game theory, mechanism design is concerned with the design of incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is the first exploration of proof-theoretic semantics for a substructural logic. It focuses on the base-extension semantics (B-eS) for intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic (IMLL). The starting point is a review of Sandqvist's B-eS for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL), for which we propose an alternative treatment of conjunction that takes the form of the generalized elimination rule for the connective. The resulting semantics is shown to be sound and complete. This motivates our main contribution, a B-eS for IMLL, in which the definitions of the logical constants all take the form of their elimination rule and for which soundness and completeness are established.</description>

      <title>Tachis: Higher-Order Separation Logic with Credits for Expected Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Tachis, a higher-order separation logic to reason about the expected cost of probabilistic programs. Inspired by the uses of time credits for reasoning about the running time of deterministic programs, we introduce a novel notion of probabilistic cost credit. Probabilistic cost credits are a separation logic resource that can be used to pay for the cost of operations in programs, and that can be distributed across all possible branches of sampling instructions according to their weight, thus enabling us to reason about expected cost. The representation of cost credits as separation logic resources gives Tachis a great deal of flexibility and expressivity. In particular, it permits reasoning about amortized expected cost by storing excess credits as potential into data structures to pay for future operations. Tachis further supports a range of cost models, including running time and entropy usage. We showcase the versatility of this approach by applying our techniques to prove upper bounds on the expected cost of a variety of probabilistic algorithms and data structures, including randomized quicksort, hash tables, and meldable heaps.
  All of our results have been mechanized using Coq, Iris, and the Coquelicot real analysis library.</description>

      <title>Categorical Foundations of Formalized Condensed Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a  generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf for the coherent topology on a certain category of compact Hausdorff spaces. In this case, the sheaf condition has a fairly simple explicit description, which arises from studying the relationship between the coherent, regular and extensive topologies. In this paper, we establish this relationship under minimal assumptions on the category, going beyond the case of compact Hausdorff spaces. Along the way, we also provide a characterization of sheaves and covering sieves for these categories. All results in this paper have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
