      <title>A generalisation of the pencil of Kuribayashi-Komiya quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pencil of Kuribayashi-Komiya quartics $$ x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + t(x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2)=0 \, \mbox{ where } t \in \bar{\mathbb{C}} $$is a complex one-dimensional family of Riemann surfaces of genus three endowed with a group of automorphisms isomorphic to the symmetric group of order twenty-four. This pencil has been extensively studied from different points of view.
  This paper is aimed at studying, for each prime number $p \geqslant 5$, the pencil of \textit{generalised Kuribayashi-Komiya curves} $\mathcal{F}_p$, given by the curves $$x^{2p}+y^{2p}+z^{2p}+t(x^p y^p +x^p z^p +y^p z^p)=0\mbox{ where } t \in \bar{\mathbb{C}}.$$We determine the full automorphism group $G$ of each smooth member $X \in \mathcal{F}_p$ and study the action of $G$ and of its subgroups on $X$. In particular, we show that no member of the pencil is hyperelliptic. As a by-product, we derive a classification of all those Riemann surfaces of genus $(p-1)(2p-1)$ that are endowed with a group of automorphisms isomorphic to the full automorphism group of the generic smooth member of $\mathcal{F}_p.$</description>

      <title>An Alternative Model for Coherent Sheaves over Noetherian Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme is very important for studying the properties of a given scheme. For noetherian schemes it is a well-known fact that the topology can be fully recovered from the corresponding partially ordered set of its points together with the specializaion partial order. Here we show that the same thing holds for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme, i.e. there exists an equivalent description of this category in the "language" of this poset. First we build the equivalent notion of the structure sheaf, then we introduce the desired functor from the category of coherent sheaves to a certain category of presheaves over it, show this functor is fully faithful, describe its essential image and hence find an equivalent category for the category of coherent sheaves over a noetherian scheme. This paper is based on the author's master's thesis.</description>

      <title>Universally Equidimensional Morphisms and Weakly or Strongly rational Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this article is the study of a certain type of singularities and their transfer properties in a universally equidimensional morphism (i.e. an open morphism with constant pure-dimensional fibers). The singularities of interest are those called weakly rational, characterized by the vanishing of the (m-1)-th direct image of the structural sheaf in a given desingularization of a complex space of dimension $m$. If the singular locus of the considered space has codimension at least two, this condition is equivalent to the equality, in maximal degree, of the Grothendieck dualizing sheaves {\omega} and L (whose sections extend analytically across any resolution of singularities). We show that this type of singularity transfers from the fibers and the base to the total space. Moreover, if the morphism induces local holomorphic traces (meaning it is geometrically flat), there is a transfer from the total space to the base. Finally, under certain conditions ensuring the existence of a simultaneous resolution, there is a natural transfer from the total space to the fibers, provided the base itself has such singularities.</description>

      <title>An unusual family of supersingular curves of genus five</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of smooth supersingular curves of genus $5$ in characteristic $2$ with several notable features: its dimension matches the expected dimension of any component of the supersingular locus in genus $5$, its members are non-hyperelliptic curves with non-trivial automorphism groups, and each curve in the family admits a double cover structure over both an elliptic curve and a genus-$2$ curve. We also provide an explicit parametrization of this family.</description>

      <title>A Note on Categorical Entropy of Bielliptic Surfaces and Enriques Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that there exists an autoequivalence of positive categorical entropy on the derived category of certain bielliptic surfaces. This gives the first example of a surface admitting positive categorical entropy in the absence of both positive topological entropy and any spherical objects. Moreover, we prove a Gromov-Yomdin type equality for the categorical entropy of autoequivalences on bielliptic surfaces and give a counterexample of this equality on Enriques surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Hodge Cycles: A Novel Approach to the Hodge Conjecture via Generalized Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hodge Conjecture, posits a profound connection between the topology and algebraic geometry of complex algebraic varieties. It asserts that Hodge cycles, specific elements in the cohomology of a K\"ahler variety with rational properties, originate from algebraic subvarieties. This paper introduces a novel approach to investigate this conjecture by generalizing the concept of Zernike moments through the lens of harmonic analysis and spectral geometry. Our core idea involves defining a ``characteristic form'' $\eta_Z$ for a Hodge cycle $Z$ within a K\"ahler variety $X$, and expanding this form in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $Z$. We hypothesize that for algebraic Hodge cycles, the coefficients of this spectral expansion (termed ``spectral fingerprints'') will exhibit specific algebraic patterns, such as being rational numbers, algebraic numbers, or algebraic functions of moduli parameters. We illustrate the computational methodology with a simplified ``toy model'' using a characteristic function on a torus, demonstrating how such coefficients can indeed be rational in a controlled setting. We then outline a conceptual framework for applying this approach to more complex scenarios, specifically K3 surfaces, by leveraging the theory of variations of Hodge structures and moduli spaces to define ``dynamic characteristic forms'' and analyze the algebraic nature of their coefficients. This framework promises to open new avenues in understanding the Hodge Conjecture by translating a deep geometric problem into a question about the algebraic properties of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Representations of finite subgroups of Cremona groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cremona group of rank n over a field k is the group of birational automorphisms of the n-dimensional projective space over the field k. We study the minimal dimension such that all finite subgroups of the Cremona group have a faithful representation of that dimension over the same field. We find the exact value for rank 1 and 2 over all fields. We prove that the value is infinite for all fields of positive characteristic and rank greater than one. For many fields of characteristic 0, which include number fields and the complex field, we show that the value is finite for all ranks. Finally, for all fields of characteristic 0, we prove that the dimension is bounded below by a function that is exponential in the rank.</description>

Abstract: We consider rational projective homogeneous varieties over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, namely quotients of a semi-simple group by a possibly non-reduced parabolic subgroup. We determine the group scheme structure of the neutral component of their automorphism group, generalizing the classical result of Demazure on automorphism groups of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Brill--Noether loci in genus $\leq 12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A refined Brill--Noether theory seeks to determine which linear series are admitted by a ``general'' curve in a particular Brill--Noether locus. However, as Brill--Noether loci are not irreducible in general, a coarse answer is given by the relative positions of Brill--Noether loci. Via an analysis of unstable Lazarsfeld--Mukai bundles on K3 surfaces, we distinguish Brill--Noether loci and provide expectations for the relative positions of Brill--Noether loci in general. Together with classical results, the refined Brill--Noether theory for curves of fixed gonality and on Hirzebruch surfaces, and explicit constructions, we identify the relative positions of all Brill--Noether loci in genus $g\leq 11$, and all but one locus in genus 12.</description>

Abstract: Consider a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. We prove that \begin{align} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{h_{Y}(f^{n}(x))}{h_{H}(f^{n}(x)) } = 0, \end{align} where $h_{Y}$ is a height associated with a closed subscheme $Y \subset X$ of codimension $c$, $h_{H}$ is any ample height on $X$, and $x \in X(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ is a point with well-defined orbit, under the following assumptions: (1) either $f$ is a morphism, or $Y$ is pure dimensional, regularly embedded in $X$, and contained in the locus over which all iterates of $f$ are finite; (2) the orbit of $x$ is generic; (3) $d_{c}(f)^{1/c} &lt; \alpha_{f}(x)$, where $d_{c}(f)$ is the $c$-th dynamical degree of $f$ and $ \alpha_{f}(x)$ is the arithmetic degree of $x$.</description>

      <title>Newton numbers, vanishing polytopes and algebraic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a polynomial $f$ with a convenient Newton polytope $P$ and generic complex coefficients. By the global version of the Kouchnirenko formula, the hypersurface $\{f = 0\} \subset \mathbb C^n$ has the homotopy type of a bouquet of $(n-1)$-spheres, and the number of spheres is given by a certain alternating sum of volumes, called the Newton number $\nu(P)$. Using the Furukawa-Ito classification of dual defective sets, we classify convenient Newton polytopes with vanishing Newton numbers as certain Cayley sums called $B_k$-polytopes. These $B_k$-polytopes generalize the $B_1$- and $B_2$-facets appearing in the local monodromy conjecture in the Newton non-degenerate case. Our classification provides a partial solution to the Arnold's monotonicity problem.
  The local $h^*$-polynomial (or $\ell^*$-polynomial) is a natural invariant of lattice polytopes that refines the $h^*$-polynomial coming from Ehrhart theory. We obtain decomposition formulas for the Newton number, for instance, prove the inequality $\nu(P) \ge \ell^*(P;1)$. The $B_k$-polytopes are non-trivial examples of thin polytopes.
  We generalize the Newton number in two independent ways: the $\ell$-Newton number and the $e$-Newton number. The $\ell$-Newton number comes from Ehrhart theory, namely, from certain generalizations of Katz-Stapledon decomposition formulas. It is the main ingredient in the proof of the thinness of the $B_k$-polytopes. The $e$-Newton number is the number of points of zero-dimensional critical complete intersections. Vanishing of the $e$-Newton number characterizes the dual defective sets. The $e$-Newton number calculates the algebraic degrees (Maximum Likelihood, Euclidean Distance, and Polar degrees). For instance, we show that all the known formulas for the algebraic degrees in the Newton non-degenerate case are implied by basic properties of the $e$-Newton number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine, regular, and star triangulations (FRSTs) of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to toric varieties, within which generic anticanonical hypersurfaces yield smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds. We employ transformers -- deep learning models originally developed for language modeling -- to generate FRSTs across a range of polytope sizes. Our models exhibit efficient and unbiased sampling, and can self-improve through retraining on their own output. These results lay the foundation for AICY: a community-driven platform that combines self-improving machine learning models with a continuously expanding FRST database to explore and catalog the Calabi-Yau landscape.</description>

      <title>Spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Eulerian polynomials to the multivariate setting introduced by Br\"and\'en. Although initially these polynomials were introduced using the language of hyperbolic and stable polynomials, we manage to translate some restrictions of these polynomials to our real zero setting. Once we are in this setting, we focus our attention on the rigidly convex sets (RCSs) defined by these polynomials. In particular, we study the corresponding rigidly convex sets looking at spectrahedral relaxations constructed through the use of monic symmetric linear matrix polynomials (MSLMPs) of small size and depending polynomially (actually just cubically) on the coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. We analyze how good are the obtained spectrahedral approximations to these rigidly convex sets. We do this analysis by measuring the behavior along the diagonal, where we precisely recover the original univariate Eulerian polynomials. Thus we conclude that, measuring through the diagonal, our relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials is highly accurate. In particular, we see that this relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials provides bounds for the extreme roots of the corresponding univariate Eulerian polynomials that are better than these already found in the literature. All in all, this tells us that, at least close to the diagonal, the global outer approximation to the rigidly convex sets provided by this relaxation-based spectrahedral method is itself highly accurate.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Frobenius-Hecke traces of the etale cohomology of certain strata of Kottwitz varieties (which are certain compact unitary type Shimura varieties considered by Kottwitz), in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials. We obtain our results using the trace formula, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>

Abstract: In this paper we establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of degenerate fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We prove a new cuplength estimate, in particular including Arnol'd conjecture over complex numbers, for fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with two point insertions. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion.</description>

      <title>Differentiable structures on a union of two open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper the authors classified differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{L}$ called the line with two origins which is obtained by gluing two copies of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}\setminus 0$.
  Here we give a classification of differentiable structures on another non-Hausdorff one-dimensional manifold $\mathbb{Y}$ (called letter "$Y$") obtained by gluing two copies of $\mathbb{R}$ via the identity map of positive reals. It turns out that, in contrast to the real line, for every $r=1,\ldots,\infty$, both manifolds $\mathbb{L}$ and $\mathbb{Y}$ admit uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures.
  We also observe that the proofs of these classifications are very similar. This allows to formalize the arguments and extend them to a certain general statement about arrows in arbitrary categories.</description>

      <title>The fiber-full scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the fiber-full scheme which can be seen as the parameter space that generalizes the Hilbert and Quot schemes by controlling the entire cohomological data. The fiber-full scheme $\text{Fib}_{\mathcal{F}/X/S}^\mathbf{h}$ is a fine moduli space parametrizing all quotients $\mathcal{G}$ of a fixed coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on a projective morphism $f:X \subset \mathbb{P}_S^r \rightarrow S$ such that $R^i{{f}_*}\left(\mathcal{G}(\nu)\right)$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_S$-module of rank equal to $h_i(\nu)$, where $\mathbf{h} = (h_0,\ldots,h_r) : \mathbb{Z}^{r+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^{r+1}$ is a fixed tuple of functions. In other words, the fiber-full scheme controls the dimension of all cohomologies of all possible twistings, instead of just the Hilbert polynomial. We show that the fiber-full scheme is a quasi-projective $S$-scheme and a locally closed subscheme of its corresponding Quot scheme. In the context of applications, we demonstrate that the fiber-full scheme provides the natural parameter space for arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay and arithmetically Gorenstein schemes with fixed cohomological data, and for square-free Gr\"obner degenerations.</description>

Abstract: We develop an equivariant version of the non-archimedean Arakelov theory of [BGS95] in the case of toric varieties. We define the equivariant analogues of the non-archimedean differential forms and currents appearing in \emph{loc.~cit.} and relate them to piecewise polynomial functions on the polyhedral complexes defining the toric models. In particular, we give combinatorial characterizations of the Green currents associated to equivariant cycles and combinatorial descriptions of the arithmetic Chow groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we regard the smooth quadric threefold $Q_{3}$ as Lagrangian Grassmannian and search for fixed rational curves of low degree in $Q_{3}$ with respect to a torus action, which is the maximal subgroup of the special linear group $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Most of them are confirmations of very well-known facts. If the degree of a rational curve is $3$, it is confirmed using the Lagrangian's geometric properties that the moduli space of twisted cubic curves in $Q_3$ has a specific projective bundle structure. From this, we can immediately obtain the cohomology ring of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the moduli spaces of filtered $G$-local systems on curves for an arbitrary reductive group $G$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. This provides an algebraic construction for the Betti moduli spaces in the tame nonabelian Hodge correspondence for vector bundles/principal bundles on noncompact curves. As a direct application, the tame nonabelian Hodge correspondence on noncompact curves holds not only for the relevant categories, but also for the moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06058v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bicyclic pair is a smooth surface equipped with a pair of smooth divisors intersecting in two reduced points. Resolutions of self-nodal curves constitute an important special case. We investigate the logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory of bicyclic pairs. We establish correspondences with local Gromov-Witten theory and open Gromov-Witten theory in all genera, a correspondence with orbifold Gromov-Witten theory in genus zero, and correspondences between all-genus refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants and refined quiver Donaldson-Thomas invariants. For self-nodal curves in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,r)$ we obtain closed formulae for the genus zero invariants and relate these to the invariants of local curves. We also establish a conceptual relationship between invariants relative a self-nodal plane cubic and invariants relative a smooth plane cubic. The technical heart of the paper is a qualitatively new analysis of the degeneration formula for stable logarithmic maps, involving a tight intertwining of tropical and intersection-theoretic vanishing arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of $2n$ points in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is self-dual if it is invariant under the Gale transform. Motivated by Mukai's work on canonical curves, Petrakiev showed that a general self-dual set of $14$ points in $\mathbb{P}^6$ arises as the intersection of the Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}(2,6)$ in its Pl\"ucker embedding in $\mathbb{P}^{14}$ with a linear space of dimension $6$. In this paper we focus on the inverse problem of recovering such a linear space associated to a general self-dual set of points. We use numerical homotopy continuation to approach the problem and implement an algorithm in Julia to solve it. Along the way we also implement the forward problem of slicing Grassmannians and use it to experimentally study the real solutions to this problem.</description>

Abstract: A complex variety $X$ admits a cellular resolution of singularities if there exists a resolution of singularities $\widetilde X\to X$ such that its exceptional locus as well as $\widetilde X$ and the singular locus of $X$ admit a cellular decomposition. We give a concrete description of the motive with compact support of $X$ in terms of its Borel-Moore homology, under some mild conditions. We give many examples, including rational projective curves and toric varieties of dimension two and three.</description>

Abstract: The signature of a membrane is a sequence of tensors whose entries are iterated integrals. We study algebraic properties of membrane signatures, with a focus on signature matrices of polynomial and piecewise bilinear membranes. Generalizing known results for path signatures, we show that the two families of membranes admit the same set of signature matrices and we examine the corresponding affine varieties. In particular, we prove that there are no algebraic relations on signature matrices of membranes, in contrast to the path case. We complement our results by a linear time algorithm for the computation of signature tensors for piecewise bilinear membranes.</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We prove that holomorphic maps from an open subset of a complex smooth projective curve to a complex smooth projective rationally simply connected variety can be approximated by algebraic maps for the compact-open topology. This theorem can be applied in particular when the target is a smooth hypersurface of degree d in P^n with n greater than or equal to d^2-1. We deduce it from a more general result: the tight approximation property holds for rationally simply connected varieties over function fields of complex curves.</description>

We establish the invariance of N\'eron-Severi spaces, nef cones, effective cones, movable cones, and Mori chamber decompositions for a family of Fano type varieties after a generic finite base change. Additionally, we show the uniform behavior of the minimal model program for this family. These results are applied to the boundedness problem of Fano type varieties.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated Poncelet porism is usually studied for a pair of smooth conics that are in a general position. Here we discuss Poncelet porism in the real plane - affine or projective, when that is not the case, i.e. the conics have at least one point of tangency or at least one of the conics is not smooth. In all such cases, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an n-gon inscribed in one of the conics and circumscribed about the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of hierarchical depth for line bundles on smooth projective surfaces, defined via filtrations by line subbundles with successive quotients supported on effective divisors. This invariant helps to investigate both the algebraic and geometric complexity of line bundles through discrete stepwise constructions. We study some of its basic properties, including functorial behavior under restriction to curves and compatibility with ampleness and base-point freeness. Applying this framework to algebraic geometry (AG) codes, we show that hierarchical filtrations yield natural code families whose combinatorial parameters (dimension, minimum distance) evolve predictably across the filtration.</description>

Each block admits a monadic description in terms a certain monad related to the homology of Steinberg varieties; this monad carries a filtration (the Mackey filtration) whose associated graded functor is given by the action of the relative Weyl group. Furthermore, we show that the Mackey filtration is generally non-split and thus the Springer-theoretic description of the entire equivariant derived category of $D$-modules appears to be substantially more subtle than either the case of the abelian category in earlier work of the author, or the derived category of nilpotent orbital sheaves in work of Rider and Russell. One notable feature of this setting is that the parabolic induction and restriction functors depend on the choice of parabolic subgroup containing a given Levi factor.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Successive Minima of Orders in Number Fields and Scrollar Invariants of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orders and fractional ideals in number fields provide interesting examples of lattices. We ask: what lattices arise from orders in number fields? We prove that all nontrivial multiplicative constraints on successive minima of orders come from multiplication. Moreover, inspired by a conjecture of Lenstra, for infinitely many positive integers $n$ (including all $n &lt; 18$), we explicitly determine all multiplicative constraints on successive minima of orders in degree $n$ number fields. We also prove analogous results for scrollar invariants of curves.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid signature, perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, and an application to local fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a (perfectoid) mixed characteristic version of $F$-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity by utilizing the perfectoidization functor of Bhatt-Scholze and Faltings' normalized length (also developed in the work of Gabber-Ramero). We show that these definitions coincide with the classical theory in equal characteristic $p &gt; 0$. We prove that a ring is regular if and only if either its perfectoid signature or perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is 1 and we show that perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity characterizes BCM closure and extended plus closure of $m$-primary ideals. We demonstrate that perfectoid signature detects BCM-regularity and transforms similarly to $F$-signature or normalized volume under quasi-\'etale maps. As a consequence, we prove that BCM-regular rings have finite local \'etale fundamental group and also finite torsion part of their divisor class groups. Finally, we also define a mixed characteristic version of relative rational signature, and show it characterizes BCM-rational singularities.</description>

      <title>A Chebotarev Density Theorem over Local Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00294v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the $p$-adic densities of points with a given splitting type along a (generically) finite map, analogous to the classical Chebotarev theorem over number fields and function fields. Under some mild hypotheses, we prove that these densities satisfy a functional equation in the size of the residue field. This functional equation is a direct reflection of Poincar\'e duality in \'etale cohomology. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Bhargava, Cremona, Fisher, and Gajovi\'c on factorization densities of p-adic polynomials.
  The key tool is the notion of admissible pairs associated to a group, which we use as an invariant of the inertia and decomposition action of a local field on the fibers of the finite map. We compute the splitting densities by M\"obius inverting certain p-adic integrals along the poset of admissible pairs. The conjecture on factorization densities follows immediately for tamely ramified primes from our general results. We reduce the complete conjecture (including the wild primes) to the existence of an explicit "Tate-type" resolution of the "resultant locus" over the integers and complete the proof of the conjecture by constructing this resolution.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$ and $W(k)$ its ring of Witt vectors. We construct an equivalence of categories between the full subcategory of the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the syntomification of $W(k)$ spanned by objects whose Hodge-Tate weights are between $[0,p-2]$ and an appropriate derived category of Fontaine-Laffaille modules.</description>

      <title>Semi-stable and splitting models for unitary Shimura varieties over ramified places. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Shimura varieties associated to a unitary group of signature $(n-1, 1)$. For these varieties, we construct $p$-adic integral models over odd primes $p$ which ramify in the imaginary quadratic field with level subgroup at $p$ given by the stabilizer of a vertex lattice in the hermitian space. Our models are given by a variation of the construction of the splitting models of Pappas-Rapoport and they have a simple moduli theoretic description. By an explicit calculation, we show that these splitting models are normal, flat, Cohen-Macaulay and with reduced special fiber. In fact, they have relatively simple singularities: we show that a single blow-up along a smooth codimension one subvariety of the special fiber produces a semi-stable model. This also implies the existence of semi-stable models of the corresponding Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>The Rees algebra and analytic spread of a divisorial filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some properties of Rees algebras of divisorial filtrations and their analytic spread. A classical theorem of McAdam shows that the analytic spread of an ideal $I$ in a formally equidimensional local ring is equal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an associated prime of $R/\overline{I^n}$ for some $n$. We show in Theorem 1.5 that McAdam's theorem holds for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over an excellent local ring of dimension less than or equal to 3. This generalizes an earlier result for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does not hold for more general filtrations.
  We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function $n\mapsto \lambda_R(R/I_n)$ for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ of $m_R$-primary ideals on a $d$-dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is known from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity $$ e(\mathcal I)=d! \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(R/I_n)}{n^d} $$ can be irrational. We show in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function $$ \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(I_n/I_{n+1})}{n^{d-1}} $$ is always finite for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration. We then give an example in Section 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit.
  In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration $\{P^{(n)}\}$ of a prime ideal $P$ in a normal two dimensional excellent local ring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic powers $P^{(n)}$ of $P$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of directed-cycle and catenary linear compartment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions
  and its homological countparts. The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a well-approximating sequence of stable bundles. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional and bound the $L^\infty$ norm of Hermitian-Einstein metrics. We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A 2-adic automorphy lifting theorem for symplectic groups over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new automorphy lifting theorem for certain 2-adic Galois representations $\rho:G_F\longrightarrow {\rm GSp}_{2n}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_2)$ where $F$ an arbitrary totally real field. This extends the minimal case previously established by Thorne to the non-minimal case. A key ingredient is a detailed analysis for the residual monodromy representations associated to the Dwork family in characteristic two. As an application, combining with the author's previous work with Tsuzuki, we prove the automorphy of certain rank 4 symplectic motives over $F$ coming from the Dwork quintic family under suitable conditions.</description>
