      <title>Lurie's Unstraightening as a weak biequivalence of $\infty$-cosmoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a direct proof of the fact that Lurie's Unstraightening functor induces an equivalence between the strict $(\infty,2)$-category of indexed quasi-categories and the strict $(\infty,2)$-category of fibered quasi-categories over any given quasi-categorical base. We conclude that Unstraightening preserves simplicial cotensors up to a (strictly) natural homotopy equivalence, and thus gives rise to an accordingly weakened notion of cosmological biequivalence between the two underlying $\infty$-cosmoses.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

      <title>A Type Theory with a Tiny Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of Martin-L\"of Type Theory that contains a tiny object; a type for which there is a right adjoint to the formation of function types as well as the expected left adjoint. We demonstrate the practicality of this type theory by proving various properties related to tininess internally and suggest a few potential applications.</description>

      <title>Constructing monads from cubical diagrams and homotopy colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first step in a general program for defining cocalculus towers of functors via sequences of compatible monads. Goodwillie's calculus of homotopy functors inspired many new functor calculi in a wide range of contexts in algebra, homotopy theory and geometric topology. Recently, the third and fourth authors have developed a general program for constructing generalized calculi from sequences of compatible comonads. In this paper, we dualize the first step of the Hess-Johnson program, focusing on monads rather than comonads. We consider categories equipped with an action of the poset category $\mathcal{P}(n)$, called $\mathcal{P}(n)$-modules. We exhibit a functor from $\mathcal{P}(n)$-modules to the category of monads. The resulting monads act on categories of functors whose codomain is equipped with a suitable notion of homotopy colimits. In the final section of the paper, we demonstrate the monads used to construct McCarthy's dual calculus as an example of a monad arising from a $\mathcal{P}(n)$-module. This confirms that our dualization of the Hess-Johnson program generalizes McCarthy's dual calculus, and serves as a proof of concept for further development of this program.</description>

      <title>The categorical spin-statistics theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the framework of Atiyah. We incorporate spin via spin structures on bordisms, and represent statistics using super vector spaces. Unitarity is implemented using dagger categories, in a manner that is equivalent to the approach of Freed-Hopkins, who employed $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant functors to address reflection-positivity. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the notion of fermionically dagger compact categories, which extends the well-established concept of dagger compact categories. We show that both the spin bordism category and the category of super Hilbert spaces are examples of fermionically dagger compact categories. The spin-statistics theorem for TQFTs emerges as a specific case of a more general result concerning symmetric monoidal dagger functors between fermionically dagger compact categories.</description>

      <title>Graphical Quadratic Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Graphical Quadratic Algebra (GQA), a string diagrammatic calculus extending the language of Graphical Affine Algebra with a new generator characterised by invariance under rotation matrices. We show that GQA is a sound and complete axiomatisation for three different models: quadratic relations, which are a compositional formalism for least-squares problems, Gaussian stochastic processes, and Gaussian stochastic processes extended with non-determinisms. The equational theory of GQA sheds light on the connections between these perspectives, giving an algebraic interpretation to the interplay of stochastic behaviour, relational behaviour, non-determinism, and conditioning. As applications, we discuss various case studies, including linear regression, probabilistic programming, and electrical circuits with realistic (noisy) components.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part I: Invertible Symmetries and Higher Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $q$-charges describe the possible actions of a generalized symmetry on $q$-dimensional operators. In Part I of this series of papers, we describe $q$-charges for invertible symmetries; while the discussion of $q$-charges for non-invertible symmetries is the topic of Part II. We argue that $q$-charges of a standard global symmetry, also known as a 0-form symmetry, correspond to the so-called $(q+1)$-representations of the 0-form symmetry group, which are natural higher-categorical generalizations of the standard notion of representations of a group. This generalizes already our understanding of possible charges under a 0-form symmetry! Just like local operators form representations of the 0-form symmetry group, higher-dimensional extended operators form higher-representations. This statement has a straightforward generalization to other invertible symmetries: $q$-charges of higher-form and higher-group symmetries are $(q+1)$-representations of the corresponding higher-groups. There is a natural extension to higher-charges of non-genuine operators (i.e. operators that are attached to higher-dimensional operators), which will be shown to be intertwiners of higher-representations. This brings into play the higher-categorical structure of higher-representations. We also discuss higher-charges of twisted sector operators (i.e. operators that appear at the boundary of topological operators of one dimension higher), including operators that appear at the boundary of condensation defects.</description>

      <title>Model theory in compactly generated (tensor-)triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an account of model theory in the context of compactly generated triangulated and tensor-triangulated categories ${\cal T}$. We describe pp formulas, pp-types and free realisations in such categories and we prove elimination of quantifiers and elimination of imaginaries. We compare the ways in which definable subcategories of ${\cal T}$ may be specified. Then we link definable subcategories of ${\cal T}$ and finite-type torsion theories on the category of modules over the compact objects of ${\cal T}$. We briefly consider spectra and dualities. If ${\cal T}$ is tensor-triangulated then new features appear, in particular there is an internal duality in rigidly-compactly generated tensor-triangulated categories.</description>
