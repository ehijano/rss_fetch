      <title>Distributional Reference Class Forecasting of Corporate Sales Growth With Multiple Reference Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to reference class selection in distributional forecasting with an application to corporate sales growth rates using several co-variates as reference variables, that are implicit predictors. The method can be used to detect expert or model-based forecasts exposed to (behavioral) bias or to forecast distributions with reference classes. These are sets of similar entities, here firms, and rank based algorithms for their selection are proposed, including an optional preprocessing data dimension reduction via principal components analysis. Forecasts are optimal if they match the underlying distribution as closely as possible. Probability integral transform values rank the forecast capability of different reference variable sets and algorithms in a backtest on a data set of 21,808 US firms over the time period 1950 - 2019. In particular, algorithms on dimension reduced variables perform well using contemporaneous balance sheet and financial market parameters along with past sales growth rates and past operating margins changes. Comparisions of actual analysts' estimates to distributional forecasts and of historic distributional forecasts to realized sales growth illustrate the practical use of the method.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-Policy Gradient for Online Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches, this paper proposes and analyzes an $\epsilon$-policy gradient algorithm for the online pricing learning task. The algorithm extends $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm by replacing greedy exploitation with gradient descent step and facilitates learning via model inference. We optimize the regret of the proposed algorithm by quantifying the exploration cost in terms of the exploration probability $\epsilon$ and the exploitation cost in terms of the gradient descent optimization and gradient estimation errors. The algorithm achieves an expected regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ (up to a logarithmic factor) over $T$ trials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Sentiment: Can Large Language Models Predict Chinese Stock Price Movements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about their potential to enhance quantitative trading strategies. LLMs excel in analyzing sentiments about listed companies from financial news, providing critical insights for trading decisions. However, the performance of LLMs in this task varies substantially due to their inherent characteristics. This paper introduces a standardized experimental procedure for comprehensive evaluations. We detail the methodology using three distinct LLMs, each embodying a unique approach to performance enhancement, applied specifically to the task of sentiment factor extraction from large volumes of Chinese news summaries. Subsequently, we develop quantitative trading strategies using these sentiment factors and conduct back-tests in realistic scenarios. Our results will offer perspectives about the performances of Large Language Models applied to extracting sentiments from Chinese news texts.</description>

      <title>Emoji Driven Crypto Assets Market Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, social media platforms like Twitter have become pivotal in influencing market trends and investor sentiments. In our study, we leverage GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for a multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on the impact of emoji sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators like BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture's analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT's pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends. Crucially, our findings suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can facilitate the avoidance of significant market downturns and contribute to the stabilization of returns. This research underscores the practical benefits of integrating advanced AI-driven analyses into financial strategies, offering a nuanced perspective on the interplay between digital communication and market dynamics in an academic context.</description>
