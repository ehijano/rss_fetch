      <title>Fast Recovery Dynamics of GaSbBi-based SESAMs for high-fluence operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelocked lasers operating at 2-3 um wavelength region are interesting for various spectroscopic applications. To this end, GaSb-based semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs) are developing fast as a practical technology for passive modelocking. Yet, such SESAMs suffer from either too high two-photon absorption or slow absorption recovery dynamics. This study introduces GaSbBi quantum wells (QWs) as a novel platform to ensure a larger material selection for engineering GaSb-based SESAMs with decreased two-photon absorption and ultrafast absorption recovery time. Three GaSbBi QW SESAM designs were fabricated to compare their performance against conventional GaInSb QW SESAMs. The first structure makes use of typical GaSb barriers and exhibits comparable characteristics to the conventional design, including a saturation fluence of 1.09 uJ/cm^2, modulation depth of 1.41%, and a fast interband recovery time of 6.03 ps. The second design incorporated AlAs0.08Sb0.92 barriers, achieving reduced two-photon absorption, though at the cost of higher non-saturable losses due to unintended Bi droplet formation during growth of the AlAs0.08Sb0.92/GaSbBi QW heterostructure. Importantly, it maintained a fast interband recovery time (30 ps), overcoming the slow recovery dynamics exhibited by standard GaInSb QW SESAMs with AlAs0.08Sb0.92 barriers. The third design explored GaSbBi QWs with higher Bi content targeted for longer wavelength operation at 2.3 um, which exhibited fast recovery times and good nonlinear reflectivity characteristics. However, the higher Bi content resulted in elevated non-saturable losses. These results highlight the potential of GaSbBi QWs for SWIR SESAMs, opening the path for further epitaxial optimization to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Broadband acousto-optic modulators on Silicon Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress-optic modulators are emerging as a necessary building block of photonic integrated circuits tasked with controlling and manipulating classical and quantum optical systems. While photonic platforms such as lithium niobate and silicon on insulator have well developed modulator ecosystems, silicon nitride so far does not. As silicon nitride has favorable optical properties, such as ultra-low-loss and a large optical transparency window, a rich ecosystem of potential photonic integrated circuits are therefore inhibited. Here we demonstrate a traveling wave optically broadband acousto-optic spiral modulator architecture at a wavelength of 1550 nm using 90 nm thick silicon nitride waveguides and demonstrate their use in an optomechanical sensing system. The spiral weaves the light repeatedly through the acoustic field up to 38 times, factoring in the time evolution of the acoustic field during the light's transit through spirals up to 26 cm in length. These modulators avoid heterogeneous integration, release processes, complicated fabrication procedures, and modifications of the commercial foundry fabricated photonic layer stack by exploiting ultra-low-loss waveguides to enable long phonon-photon interaction lengths required for efficient modulation. The design allows for thick top oxide cladding of 4 $\mu$m such that the low loss optical properties of thin silicon nitride can be preserved, ultimately achieving a $V_\pi$ of 8.98 V at 704 MHz with 1.13 dB of insertion loss. Our modulators are the first optically broadband high frequency acousto-optic modulators on thin silicon nitride, and the novel architecture is accessible to any low loss photonic platform. We demonstrate an immediate use case for these devices in a high-Q optomechanical sensing system.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Elastic Metamaterials for Zero-Frequency and Zero-Wavenumber Bandgaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create wave-matter space-time metamaterials using optical trapping forces to manipulate mass-spring chains and create zero-frequency and zero-wavenumber band gaps: the bosonic nature of phonons, and hence this elastodynamic setting, traditionally prohibits either zero-frequency or zero-wavenumber band gaps. Here, we generate zero-frequency gaps using optomechanical interactions within a 3D mass-spring chain by applying an optical trapping force to hold or manipulate a mass in a contactless manner independent of its elastodynamic excitations. Through careful modification of the geometrical parameters in the trapped monoatomic mass-spring chain, we demonstrate the existence of a zero-frequency gap generated by the optical forces on the masses. The precise control we have over the system allows us to drive another set of masses and springs out of phase with its traveling wave thereby creating a zero-wavenumber band gap.</description>

      <title>Instantons and Rarefaction Pulses as Pathways to Global Phase Coherence in Gain-Based Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to reliably remove unwanted global phase windings in gain-based optical oscillator networks, thereby ensuring convergence to the true synchronized configuration corresponding to the XY Hamiltonian's global minimum. Focusing on one-dimensional rings and two-dimensional toroidal lattices, we show that two key strategies greatly enhance the probability of reaching the defect-free state. First, operating at a low effective injection rate just above threshold, exploits the amplitude degree of freedom, allowing the system to form transient zero-amplitude holes: instantons in one dimension, or vortex-antivortex rarefaction pulses in two-dimensional space, that enable phase slips. Second, preparing the initial condition with amplitude or phase inhomogeneities can directly seed these amplitude collapses and prevent the system from getting trapped in higher-energy states with nonzero winding. Using the Stuart--Landau and Ginzburg--Landau equations as models for fast-reservoir lasers, we derive analytic and numerical evidence that even relatively minor amplitude dips can trigger global unwinding in 1D. We further demonstrate that the pump's slow annealing favours these amplitude-driven events, leading to improved success in finding the globally coherent ground state. These findings highlight the critical role of amplitude freedom in analogue solvers for XY optimization problems, showing how local amplitude suppression provides a direct route to ejecting topological defects.</description>

      <title>Measuring $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in dimer models and cross-coupled ladders with a programmable photonic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological models are characterized by a quantized topological invariant and provide a description of novel phases of matter that can exhibit localized edge states, corner modes, and chiral transport. We experimentally realize two 1-D lattices supporting symmetry-protected topology - the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) and extended SSH models using the synthetic frequency dimension of coupled fiber ring resonators. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate cascaded heterodyning as a technique for low-noise, single-shot winding number measurements through the mean chiral displacement and band structure measurements. Through our robust setup and detection techniques we can extend our capability to realizing 1-D ladder models, demonstrating a modified Creutz ladder with a staggered flux with each plaquette. This highly reconfigurable and compact fiber optics platform for Hamiltonian simulation, along with a low-noise detection scheme, provides a path forward for chip-scale realizations.</description>

      <title>Rotation-tuned single hexagonal air cavity assisting in third-harmonic generation via hybrid modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fillable air cavity with a high quality (Q) factor and large-scale electric field confinement is highly desired in many optical applications. Yet, it remains challenging due to the dielectric transparency and metal loss in optical and near-infrared regimes. Here, we present a rotated hexagonal air cavity embedded in an Ag-air-Ag waveguide. Under near-infrared excitation, evanescent waves tunnel into the cavity. In addition to the whispering gallery mode and surface plasmon polaritons, the cavity also induces Fabry-P\'erot (FP) resonance, whose orientation is tunable via cavity rotation. Thus, our cavity possesses much stronger field confinement and higher Q than a circular cavity lacking FP resonance. The waveguide exhibits suppressed backward reflection filtering and Fano-type lineshapes. Then, integrating a silicon cylinder into the cavity, we demonstrate linear tuning of Mie resonances via radius adjustment. When the electric dipole (ED) resonance is excited, energy is predominantly confined within the cylinder. Different Mie modes will change the orientation of the FP resonance. Furthermore, the hybrid modes with ED resonance induce the third-harmonic wave of green light. These findings offer a promising strategy for designing high-Q air cavities for next-generation multifunctional electro-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Wavelength Multiplexing Reliable Photonic Integrated General-Purpose Analog Computing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the "post-Moore era", the growing challenges in traditional computing have driven renewed interest in analog computing, leading to various proposals for the development of general-purpose analog computing (GPAC) systems. In this work, we present a GPAC prototype featuring a silicon photonic chip designed for fully optical analog computation. This system leverages on-chip multi-channel architectures to enable parallel processing and utilizes wavelength-division multiplexing to significantly enhance computational capacity. In addition, we have developed an error-correction algorithm to monitor processing operations in real time, ensuring the reliability of computational results. Experimentally, we demonstrate the system's capability to solve ordinary differential equations and its applications in communications, microwave photonics, and image processing. The chip's energy efficiency is evaluated to reach up to 227 tera-operations per second per watt. Through this research, we provide a novel hardware framework and innovative directions for analog photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-disorder-induced localization of light in non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-independent spatial disorder can be inhibited, a ubiquitous phenomenon known as Anderson localization, arising from the destructive interference of scattered waves. In contrast, dephasing and decoherence, commonly present in out-of-equilibrium systems, are widely recognized to suppress wave interference and thus destroy Anderson localization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that dephasing can instead induce localization in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, where the eigenstates would otherwise remain delocalized under coherent dynamics. Specifically, the dephasing in our system is realized through uncorrelated spacetime disorder; we thus term the observed phenomenon "spacetime-disorder-induced localization." Our experiments are performed in optical synthetic quasicrystals featuring an incommensurate imaginary potential and a real potential subjected to spacetime disorder. Also, surprisingly, unlike Hermitian quasicrystals where the spacetime disorder obliterates Anderson metal-insulator transition, our non-Hermitian quasicrystals exhibit an exceptionally robust transition against the spacetime disorder. Our experiments challenge the conventional understanding of Anderson localization and open avenues for exploring the unusual interplay between non-Hermiticity, spacetime disorder, and phase transition in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>High-speed multiwavelength photonic temporal integration using silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical systems have been pivotal for energy-efficient computing, performing high-speed, parallel operations in low-loss carriers. While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.</description>

      <title>Unraveling cavity-like modes of two-dimensional broad band hyperbolic metamaterial and their coupling to quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) are artificially engineered materials that exhibit hyperbolic dispersion of light propagating through them. These have been extensively studied for tailoring light propagation. Most studies use an effective medium approach that is extremely useful, though it misses out on properties that can arise from the microscopic details of the HMM. In particular, the HMM can have cavity-like modes, and it is important to understand such modes and their relevance in light propagation and coupling of HMM to quantum emitters. In this work, we bring out the cavity-like modes of the silver nanowire-alumina two-dimensional HMM, which remain on top of the broad response of the HMM. These modes define the characteristic reflection spectra. The observed resonances and their widths are in good agreement with our simulations. These well-defined modes occur even though the metallic part of the HMM has Ohmic losses. Then, we present experimental results on the coupling of quantum emitters to the cavity-like modes of the HMM. We present results for both steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Using these, we extract the corresponding Purcell factors for radiative rate enhancement. Theoretical analyses of the experimental data allow the determination of the cavity coupling parameters and mode volumes. These experimental results are confirmed by the FDTD calculations for the HMM mode volume. This work elucidates the pathway to precise engineering for future applications of HMM modes in strong light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared quantum scanning microscopy via visible light beyond spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum spans from 2- to 25-$\mu \mathrm{m}$, serving as a valuable tool for accessing rich chemical information. Functional groups, lipids, and other complex molecules can be analyzed by optical absorption measurements due to their vibrational modes in the MIR spectral region. Over the past few decades, this field has faced challenges due to difficulties in generating MIR light and the limited maturity of detection systems in this spectral range. Quantum imaging with undetected light (QIUL) provides a spectrally tuneable photon-pair source, in which the sample can be illuminated with MIR light while visible (VIS) light is employed for detection and image reconstruction, overcoming the detection limitations and benefiting from the rich chemical information of the MIR spectral region. All previous QIUL implementations are based on spatial correlations, which are never perfect and thus hindered the imaging performance. In this work, we implement a raster-scanning QIUL method that is independent of the strength of the spatial correlations and achieves a spatial resolution beyond the limitations of these correlations.</description>

      <title>Antenna-coupled integrated millimeterwave modulators and resonant electro-optic frequency combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of global data traffic is accelerating the need for ultra-broadband communication technologies, particularly in inter-data center links and emerging 6G wireless systems. Applications such as optical computing and quantum information processing further demand fast, scalable ways to interface optical and electronic signals. Integrated electro-optic modulators offer a compact and efficient solution, but extending their operation into the millimeterwave (mmWave) and terahertz regimes is difficult. Key challenges include high transmission line losses and bulky electrical packaging. Here, we demonstrate a wireless and wideband electro-optic modulation architecture that directly interfaces wireless mmWave signals with optical ones, eliminating the need for impedance-matched mmWave probes and cables. By integrating an on-chip antenna directly with a co-designed traveling-wave transmission line on thin-film lithium niobate, we achieve spectrally flat phase modulation across the WR9.0 (82-125 GHz) and WR2.8 (240-380 GHz) bands. The wideband nature of our modulator enables the device to function as a high-speed mmWave detector. By modulating the mmWave carrier at frequencies up to 6 GHz, we demonstrate the device's flat and wide detection bandwidth-critical for 6G communication and high-speed mmWave sensing. Beyond traveling-wave detection, our wireless platform enables resonant electro-optic frequency comb generation with mode spacing of 123.2 GHz and 307.9 GHz. Extracted single-photon electro-optic coupling rates of $g_{eo} =2\pi\times 10.61$ kHz and 25.99 kHz, at 123.2 and 307.9 GHz, respectively, demonstrate favorable scaling with mmWave frequency. These results establish a new class of broadband, wireless electro-optic devices for high-speed modulation, detection, and frequency comb generation, with promising applications in communications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dissipative solitons in parity-time symmetric laser cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of optically coherent ultrashort pulses by mode-locked lasers has revolutionized advancements in modern science and technology. These pulses often arise from the formation of dissipative solitons, which emerge due to a balance between energy excitation and dissipation. Harnessing the concept of parity-time (PT) symmetry to control this balance, we demonstrate a new type of laser dissipative solitons hosted in linearly coupled ring cavities. Our experiments are performed in a laser where the linear hybridized modes are in the PT-symmetric phase. We experimentally observe the formation of short pulses, stabilized by the selective breaking of the PT-symmetry by the Kerr nonlinearity. Our results unlock new possibilities for passive mode-locking by showing spontaneous pulse formation in PT-symmetric lasers without the need for additional intricate components such as saturable absorber or non-reciprocal and polarisation sensitive elements.</description>

      <title>Many body effects in the line radiative transfer equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation for spectral lines from an extended gas is derived from first principles, treating the gas as a system of many atoms/molecules rather than isolated ones. Line broadening effects are assumed to be dominated by particle motions (Doppler effect), but collisional broadening effects are included in the impact approximation. We retrieve the canonical radiative transfer equation under the condition that the optical depth over a coherence length, defined as the transition-levels lifetime times the speed of light, is much lower than unity. For other cases, the line radiative transfer equation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends exponentially on the coherent optical depth. We compute that many-body effects affect line radiative transfer of strongly emitting and astronomically ubiquitous radio- and submillimter lines, such as the HI 21 cm line, and rotational transitions of the main isotopologue of CO. These results imply that care must be taken when interpreting observations relying on these lines, as many-body effects can significantly alter emergent line profiles and bias inferred physical conditions of the emitting gas.</description>

      <title>Quantum CNOT Gate with Actively Synchronized Photon Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor. We achieve a truth-table fidelity exceeding 85% and demonstrate Bell- inequality violation for all four Bell states. The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Mixed Quantum-Classical Approach for Many-Body Quantum Dynamics of Exciton-Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use a mixed quantum-classical (mean-field) many-body approach for simulating the quantum dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons beyond the single-excitation subspace. We combine the multitrajectory Ehrenfest approach, which propagates slow degrees of freedom classically, with the Gross-Pitaevskii method, which propagates fast degrees of freedom in a mean-field fashion. We use this mean-field many-body Ehrenfest approach to analyze how the phonon-induced dynamic disorder and the many-body interaction affect the incoherent and coherent dynamics of excitons and exciton-polaritons. We examine how the number of excitations and the strength of repulsive exciton-exciton interaction nonlinearly influence the transport, Fr\"ohlich scattering and decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an elegant method for continuous electrical-tuning of plasmo-mechanical displacement and squeezing without changing plasmonic gap size. Recent experiments bend the mechanical oscillator (cantilever) in units of nm via electrostatic actuators. We do not bend the cantilever but merely electrically-tune the gap intensity, so plasmo-mechanical coupling, via Fano resonance. This allows continuous displacement tuning in units of mechanical oscillator length that is about 30 fm in the experiments. This way, coupling strength can be tuned by 2 orders-of-magnitude via only a 1 V potential difference. Response time is picoseconds. Moreover, quadrature-squeezing (entanglement) of the oscillator can also be tuned continuously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are known to retain quantum optical properties --such assqueezing-- over significantly longer distances than their classical field amplitudes. While this resilience has been recognized for over two decades, the residual squeezing typically becomes so small that detecting it requires millions of measurements. In this work, we show that encoding classical data (bits or dits) into the "degree of squeezing" of a single-mode squeezed "noisy" state enablesefficient transmission through plasmonic nanowires. Remarkably, this approach allows the encoded information to be recovered even at long propagation distances using only a few measurements --far outperforming both squeezed non-noisy states and amplitude-based encoding schemes.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a novel, composite laser written 3D waveguide, fabricated in boro-aluminosilicate glass, with a refractive index contrast of 1.12 x 10^-2. The waveguide is fabricated using a multi-pass approach which leverages the respective refractive index modification mechanisms of both the thermal and athermal inscription regimes. We present the study and optimisation of inscription parameters for maximising positive refractive index change and ultimately demonstrate a dramatic advancement on the state of the art of bend losses in laser-written waveguides. The 1.0 dB cm^-1 bend loss cut-off radius is reduced from 10 mm to 4 mm, at a propagation wavelength of 1550 nm.</description>

Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) optomechanical resonators are a promising technology for the simultaneous control and measurement of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. They offer potential for use across a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers. Double-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and optical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly attractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated fabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been demonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of double-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate functional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical coupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical quality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical coupling of approximately 15 kHz.</description>

      <title>Tailoring light to create invariant modal spectra through complex channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light's spatial degree of freedom is emerging as a potential resource for a myriad of applications, in both classical and quantum domains, including secure communication, sensing and imaging. However, it has been repeatedly shown that a complex medium (atmosphere, optical fibre, turbid media, etc.) can perturb the spatial amplitude, phase and polarization of the structured light fields leading to a degradation in their performance. A promising solution to this is the use of invariant modes to whom the medium appears transparent. While the creation and robustness of these modes has been experimentally demonstrated, they are difficult to implement in many important applications due to large channel matrices, a susceptibility to numerical artefacts, non-physical solutions and unreliable performance. In this work, we outline a procedure for determining these invariant modes using a modal basis, which results in a set of eigenmodes that are free of these issues, are consistently realisable and require a much smaller channel matrix to compute. Using atmospheric turbulence and LG modes as the underlying basis as an illustrative example, we find robust modes for a variety of turbulence strengths with a basis of only 231 modes, one order of magnitude smaller than previous approaches. These modes consistently show a fidelity of above 80% after propagating through the complex channel, a significant improvement over sending the individual LG modes themselves and reveal an invariant modal spectrum through the channel. Our approach will work for any complex medium and modal basis, paving the way for the effective implementation of the eigenmode approach in real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Cell Wall Heterogeneity for Aspergillus Fumigatus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) enables nanoscale chemical mapping of biological structures, providing high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio imaging into molecular distribution and interactions beyond the capabilities of conventional Raman imaging. However, challenges such as the deformation of fragile biological cells and the complexity of signal interpretation would increase the difficulty in investigating biological samples with TERS. Here, we demonstrate using TERS to investigate the cell wall heterogeneity of Aspergillus fumigatus spores. Using TERS imaging and spectral analysis, we map the chemical components including melanin within the fungal cell wall. The results reveal distinct spectral features associated with polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins. Furthermore, by comparing the wild-type and albino mutant spores, we illuminate the biochemical characteristics of Dihydroxynaphthalene melanin (DHN-melanin) in the fungal cell wall.</description>

      <title>SMILE: a universal tool for modulated-enhanced localization microscopy to achieve minimal three-dimensional resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulation-enhanced localization microscopy (MELM) has demonstrated significant improvements in both lateral and axial localization precision compared to conventional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). However, lateral modulated illumination based MELM (MELMxy) remains fundamentally limited to two-dimensional imaging. Here we present three-dimensional Single-Molecule Modulated Illumination Localization Estimator (SMILE) that synergistically integrates lateral illumination modulation with point spread function engineering. By simultaneously exploiting lateral modulation patterns and an accurate point spread function (PSF) model for 3D localization, SMILE achieves near-theoretical-minimum localization uncertainty, demonstrating an average 4-fold enhancement in lateral precision compared to conventional 3D-SMLM. Crucially, SMILE exhibits exceptional compatibility with diverse PSFs and different illumination patterns with various structures including 4Pi configurations, making it a versatile tool that can be easily adapted for different experimental setups. When integrated with 4Pi microscopy, 4Pi-SMILE shows particular promise for achieving sub-10 nm axial resolution and approaching isotropic resolution. From the simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, we verified the superiority of SMILE over 3D-SMLM and ordinary MELM. We highlight SMILE as a novel methodology and robust framework that holds great potential to significantly promote the development of MELM.</description>

Abstract: We designed and built an adjustable repetition rate optical frequency comb using off-the-shelf components with several improvements to an established erbium fiber design. This design, built fully by an undergraduate, was assembled at a fraction of the cost of a commercial comb. This comb has a repetition rate of roughly 100 MHz with a tuning range of 3 MHz. A stabilization control loop for $f_{rep}$ achieved long term drifts of &lt; 1 Hz over several days. This comb will eventually be implemented for use in dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field equation for modeling Fabry-Perot resonators filled with a dispersive medium exhibiting both Brillouin and Kerr nonlinearities, e.g. an optical fiber. This model is derived from a unified framework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It involves two coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb generation in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for investigating subatomic dynamics and can be produced using a free-electron laser (FEL). It has been suggested that an optical FEL, which employs a laser pulse in place of a conventional undulator, could enable a dramatically more compact implementation of such a light source. Yet, the high electron density and subsequent high emittance implied by an optical FEL makes this concept challenging to realize with an electron beam. There has been impressive progress in recent years producing collimated dense and relativistic beams of electrons and positrons in the laboratory. The inherent stability of a quasi-neutral electron-positron beam mitigates Coulomb expansion, and renders it a promising alternative source of coherent light, as we demonstrate here. Specifically, we show via computer simulations that broadband coherent light in the XUV domain, which takes the form of 8-as pulses at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in a laser pulse. This process occurs over a sub-millimeter length scale, enabling the development of orders-of-magnitude more compact light sources that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Bright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, it is equally crucial to combine high brightness with nanoscale size in short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters. However, such nano-emitters are currently lacking. Here, we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with length much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR domain. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in dispersed carbon nanotubes. We further investigate the nonlinear photoluminescence behavior of color centers functionalized carbon nanotubes in response to varying excitation conditions, spanning from ensemble measurements to single-nanotube experiments. We discuss how this behavior influences the determination of their photoluminescence quantum yields, which can reach values as high as 20% for ultrashort ones detected at the single nanotube level. Notably, the corresponding NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After rendering them biocompatible, we demonstrate point-spread function engineering and high-resolution, 3-dimensional single-particle tracking using these bright ultrashort carbon nanotubes allowing nanoscale imaging in the NIR-II window within thick brain tissue.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of Dirac-Landau polaritons via THz magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. We demonstrate efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, characterized by a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model calculations, based on the nonlinear dependence of the emission intensity and spectral narrowing with bias voltage, indicate a polariton occupancy per mode close to unity, with a significant contribution from stimulated polariton emission. These findings open promising prospects for the development of Dirac-Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable terahertz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \(\rho = 0\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \(\rho\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\(m\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \(m\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \(m \neq 0\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.</description>
