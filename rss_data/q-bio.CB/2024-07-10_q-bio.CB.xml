      <title>Engineering morphogenesis of cell clusters with differentiable programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the rules underlying organismal development is a major unsolved problem in biology. Each cell in a developing organism responds to signals in its local environment by dividing, excreting, consuming, or reorganizing, yet how these individual actions coordinate over a macroscopic number of cells to grow complex structures with exquisite functionality is unknown. Here we use recent advances in automatic differentiation to discover local interaction rules and genetic networks that yield emergent, systems-level characteristics in a model of development. We consider a growing tissue with cellular interactions are mediated by morphogen diffusion, differential cell adhesion and mechanical stress. Each cell has an internal genetic network that it uses to make decisions based on its local environment. We show that one can simultaneously learn parameters governing the cell interactions and the genetic network for complex developmental scenarios, including the symmetry breaking of an embryo from an initial cell, the creation of emergent chemical gradients,homogenization of growth via mechanical stress, programmed growth into a prespecified shape, and the ability to repair from damage. When combined with recent experimental advances measuring spatio-temporal dynamics and gene expression of cells in a growing tissue, the methodology outlined here offers a promising path to unravelling the cellular basis of development.</description>

      <title>Active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration coupling actin flow and adhesion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migration of animal cells is based on the interplay between actin polymerization at the front, adhesion along the cell-substrate interface, and actomyosin contractility at the back. Active gel theory has been used before to demonstrate that actomyosin contractility is sufficient for polarization and self-sustained cell migration in the absence of external cues, but did not consider the dynamics of adhesion. Likewise, migration models based on the mechanosensitive dynamics of adhesion receptors usually do not include the global dynamics of intracellular flow. Here we show that both aspects can be combined in a minimal active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration with dynamic adhesion. This model demonstrates that load sharing between the adhesion receptors leads to symmetry breaking, with stronger adhesion at the front, and that bistability of migration arises for intermediate adhesiveness. Local variations in adhesiveness are sufficient to switch between sessile and motile states, in qualitative agreement with experiments.</description>
