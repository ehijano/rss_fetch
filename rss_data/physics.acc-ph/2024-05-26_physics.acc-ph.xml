      <title>More Sample-Efficient Tuning of Particle Accelerators with Bayesian Optimization and Prior Mean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning particle accelerators is a challenging and time-consuming task, but can be automated and carried out efficiently through the use of suitable optimization algorithms. With successful applications at various facilities, Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process modeling has proven to be a particularly powerful tool to address these challenges in practice. One of its major benefits is that it allows incorporating prior information, such as knowledge about the shape of the objective function or predictions based on archived data, simulations or surrogate models, into the model. In this work, we propose the use of a neural network model as an efficient way to include prior knowledge about the objective function into the Bayesian optimization process to speed up convergence. We report results obtained in simulations and experiments using neural network priors to perform optimization of electron and heavy-ion accelerator facilities, specifically the Linac Coherent Light Source and the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System. Finally, we evaluate how the accuracy of the prior mean predictions affect optimization performance.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation-Induced Emittance Growth in a Multi-Bend Deflection Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preserving beam quality during the transportation of high-brightness electron beams is a significant and widespread challenge in the design of modern accelerators. The importance of this issue stems from the fact that the quality of the beam at the accelerator's output is crucial for various applications, including particle colliders, free-electron lasers, and synchrotron radiation sources. The coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) effect can degrade beam quality when a bunch is deflected. Therefore, developing a structure that effectively suppresses the CSR effect, especially for the short bunches is critically important. This involves protecting both the transverse emittance and the longitudinal profile to ensure the production of a high-quality beam. In this study, an optimization based on the reverse lattice of the beamline is proposed. This method can simplify the optimization process. Based on this approach, the Quadruple Bend Achromat (QBA) deflection structure has been designed and optimized. Then we have derived a general solution to completely suppress the impact of steady-state CSR on the transverse plane for different topologies of QBA. Furthermore, a general condition is proposed for suppressing displacements caused by CSR in sequence drifts for isochronous structures. Simultaneously, QBA has proven to be the simplest structure that can simultaneously suppress both types of CSR effects. Simulation results for bunches with a peak current of up to $3000A$ show almost no change in transverse emittance for a large angle deflection.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing classical accelerometers and gyroscopes with a quantum inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>
