      <title>Information and fitness in two-state systems: self-replicating individuals in a fluctuating environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A population of individuals with the same genes can present heterogeneous traits (phenotypes). The prevalence of this heterogeneity can be explained as a bet-hedging strategy that improves the population proliferation rate (fitness) in fluctuating environments. The phenotype distribution is influenced by factors such as competition between phenotypes, the duration of environmental states, and the rate of phenotype-switching. We illustrate these effects in a system where both the environment and the phenotype can adopt two states. This system includes scenarios such as symmetric bet-hedging and dormant-proliferating phenotypes. We examine how environmental and phenotypic states share mutual information, measured in bits, and explore the relationship between this information and population fitness. We propose that when fitness is measured relative to the case where phenotype and environment are independent, information and fitness can be treated as equivalent measures. We investigate strategies that individuals can use to improve this information, such as adjusting the rates of proliferation and phenotype-switching relative to the environmental fluctuation rate. Through these strategies, with fixed marginal distributions, an increase in information implies an increase in population fitness. We also identify limits to the maximum achievable fitness and information and discuss the value of the information in terms of this new normalized fitness. Our framework offers new insights into how organisms adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary learning of microbial populations in partially predictable environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations evolving in fluctuating environments face the fundamental challenge of balancing adaptation to current conditions against preparation for uncertain futures. Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable environments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off between growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We demonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable allocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing faster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal structure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of environmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved allocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our framework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit environmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the proteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns. This work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular resource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding learning-like behavior in evolving biological systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale phylodynamic modelling of rapid punctuated pathogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of models simulating pandemics across three scales: (1) pathogen evolution, often punctuated by the rapid emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating feedback loops between dynamics unfolding at these different scales. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model that incorporates within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling the punctuated evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, which captures a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model replicates the essential features of the COVID-19 pandemic and virus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Climate benefits of afforestation and reforestation with varying species mixtures and densities in the north-western boreal lands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boreal forest plays a crucial role as a global carbon sink. This study uses two 250-year simulations of Canada's Taiga Plains, an area targeted by the 2 Billion Trees Program to evaluate afforestation and reforestation strategies that vary by species mix, planting density, and surface albedo. Medium density stands, 600 to 1400 trees per hectare, composed of mixed species with approximately 25 to 40 percent deciduous trees sequestered 15 to 30 percent more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures. These benefits stem from a combination of rapid early growth, long-term carbon retention, and enhanced resilience to disturbance. Replanting understocked stands with such mixtures increased long-term carbon storage by 18 to 30 percent relative to prevailing scenarios. When surface albedo was considered, pure evergreen or deciduous stands showed a reduction in climate benefit by 6 to 20 percent, while mixed stands maintained net cooling and achieved the highest sequestration rates, approximately 4.6 to 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare per year. Scenarios involving partial harvesting followed by replanting sustained or improved ecosystem carbon stocks, about 300 to 340 tons of carbon per hectare, and productivity, roughly 1.6 to 2.0 tons of carbon per hectare per year, without increasing ecological risk. Overall, integrating fast-growing deciduous species with long-lived conifers at moderate planting densities enhances the climate mitigation potential of boreal afforestation and reforestation efforts and offers guidance for reforestation policy in similar high latitude ecosystems.</description>
