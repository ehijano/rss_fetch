      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system (DS) found in a photonics system. In this DS, robust causality is created, and as a result, it becomes possible to find behavior that can be understood as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). Furthermore, by arranging such DSs as basic elements and building certain relationships between them through optical interference, it becomes possible to create a unique system that causes complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the MBLS and the Ising model, it can be used as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criticality in Scale-Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hereto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>
