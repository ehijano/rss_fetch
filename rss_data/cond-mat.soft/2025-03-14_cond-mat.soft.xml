      <title>Effects of oblique collimated irradiation on the onset of phototaxis-driven bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of oblique collimated irradiation on the onset of phototaxis-driven bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium. A linear stability analysis is conducted to assess the system's stability under fixed parameter values. The resulting eigenvalue problem is numerically solved using a fourth-order accurate finite difference scheme combined with Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich iterations. The results indicate that the system exhibits increased instability as the angle of incidence rises for a given Darcy number. Additionally, the critical Rayleigh number is found to be higher when a rigid top wall is considered compared to a stress-free top wall, suggesting that the suspension attains greater stability in the presence of a rigid top boundary.</description>

      <title>Active Saffman-Taylor Viscous Fingering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding swimming bacteria to a liquid causes its effective shear viscosity to decrease, eventually reaching a regime of zero viscosity. We examined whether this property leads to viscous finger-like displacement fronts like those observed when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous liquid. Our study revealed that this system exhibits more complex dynamic characteristics than the classical Saffman-Taylor instability. We discovered that this instability occurs when the bacterial volume fraction exceeds a critical value, and the imposed shear rate is below critical value, for which the viscosity of the suspension is zero.</description>

      <title>Rouse Mode Analysis of Chain Relaxation in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymer Melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer melts with chains undergoing reversible crosslinking have distinctively favorable dynamic properties, e.g., self healing and reprocessability. In these situations there are two relevant elementary time scales: the segmental and the sticker association times. A convenient framework to model these situations is the sticky Rouse model and here we perform hybrid moleculear dynamics (MD) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to examine its relevance. In agreement with the underpinning idea discussed above we find that reversibly crosslinked chains show two distinct modes of relaxation behavior depending on the magnitude of bond lifetimes. For bond lifetimes shorter than the chain end-to-end relaxation time, the polymers exhibit essentially Rouse like dynamics, but with an apparently increased local friction relative to the non-sticky analog. For longer bond lifetimes, the chains exhibit two modes of relaxation: the faster mode is independent of bond lifetime, but the slower mode is controlled by it. However, these slower mode results are not consistent with the predictions of the sticky Rouse model. Our Rouse mode analysis as a function of chain length, N, imply that this is likely a result of the relatively short chain length employed, but they nevertheless suggest that theories need to include these small chain effects if they are to be relevant to experimental systems with short chains following Rouse dynamics.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and microrheology in complex fluids under periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green-Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).</description>

      <title>Extension of Sequence of Physical Processes framework relating the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor to the Green-Lagrange strain tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of the Sequence of Physical Processes using geometrical corrections of the Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor and the Green-Lagrange strain tensor is addressed. More precisely, the usual Sequence of Physical Processes omits some geometrical non linearities that appear when the deformation becomes large. With this extension, geometrical corrections are added and let the opportunity to study rheological non linearities. Application on two famous classical viscoelastic models, namely the linear Maxwell model and the linear Kelvin-Voigt model, helps to understand how some complex behaviours may be rationalised to better understand the behaviours after some corrections.</description>

      <title>Active learning for parameter-free multiscale modeling of boundary lubrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubricated friction is a multiscale problem where molecular processes dictate the macroscopic response of the system. Traditional lubrication models rely on semi-empirical constitutive relations, which become unreliable under extreme conditions. Here, we present a simulation framework that seamlessly couples molecular and continuum models for boundary lubrication without fixed-form constitutive laws. We train Gaussian process regression models as surrogates for predicting interfacial shear and normal stress in molecular dynamics simulations. An active learning algorithm ensures that our model adapts in scenarios where common constitutive laws fail, such as near phase transitions. We demonstrate our approach for nanoscale fluid flow over rough and heterogeneous surfaces, paving the way for accurate boundary lubrication simulations at experimental length and time scales.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Peridynamics based model of anticrack-type fracture in brittle foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particular failure mode of highly porous brittle materials consists in the propagation of cracks under uniaxial compressive loads. Such 'anticracks' have been observed in a range of materials, from snow and porous sandstone to brittle foams. Here we present a computational model for the formation and propagation of anticrack-type failure in porous materials within the general computational framework of bond-based peridynamics. Random porosity is represented, on a scale well above the characteristic pore size, by random bond deletion (dilution disorder). We apply our framework to experimental data on anticrack propagation in silicate foams.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Memory effect by coupling between translational and rotational Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures exhibits abnormally large displacements. Using falling-ball viscometry applied to colloidal particles, we experimentally verified that no anomaly exists in the viscosity coefficient of the solution. Our findings reveal that the anomalous Brownian motion can be attributed to the memory effect arising from the coupling between rotational and translational motion. It was deduced that the relaxation time of sub-microsecond rotational motion serves as a memory effect, influencing translational motion and leading to anomalously large Brownian displacements over a timescale of seconds. This study demonstrates that short-time memory effects can be effectively investigated through long-duration measurements.</description>

      <title>A Fluctuation Theory of Transport Properties in Liquid-Phase Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of comprehensively describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium continues to be a main concern in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, particularly in the context of calculating the transport properties of liquid-phase systems. This paper presents a step towards a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory tailored for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. This field-theoretical framework, grounded in the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, integrates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations consistent with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This approach, which is a phenomenological extension of the well-known Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, allows for the computation of practically important transport properties such as mobility and shear viscosity. We apply our approach to the calculation of the corresponding quantities for solutions with a single solute. We derive general formulas for the mobility of solute molecules and the shear viscosity of a single-solute solution. Based on these findings, we present new results and reproduce previously established results for systems such as the Gaussian-core model, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</description>

Abstract: This article is a comment of N. Chapuis and L. Bocquet, Sustainable Energy Fuels, 2025, DOI: 10.1039/D4SE01366B which title is "Boosting large scale capacitive harvesting of osmotic power by dynamical matching of ion exchange kinetics". In this work, the authors present an experimental process that shows how it is possible to set up a reverse electrodialysis cell capable of achieving power values of 5 W/m2. This value is the profitability threshold. Our work challenges this claim and questions whether the proposed technique can be scaled up, as well as the modeling of the process.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification of thermal grease rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheologically complex soft solids such as thermal greases consist of filler particles within a polymer matrix. These materials find applications in improving the conformity of solid-solid contacts and enhancing heat transfer. Complex soft solids exhibit a transient non-Newtonian rheological response, including thixotropy and viscoelasticity. Previously, stress relaxation and buildup in sheared commercial thermal greases were successfully captured using a nonlinear elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) model and a thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP). However, the previous model calibration methods ignored parameter uncertainty, providing only single values of the rheological parameters, and did not quantitatively address the chosen model's identifiability from the data or credibility of the calibration. We address these limitations via hierarchical Bayesian inference, accounting for uncertainties arising from epistemic and aleatoric sources. Importantly, the hierarchical approach allows us to assimilate experiments measuring the stress responses at various startup shear rates by allowing the models' parameters to vary across different shear rates. Then, a global distribution and the associated uncertainty are obtained by pooling. We also propagate uncertainties to the transient shear stress response predicted by the models. Overall, we demonstrate that the chosen NEVP and NEVP models are identifiable from rheometric startup data. However, for the TEVP model, the uncertainty of the parameters is lower (narrower distributions) when higher shear rates are used for inference.</description>

      <title>Flow birefringence of shear-thinning fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</description>

      <title>The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework for Multiphase Fluid Flows: Laminar, Turbulent, and Active</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and fractional Shapiro steps in collective dynamics of microparticles</title>

Abstract: In driven nonlinear systems, phase locking is an intriguing effect leading to robust stationary states that are stable over extended ranges of control parameters. Recent experiments allow for exploring microscopic mechanisms underlying such phenomena in collective dynamics of micro- and nanoparticles. Here we show that phase-locked dynamics of hardcore-interacting microparticles in a densely populated periodic potential under time-periodic driving arises from running solitary cluster waves. We explain how values of phase-locked currents are related to soliton velocities and why collective particle dynamics synchronize with the driving for certain particle diameters only. Our analysis is based on an effective potential for the solitary wave propagation and a unit displacement law, saying that the total average shift of all particle positions per soliton period equals one wavelength of the periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation (AR) in a double-well potential. We explore the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering behaviors in an asymmetric potential trap. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain a phase diagram that illustrates flocking behavior as a function of active reorientation and potential asymmetry. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling exponent, we identify distinct diffusion regimes. Our findings demonstrate that active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Universality in diffusion-controlled nucleation and growth</title>

Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.</description>

      <title>Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.</description>
