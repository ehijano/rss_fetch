      <title>From Mutation to Degradation: Predicting Nonsense-Mediated Decay with NMDEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes. However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as existing models often rely on simplistic rule-based heuristics or limited feature sets, constraining their accuracy and generalizability. Using paired DNA and RNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we benchmark embedding-only models and demonstrate that they underperform compared to a simple rule-based approach. To address this, we develop NMDEP (NMD Efficiency Predictor), an integrative framework that combines optimized rule-based methods, sequence embeddings, and curated biological features, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. Through explainable AI, we identify key NMD determinants, reaffirming established factors such as variant position while uncovering novel contributors like ribosome loading. Applied to over 2.9 million simulated stop-gain variants, NMDEP facilitates large-scale mRNA degradation assessments, advancing variant interpretation and disease research.</description>

      <title>ToSkA: Topological Skeleton Analysis for Network-Based Shape Representation and Evaluation of Objects from Cells to Death Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape analysis and classification are popular methods for biologists, biophysicists and mathematicians investigating relationships between object function and form. Classic shape descriptors, such as sphericity, can be powerful but may be insufficient for more complex shapes. Here, we present 'napari-toska' a topological skeleton based method to analyze complex objects by representing their shape asymmetries as networks. Using global neighborhood principles, classic network science metrics and spatial feature embedding we create instance segmentation object profiles to be used for immediate or downstream classification. napari-toska can also follow temporal dynamics and identify network features capable of differentiating between experimental phenotypes. We incorporated the capacity to measure absolute spatial features of objects to bring in aspects of scale. Furthermore, napari-toska identifies certain segmentation errors through the emergence or loss of network cycles. Combined, napari-toska functions allow for flexible and in-depth shape profiling of intricate shapes often observed in biological and physical settings where robust, yet precise, system configuration is essential to downstream processes.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Tensor Decomposition in Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition has emerged as a powerful framework for feature extraction in multi-modal biomedical data. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of tensor decomposition methods such as Tucker, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC, spiked tensor decomposition, etc. and their diverse applications across biomedical domains such as imaging, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics. To systematically investigate the literature, we applied a topic modeling-based approach that identifies and groups distinct thematic sub-areas in biomedicine where tensor decomposition has been used, thereby revealing key trends and research directions. We evaluated challenges related to the scalability of latent spaces along with obtaining the optimal rank of the tensor, which often hinder the extraction of meaningful features from increasingly large and complex datasets. Additionally, we discuss recent advances in quantum algorithms for tensor decomposition, exploring how quantum computing can be leveraged to address these challenges. Our study includes a preliminary resource estimation analysis for quantum computing platforms and examines the feasibility of implementing quantum-enhanced tensor decomposition methods on near-term quantum devices. Collectively, this review not only synthesizes current applications and challenges of tensor decomposition in biomedical analyses but also outlines promising quantum computing strategies to enhance its impact on deriving actionable insights from complex biomedical data.</description>
