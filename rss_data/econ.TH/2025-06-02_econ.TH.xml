      <title>A note on the diversity Owen values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B\'eal et al. (Int J Game Theory 54, 2025) introduce the Diversity Owen value for TU-games with diversity constraints, and provide axiomatic characterizations using the axioms of fairness and balanced contributions. However, there exist logical flaws in the proofs of the uniqueness of these characterizations. In this note we provides the corrected proofs of the characterizations by introducing the null player for diversity games axiom. Also, we establish two alternative characterizations of the Diversity Owen value by modified or weakening the axioms of the above characterizations.</description>

      <title>Note on the size of a stable matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a one-to-one two-sided matching market with workers on one side and single-position firms on the other, and suppose that the largest individually rational matching contains $n$ pairs. We show that the number of workers employed and positions filled in every stable matching is bounded from below by $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ and we characterise the class of preferences that attain the bound.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Restaking vs. Proof-of-Stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the efficiency of restaking and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols in terms of stake requirements. First, we consider the sufficient condition for the restaking graph to be secure. We show that the condition implies that it is always possible to transform such a restaking graph into secure PoS protocols. Next, we derive two main results, giving upper and lower bounds on required extra stakes that one needs to add to validators of the secure restaking graph to be able to transform it into secure PoS protocols. In particular, we show that the restaking savings compared to PoS protocols can be very large and can asymptotically grow in the worst case as a square root of the number of validators. We also study a complementary question of transforming secure PoS protocols into an aggregate secure restaking graph and provide lower and upper bounds on the PoS savings compared to restaking.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design for Dynamic Stochastic Environments: Myerson Meets Naor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allocation of goods and services often involves both stochastic supply and stochastic demand. Motivated by applications such as cloud computing, gig platforms, and blockchain auctions, we study the design of optimal selling mechanisms in an environment where buyers with private valuations arrive stochastically and are assigned goods that also arrive stochastically, and either buyers or goods can be held in a queue at costs until allocation. The optimal mechanism dynamically leverages competitive pressure across time by managing the queue of buyers and inventory of goods, using reserve prices that increase with the number of buyers in the queue and decrease with the number of items in inventory, and an auction to allocate the goods.</description>
