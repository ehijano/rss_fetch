      <title>A Sustainable and Reward Incentivized High-Performance Cluster Computing for Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Bayesian-Time-Decay Trust Mechanism in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an age where sustainability is of paramount importance, the significance of both high-performance computing and intelligent algorithms cannot be understated. Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.</description>

      <title>Equivalence and Separation between Heard-Of and Asynchronous Message-Passing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between two fundamental models of distributed computation: the asynchronous message-passing model with up to $f$ crash failures ($\operatorname{AMP}_f$) and the Heard-Of model with up to $f$ message omissions ($\operatorname{HO}_f$). We show that for $n &gt; 2f$, the two models are equivalent with respect to the solvability of colorless tasks, and that for colored tasks the equivalence holds only when $f = 1$ (and $n &gt; 2$). The separation for larger $f$ arises from the presence of silenced processes in $\operatorname{HO}_f$, which may lead to incompatible decisions. The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing. The results extend to randomized protocols against a non-adaptive adversary, indicating that the expressive limits of canonical rounds are structural rather than probabilistic. Together, these results delineate precisely where round-based abstractions capture asynchronous computation, and where they do not.</description>

      <title>OOCO: Latency-disaggregated Architecture for Online-Offline Co-locate LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both latency-sensitive online services and cost-sensitive offline workloads. Co-locating these workloads on shared serving instances can improve resource utilization, but directly applying this approach to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregated systems introduces severe load imbalance, as fluctuating request mixes alter the intrinsic P/D ratio. Existing dynamic adjustment techniques cannot keep up with the bursty traffic patterns of online services.
  We propose a latency-constraint disaggregated architecture, which separates cluster resources into latency-strict and latency-relaxed pools based on task latency requirements. This design enables flexible placement of offline decode tasks, mitigating P/D imbalance while preserving online performance. To fully exploit this flexibility, we propose (1) a bottleneck-based scheduler guided by a Roofline-based performance model for performance bottleneck based scheduling, and (2) a fast preemption mechanism that strictly enforces Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for online requests.
  Experiments on real-world traces show that compared to existing offline system approaches, our method improves offline throughput by up to 3x, while maintaining online request SLOs.</description>

      <title>Clock2Q+: A Simple and Efficient Replacement Algorithm for Metadata Cache in VMware vSAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.</description>

      <title>ZipperChain: Transmuting Trusted Third-Party Services Into Trustless Atomic Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) rely on distributed consensus mechanisms to reach agreement over the order of transactions and to provide immutability and availability of transaction data. Distributed consensus suffers from performance limitations of network communication between participating nodes. BLOCKY ZipperChain guarantees immutability, agreement, and availability of transaction data, but without relying on distributed consensus. Instead, its construction process transfers trust from widely-used, third-party services onto ZipperChains's correctness guarantees. ZipperChain blocks are built by a pipeline of specialized services deployed on a small number of nodes connected by a fast data center network. As a result, ZipperChain transaction throughput approaches network line speeds and block finality is on the order of 500 ms. Finally, ZipperChain infrastructure creates blocks centrally and so does not need a native token to incentivize a community of verifiers.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Cross-Language Interoperability in Replicated Data Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Modern distributed systems replicate data across multiple execution sites. Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.
  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.
  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.
  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.
  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.</description>

      <title>PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.
  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Simultaneous Consensus with Limited Information Exchange (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work on the development of optimal fault-tolerant Agreement protocols using the logic of knowledge has concentrated on the "full information" approach to information exchange, which is costly with respect to message size. Alpturer, Halpern, and van der Meyden (PODC 2023) introduced the notion of optimality with respect to a limited information exchange, and studied the Eventual Agreement problem in the sending omissions failure model. The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Casta\~neda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002). A new information exchange is also introduced that enables decisions to be made at worst one round later than the optimal protocol of Dwork and Moses (I&amp;C 88), but with lower computation cost and space requirements. By determining implementations of a knowledge based program, protocols are derived that are optimal amongst protocols for each of these information exchanges.</description>

      <title>OmniInfer: System-Wide Acceleration Techniques for Optimizing LLM Serving Throughput and Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models drive a wide range of modern AI applications but impose substantial challenges on large-scale serving systems due to intensive computation, strict latency constraints, and throughput bottlenecks. We introduce OmniInfer, a unified system-level acceleration framework designed to maximize end-to-end serving efficiency through fine-grained optimization of expert placement, cache compression, and scheduling. OmniInfer integrates three complementary components: OmniPlacement for load-aware Mixture-of-Experts scheduling, OmniAttn for sparse attention acceleration, and OmniProxy for disaggregation-aware request scheduling. Built atop vLLM, OmniInfer delivers system-wide performance gains through adaptive resource disaggregation, efficient sparsity exploitation, and global coordination across prefill and decode phases. Evaluated on DeepSeek-R1 within a 10-node Ascend 910C cluster, OmniInfer achieves 616 QPM, where the unified framework reduces TPOT by 36\%, and the superimposition of OmniProxy further slashes TTFT by 38\%. The project is open-sourced at [this https URL](https://gitee.com/omniai/omniinfer).</description>

      <title>DisCEdge: Distributed Context Management for Large Language Models at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Large Language Model (LLM) services at the edge benefits latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications. However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.
  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency.</description>

      <title>Accelerating mesh-based Monte Carlo simulations using contemporary graphics ray-tracing hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are the gold-standard for modeling light-tissue interactions due to their accuracy. Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.
  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.
  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.
  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.
  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>Serving Heterogeneous LoRA Adapters in Distributed LLM Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), enabling rapid adaptation to diverse domains. In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>Areon: Latency-Friendly and Resilient Multi-Proposer Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Areon, a family of latency-friendly, stake-weighted, multi-proposer proof-of-stake consensus protocols. By allowing multiple proposers per slot and organizing blocks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Areon achieves robustness under partial synchrony. Blocks reference each other within a sliding window, forming maximal antichains that represent parallel ``votes'' on history. Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.
  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.
  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates. Across a wide range of adversarial stakes and network delays, Areon-Base achieves bounded-latency finality with consistently lower reorganization frequency and depth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) offloads main computing tasks from multiple resource-constrained user equippments (UEs) to the base station (BS), while preserving local data privacy. However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that C$^2$P$^2$SL significantly reduces system training time by over 38\% while maintaining convergence accuracy under different communication conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond 2-Edge-Connectivity: Algorithms and Impossibility for Content-Oblivious Leader Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The content-oblivious model, introduced by Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel (PODC 2022; Distributed Computing 2023), captures an extremely weak form of communication where nodes can only send asynchronous, content-less pulses. Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$. This seemingly ruled out many natural graph problems on non-2-edge-connected graphs.
  In this work, we show that, with the knowledge of network topology $G$, leader election is possible in a wide range of graphs.
  Impossibility: Graphs symmetric about an edge admit no randomized terminating leader election algorithm, even when nodes have unique identifiers and full knowledge of $G$.
  Leader election algorithms: Trees that are not symmetric about any edge admit a quiescently terminating leader election algorithm with topology knowledge, even in anonymous networks, using $O(n^2)$ messages, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Moreover, even-diameter trees admit a terminating leader election given only the knowledge of the network diameter $D = 2r$, with message complexity $O(nr)$.
  Necessity of topology knowledge: In the family of graphs $\mathcal{G} = \{P_3, P_5\}$, both the 3-path $P_3$ and the 5-path $P_5$ admit a quiescently terminating leader election if nodes know the topology exactly. However, if nodes only know that the underlying topology belongs to $\mathcal{G}$, then terminating leader election is impossible.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Flat Federated Learning Method via Weighted Momentum and Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), models must \emph{converge quickly} under tight communication budgets while \emph{generalizing} across non-IID client distributions. These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $\sigma_\rho^2=\sigma^2+(L\rho)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

      <title>Silence Speaks Volumes: A New Paradigm for Covert Communication via History Timing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Covert Channel (CC) exploits legitimate communication mechanisms to stealthily transmit information, often bypassing traditional security controls. Among these, a novel paradigm called History Covert Channels (HCC) leverages past network events as reference points to embed covert messages. Unlike traditional timing- or storage-based CCs, which directly manipulate traffic patterns or packet contents, HCCs minimize detectability by encoding information through small pointers to historical data. This approach enables them to amplify the size of transmitted covert data by referring to more bits than are actually embedded. Recent research has explored the feasibility of such methods, demonstrating their potential to evade detection by repurposing naturally occurring network behaviors as a covert transmission medium.
  This paper introduces a novel method for establishing and maintaining covert communication links using relative pointers to network timing patterns, which minimizes the reliance of the HCC on centralized timekeeping and reduces the likelihood of being detected by standard network monitoring tools. We also explore the tailoring of HCCs to optimize their robustness and undetectability characteristics. Our experiments reveal a better bitrate compared to previous work.</description>

      <title>When AI Bends Metal: AI-Assisted Optimization of Design Parameters in Sheet Metal Forming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Survey: A Multi-Level Taxonomy of Aggregation Techniques, Experimental Insights, and Future Frontiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of IoT and AI has unlocked innovation across industries, but growing privacy concerns and data isolation hinder progress. Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of finding the shortest path between two selected vertices of a graph and formulate this as an $\ell_1$-regularized regression -- Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso). We draw connections between a numerical implementation of this lasso-formulation, using the so-called LARS algorithm, and a more established algorithm known as the bi-directional Dijkstra. Appealing features of our formulation include the applicability of the Alternating Direction of Multiplier Method (ADMM) to the problem to identify short paths, and a relatively efficient update to topological changes.</description>

      <title>RetryGuard: Preventing Self-Inflicted Retry Storms in Cloud Microservices Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cloud applications are built on independent, diverse microservices, offering scalability, flexibility, and usage-based billing. However, the structural design of these varied services, along with their reliance on auto-scalers for dynamic internet traffic, introduces significant coordination challenges. As we demonstrate in this paper, common default retry patterns used between misaligned services can turn into retry storms which drive up resource usage and costs, leading to self-inflicted Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) scenarios. To overcome these problems we introduce RetryGuard, a distributed framework for productive control of retry patterns across interdependent microservices. By managing retry policy on a per-service basis and making parallel decisions, RetryGuard prevents retry storms, curbs resource contention, and mitigates escalating operational costs. RetryGuard makes its decisions based on an analytic model that captures the relationships among retries, throughput (rejections), delays, and costs. Experimental results show that RetryGuard significantly reduces resource usage and costs compared to AWS standard and advanced retry policies. We further demonstrate its scalability and superior performance in a more complex Kubernetes deployment with the Istio service mesh, where it achieves substantial improvements.</description>

      <title>Closing the Generalization Gap in Parameter-efficient Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Execution of Bayesian Neural Networks using a Single Probabilistic Forward Pass and Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous Learning for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing FL-based approaches are based on the unrealistic assumption that the data on the client-side is fully annotated with ground truths. Furthermore, it is a great challenge how to improve the training efficiency while ensuring the detection accuracy in the highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoT networks. Meanwhile, the communication cost between clients and the server is also a problem that can not be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous (FedS3A) learning for anomaly detection in IoT networks. First, we consider a more realistic assumption that labeled data is only available at the server, and pseudo-labeling is utilized to implement federated semi-supervised learning, in which a dynamic weight of supervised learning is exploited to balance the supervised learning at the server and unsupervised learning at clients. Then, we propose a semi-asynchronous model update and staleness tolerant distribution scheme to achieve a trade-off between the round efficiency and detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the staleness of local models and the participation frequency of clients are considered to adjust their contributions to the global model. In addition, a group-based aggregation function is proposed to deal with the non-IID distribution of the data. Finally, the difference transmission based on the sparse matrix is adopted to reduce the communication cost. Extensive experimental results show that FedS3A can achieve greater than 98% accuracy even when the data is non-IID and is superior to the classic FL-based algorithms in terms of both detection performance and round efficiency, achieving a win-win situation. Meanwhile, FedS3A successfully reduces the communication cost by higher than 50%.</description>

      <title>DistTrain: Addressing Model and Data Heterogeneity with Disaggregated Training for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) empower LLMs to ingest inputs and generate outputs in multiple forms, such as text, image, and audio. However, the integration of multiple modalities introduces heterogeneity in both the model and training data, creating unique systems challenges.
  We propose DistTrain, a disaggregated training system for multimodal LLMs. DistTrain incorporates two novel disaggregation techniques to address model and data heterogeneity, respectively. The first is disaggregated model orchestration, which separates the training for modality encoder, LLM backbone, and modality generator. This allows the three components to adaptively and independently orchestrate their resources and parallelism configurations. The second is disaggregated data preprocessing, which decouples data preprocessing from training. This eliminates resource contention between preprocessing and training, and enables efficient data reordering to mitigate stragglers within and between microbatches caused by data heterogeneity. We evaluate DistTrain across different sizes of multimodal LLMs on a large-scale production cluster. The experimental results show that DistTrain achieves 54.7% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 72B multimodal LLM on 1172 GPUs and outperforms Megatron-LM by up to 2.2x on training throughput.</description>

      <title>Staleness-Centric Optimizations for Parallel Diffusion MoE Inference</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts-based (MoE-based) diffusion models demonstrate remarkable scalability in high-fidelity image generation, yet their reliance on expert parallelism introduces critical communication bottlenecks. State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

      <title>JANUS: Resilient and Adaptive Data Transmission for Enabling Timely and Efficient Cross-Facility Scientific Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern science, the growing complexity of large-scale scientific projects has led to an increasing reliance on cross-facility scientific workflows, where resources and expertise from multiple institutions and geographic locations are leveraged to accelerate scientific discovery. These workflows often require transmitting huge amounts of scientific data through wide-area networks. Although high-speed networks like ESnet and transfer services such as Globus have improved data mobility, several challenges remain. The sheer volume of data can overwhelm network bandwidth, widely used transport protocols such as TCP suffer from inefficiencies due to retransmissions triggered by packet loss, and existing fault-tolerance mechanisms like erasure coding introduce substantial overhead.
  In this paper, we propose JANUS, a resilient and adaptable data transmission approach designed for cross-facility scientific workflows. Unlike traditional TCP-based methods, JANUSleverages UDP, integrates erasure coding for fault tolerance, and combines it with error-bounded lossy compression to reduce overhead. This novel design allows users to balance data transmission time and accuracy, optimizing transfer performance based on specific scientific requirements. Additionally, JANUS dynamically adjusts erasure coding parameters in response to real-time network conditions, ensuring efficient data transfers even in fluctuating environments. We develop optimization models for determining ideal configurations and implement adaptive data transfer protocols to enhance reliability. Through extensive simulations and real-network experiments, we demonstrate that JANUS significantly improves transfer efficiency while maintaining data fidelity.</description>

      <title>FedAPTA: Federated Multi-task Learning in Computing Power Networks with Adaptive Layer-wise Pruning and Task-aware Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has shown considerable promise in Computing Power Networks (CPNs) for privacy protection, efficient data utilization, and dynamic collaboration. Although it offers practical benefits, applying FL in CPNs continues to encounter a major obstacle, i.e., multi-task deployment. However, existing work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication overhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource wastage issue of heterogeneous devices across multiple tasks in FL under CPNs. To tackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework in CPNs. FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed layer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while considering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally heterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous model recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables the aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared global model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We deploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL methods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhenzovo/FedCPN.</description>

      <title>Pier: Efficient Large Language Model pretraining with Relaxed Global Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global communication, such as all-reduce and allgather, is the prominent performance bottleneck in large language model (LLM) pretraining. To address this issue, we present Pier, an efficient and scalable optimizer with relaxed global communication. Pier is built upon DiLoCo, which leverages an inner optimizer within groups of processors and an outer optimizer that requires global communication. To preserve the convergence and model performance, Pier incorporates two key techniques for the outer optimizer: momentum warmup and momentum decay. Pier employs an efficient and scalable system architecture to enable complex parallelization strategies in LLM pretraining. We examine the model performance and runtime reduction of Pier using the GPT model family (e.g., small, medium, XL, and 7B) and the OpenWebText dataset with a suite of thirteen downstream tasks. With data parallel strategy, Pier speeds up GPT-2 XL training by up to 2.7x-3.7x on 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1.2x-1.9x on 64 GH200 Superchips, respectively, without degradation of validation loss or downstream task performance. With data parallel and tensor parallel, Pier reduces the time cost GPT-2 7B model training by 54.5% on 128 A100s.</description>

      <title>Beluga: A CXL-Based Memory Architecture for Scalable and Efficient LLM KVCache Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallel Implementation of the Pilot Assignment Problem in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assignment of the pilot sequence is a critical challenge in massive MIMO systems, as sharing the same pilot sequence among multiple users causes interference, which degrades the accuracy of the channel estimation. This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)</description>

      <title>DOPO: A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</description>

      <title>Fast multiplication by two's complement addition of numbers represented as a set of polynomial radix 2 indexes, stored as an integer list for massively parallel computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a multiplication method based on numbers represented as set of polynomial radix 2 indices stored as an integer list. The 'polynomial integer index multiplication' method is a set of algorithms implemented in python code. We demonstrate the method to be faster than both the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Karatsuba for multiplication within a certain bit range. Also implemented in python code for comparison purposes with the polynomial radix 2 integer method. We demonstrate that it is possible to express any integer or real number as a list of integer indices, representing a finite series in base two. The finite series of integer index representation of a number can then be stored and distributed across multiple CPUs / GPUs. We show that operations of addition and multiplication can be applied as two's complement additions operating on the index integer representations and can be fully distributed across a given CPU / GPU architecture. We demonstrate fully distributed arithmetic operations such that the 'polynomial integer index multiplication' method overcomes the current limitation of parallel multiplication methods. Ie, the need to share common core memory and common disk for the calculation of results and intermediate results.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data. As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal. Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.</description>

      <title>Programming tools for Analogue Quantum Computing in the High-Performance Computing Context -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way:
  Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities.
  Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration.
  Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</description>

      <title>FedCanon: Non-Convex Composite Federated Learning with Efficient Proximal Operation on Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite federated learning offers a general framework for solving machine learning problems with additional regularization terms. However, existing methods often face significant limitations: many require clients to perform computationally expensive proximal operations, and their performance is frequently vulnerable to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel composite federated learning algorithm called \textbf{FedCanon}, designed to solve the optimization problems comprising a possibly non-convex loss function and a weakly convex, potentially non-smooth regularization term. By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. Concurrently, it integrates control variables into local updates to mitigate the client drift arising from data heterogeneity. The entire architecture avoids the complex subproblems of primal-dual alternatives. The theoretical analysis provides the first rigorous convergence guarantees for this proximal-skipping framework in the general non-convex setting. It establishes that FedCanon achieves a sublinear convergence rate, and a linear rate under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, without the restrictive bounded heterogeneity assumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedCanon outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>A Fast Relax-and-Round Approach to Unit Commitment for Data Center Own Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to "bring own generation" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with no accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.</description>

      <title>Readout-Side Bypass for Residual Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.</description>
