      <title>IntelliCardiac: An Intelligent Platform for Cardiac Image Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03838v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>From Spaceborn to Airborn: SAR Image Synthesis Using Foundation Models for Multi-Scale Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning approach for Depressive Symptoms assessment in Parkinson's disease patients using facial videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).</description>

      <title>Prototype-Based Information Compensation Network for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-source remote sensing data joint classification aims to provide accuracy and reliability of land cover classification by leveraging the complementary information from multiple data sources. Existing methods confront two challenges: inter-frequency multi-source feature coupling and inconsistency of complementary information exploration. To solve these issues, we present a Prototype-based Information Compensation Network (PICNet) for land cover classification based on HSI and SAR/LiDAR data. Specifically, we first design a frequency interaction module to enhance the inter-frequency coupling in multi-source feature extraction. The multi-source features are first decoupled into high- and low-frequency components. Then, these features are recoupled to achieve efficient inter-frequency communication. Afterward, we design a prototype-based information compensation module to model the global multi-source complementary information. Two sets of learnable modality prototypes are introduced to represent the global modality information of multi-source data. Subsequently, cross-modal feature integration and alignment are achieved through cross-attention computation between the modality-specific prototype vectors and the raw feature representations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our PICNet over state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/oucailab/PICNet.</description>

      <title>3D Brain MRI Classification for Alzheimer Diagnosis Using CNN with Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology Sensing on Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04172v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.</description>

      <title>Enhanced SCanNet with CBAM and Dice Loss for Semantic Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) in remote sensing imagery requires accurately identifying land-cover changes across multi-temporal image pairs. Despite substantial advancements, including the introduction of transformer-based architectures, current SCD models continue to struggle with challenges such as noisy inputs, subtle class boundaries, and significant class imbalance. In this study, we propose enhancing the Semantic Change Network (SCanNet) by integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and employing Dice loss during training. CBAM sequentially applies channel attention to highlight feature maps with the most meaningful content, followed by spatial attention to pinpoint critical regions within these maps. This sequential approach ensures precise suppression of irrelevant features and spatial noise, resulting in more accurate and robust detection performance compared to attention mechanisms that apply both processes simultaneously or independently. Dice loss, designed explicitly for handling class imbalance, further boosts sensitivity to minority change classes. Quantitative experiments conducted on the SECOND dataset demonstrate consistent improvements. Qualitative analysis confirms these improvements, showing clearer segmentation boundaries and more accurate recovery of small-change regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of attention mechanisms and Dice loss in improving feature representation and addressing class imbalance in semantic change detection tasks.</description>

      <title>HYAMD High-Resolution Fundus Image Dataset for age related macular degeneration (AMD) Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hillel Yaffe Age Related Macular Degeneration (HYAMD) dataset is a longitudinal collection of 1,560 Digital Fundus Images (DFIs) from 325 patients examined at the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center (Hadera, Israel) between 2021 and 2024. The dataset includes an AMD cohort of 147 patients (aged 54-94) with varying stages of AMD and a control group of 190 diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients (aged 24-92). AMD diagnoses were based on comprehensive clinical ophthalmic evaluations, supported by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. Non-AMD DFIs were sourced from DR patients without concurrent AMD, diagnosed using macular OCT, fluorescein angiography, and widefield imaging. HYAMD provides gold-standard annotations, ensuring AMD labels were assigned following a full clinical assessment. Images were captured with a DRI OCT Triton (Topcon) camera, offering a 45 deg field of view and 1960 x 1934 pixel resolution. To the best of our knowledge, HYAMD is the first open-access retinal dataset from an Israeli sample, designed to support AMD identification using machine learning models.</description>

      <title>mAIstro: an open-source multi-agentic system for automated end-to-end development of radiomics and deep learning models for medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating complex workflows in healthcare AI. We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration.

      <title>Device-Free Localization Using Multi-Link MIMO Channels in Distributed Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presented a novel device-free localization (DFL) framework based on distributed antenna networks (DANs), targeting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future 6G radio access networks (RANs). In the proposed approach, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) leverages the spatial and temporal diversity of multi-link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in DANs to improve localization accuracy. Furthermore, a prototype system was developed using software-defined radios (SDRs) operating in the sub-6 GHz band, and comprehensive evaluations were conducted under indoor conditions involving varying node densities and target types. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves sub-meter localization accuracy in most scenarios and maintains robust performance under complex multipath environments. In addition, the use of Bayesian optimization to fine-tune key parameters, such as sparsity and path thickness, led to significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and target estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DAN-based DFL systems for accurate, robust, and scalable localization.</description>

      <title>Detecting Concept Drift in Neural Networks Using Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of deep learning models has grown beyond human capacity for verification, meta-algorithms are needed to ensure reliable model inference. Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs. Our approach enhances safety by ensuring models are continually evaluated for reliability across varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Securing Immersive 360 Video Streams through Attribute-Based Selective Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delivering high-quality, secure 360{\deg} video content introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of immersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face limitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these high-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective encryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\deg} video streaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying levels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.
  Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting more frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of view. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing areas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and evaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its performance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on intermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual quality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Simultaneous Usage of Edge GPU Hardware Engines for Video Face Detection and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video face detection and recognition in public places at the edge is required in several applications, such as security reinforcement and contactless access to authorized venues. This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of hardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency and pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also includes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring applications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet network. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks are usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and automated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In addition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or within raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding stage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using all the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher throughput, and a slight saving of power consumption of around 300 mW, accounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time performance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several video streams simultaneously. Further performance improvement could have been obtained if the number of shuffle layers that were created by the tensor RT framework for the face recognition task was lower. Thus, the paper suggests some hardware improvements to the existing edge GPU processors to enhance their performance even higher.</description>

      <title>Edge-GPU Based Face Tracking for Face Detection and Recognition Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Aggregation Weights for Federated Segmentation of Pancreas MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing sensitive data, making it an attractive solution for medical imaging tasks. However, traditional FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), face difficulties in generalizing across domains due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics across institutions. This challenge is particularly evident in pancreas MRI segmentation, where anatomical variability and imaging artifacts significantly impact performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FL algorithms for pancreas MRI segmentation and introduce a novel approach that incorporates adaptive aggregation weights. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities. Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple hospitals (centers).</description>

      <title>Proxy Prompt: Endowing SAM and SAM 2 with Auto-Interactive-Prompt for Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation -- Metastases (BraTS-METS) 2025 Lighthouse Challenge: Brain Metastasis Segmentation on Pre- and Post-treatment MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice. Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI images obtained from patients with brain metastases.</description>

      <title>Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</description>
