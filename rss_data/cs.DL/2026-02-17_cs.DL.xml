      <title>FMMD: A multimodal open peer review dataset based on F1000Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) has entered the coexistence phase with traditional peer review, where artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly incorporated into real-world manuscript evaluation. In parallel, research on automated and AI-assisted peer review has proliferated. Despite this momentum, empirical progress remains constrained by several critical limitations in existing datasets. While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric. This bias is reinforced by a narrow focus on data from computer science venues. Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research.</description>

      <title>Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications using controlled vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications is essential in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness and are widely used in combination with Salton's cosine similarity. The latter is problematic because it only considers exact matches between terms. This article introduces two alternative methods - soft cosine and maximum term similarities - that account for the semantic similarity between non-matching terms. The article compares the accuracy of all three methods using the assignment of publications to topics in the TREC 2006 Genomics Track and the assumption that accurate relatedness measures should assign high relatedness scores to publication pairs within the same topic and low scores to pairs from separate topics. Results show that soft cosine is the most accurate method, while the most widely used version of Salton's cosine is markedly less accurate than the other methods tested. These findings have implications for how controlled vocabularies should be used to measure relatedness.</description>

      <title>M-CODE: Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in materials science requires data standards and data management practices that can capture the complexity of real-world structures, including surfaces, interfaces, defects, and dimensionality reduction. We present M-CODE - Materials Categorization via Ontology, Dimensionality and Evolution - a compact categorization system that links materials-science-specific terminology to a set of reusable concepts as building blocks and provenance-aware transformations. M-CODE classifies structures by dimensionality, structural complexity (from pristine to compound pristine, defective, and processed), and variants that capture common structure creation and evolution approaches. A practical implementation of the categorization is provided in an open-source codebase that includes JSON schemas, examples, and Python and TypeScript types/interfaces, designed to support reproducible dataset generation, validation, and community contributions.</description>
