      <title>Tunable magnon emission from a nano-optomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for dense, energy-efficient, and high-frequency signal processing continues to drive device miniaturization. While downscaling remains a central challenge, magnons offer a promising solution as nanoscale signal carriers, supporting broadband operation from GHz to THz without moving charge carriers and generating Joule heating. However, their integration at the nanoscale is limited by conventional electrical excitation based on coplanar waveguides, which require metal pads few to hundreds of micrometres in size. Here, we demonstrate tunable magnon emission into a yttrium iron garnet film by focusing microwave-modulated laser light onto an integrated Au nanodisc. Using inelastic light scattering spectroscopy, we observe magnons whose frequencies match the optical modulation frequencies in the GHz frequency regime. The largest magnon amplitudes are found for circularly polarized laser light and specific nanodisc diameters consistent with a plasmon-enhanced inverse Faraday effect. These results establish plasmonic nanoantennas as reconfigurable nanoscale magnon sources, enabling broadband signal generation governed entirely by optical modulation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization and IPA-Induced Dispersion Tuning in Solid-Core Photonic Crystal Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical investigation of solid-core photonic crystal fibers with circular and hexagonal cladding geometries. The goal is to optimize optical parameters for nonlinear photonics and environmental sensing. Full-vectorial simulations using FDTD, PWE, and FDE are used to analyze the effects of core diameter, pitch, and air filling fraction on the zero-dispersion wavelength, nonlinear coefficient, effective mode area, and confinement loss. Reducing the core diameter from 2.4 to 1.4 microns tunes the zero-dispersion wavelength from 791 to 646 nanometers and increases the nonlinear coefficient by 72 percent, from 72 to 124 inverse watts per kilometer. The study also examines the effect of isopropyl alcohol infiltration, which causes a red-shift in dispersion and degrades confinement. These results offer a design framework that balances nonlinear efficiency and environmental robustness for supercontinuum generation and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Digital defocus aberration interference for automated optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation in optical microscopy is critical for enabling high-throughput imaging across a wide range of biomedical applications. Among the essential components of automated systems, robust autofocusing plays a pivotal role in maintaining image quality for both single-plane and volumetric imaging. However, conventional autofocusing methods often struggle with implementation complexity, limited generalizability across sample types, incompatibility with thick specimens, and slow feedback. We recently discovered a phenomenon that the digitally summed Fourier spectrum of two images acquired from two-angle illumination exhibits interference-like fringe modulation when the sample is defocused. These digital fringes correlate directly with defocus through a physics-based relation. Based on this principle, we developed an automatic, efficient, and generalizable defocus detection method termed digital defocus aberration interference (DAbI). Implemented with a simple two-LED setup, DAbI can quantify the defocus distance over a range of 212 times the depth-of-field (DoF) for thin samples and 300 times for thick specimens. It can additionally extend the natural DoF of the imaging system by 20 folds when integrated with complex-field imaging. We demonstrated the versatile applications of DAbI on brightfield, complex-field, refractive index, confocal, and widefield fluorescence imaging, establishing it as a promising solution for automated, high-throughput optical microscopy.</description>

      <title>Temporal Brewster anomaly and collimated wave steering in Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal disorder-random temporal fluctuations of material parameters-has recently emerged as an effective tool for controlling wave propagation, analogous to Anderson localization in spatially disordered systems. Here, we theoretically introduce and analyze the temporal Brewster anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems, demonstrating that Dirac waves remain delocalized along a vector potential with fixed direction despite random temporal variations in its magnitude. In contrast, waves propagating at any off-axis angle exhibit pronounced spatial localization and diffusive behavior. This directional selectivity arises from temporal impedance matching, previously identified as the mechanism suppressing temporal reflection along the vector potential axis. By analyzing temporal reflectance, wave group velocity, and pulse propagation, we establish that these systems function as dynamic directional filters, achieving collimated wave steering purely through temporal modulation. In Dirac materials, external electric fields or mechanical strain can dynamically control the orientation and strength of the vector potential modulation, enabling precise, real-time tuning of directional wave transmission. The temporal Brewster anomaly thus offers a robust and versatile approach for adaptive wave steering, promising significant technological applications in electronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Statistical regimes of electromagnetic wave propagation in randomly time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic waves in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, exponential behavior at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields true log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated by extensive calculations using two complementary disorder models-delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations-demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry and temporal dynamics. Momentum conservation further constrains long-term behavior, linking initial conditions to energy growth. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa&gt;1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations reveal that these edge states exhibit robust localization and characteristic nodal structures, with their properties strongly dependent on the edge configurations of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states (emerging for $\kappa \ge 4$) are fragile and disappear under strong disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional single-crystal photonic scintillator for enhanced X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of X-ray detection technology has significantly enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution in non-destructive imaging of internal structure. However, the problem of low luminescence and transparency of scintillator materials restricts imaging with lower radiation doses and thicker materials. Here, we propose a two-dimensional photonic scintillator for single crystal and demonstrate that the optical guiding effect emerging from the structure reduces luminescence leakage and increases the signal intensity by around a factor of 2 from 200 to 450 kV. This approach has the potential to enhance the output rate by an order of magnitude. The photonic structure features a fine array pitch and large-scale detection area with fast fabrication time. Our scheme paves the way for high sensitivity X-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>Silicon nitride on-chip C-band spontaneous emission generation based on lanthanide doped microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of active light-emitting elements into planar photonic circuits on a silicon nitride platform remains challenging due to material incompatibilities and high-temperature processing. Proposed hybrid method embeds monodisperse luminescent particles into lithographically defined wells above a 200 nm-thick silicon nitride taper coupler. A fabrication process involving wells etching, particle deposition, and planarization enables precise integration while maintaining waveguide integrity. When pumped at 950 nm with a diode laser, the device emits broadband radiation in the 1500-1600 nm range, covering the optical telecommunication C-band. Numerical simulations yield an average coupling efficiency of 0.25% into the fundamental waveguide mode, suggesting significant potential for further device optimization. The approach provides a scalable route for integrating broadband telecommunications emitters on a silicon nitride platform.</description>

      <title>Energy Balance and Optical Theorem for Time-Modulated Subwavelength Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave propagation through a one-dimensional array of subwavelength resonators with periodically time-modulated material parameters. Focusing on a high-contrast regime, we use a scattering framework based on Fourier expansions and scattering matrix techniques to capture the interactions between an incident wave and the temporally varying system. This way, we derive a formulation of the total energy flux corresponding to time-dependent systems of resonators. We show that the total energy flux is composed of the transmitted and reflected energy fluxes, and derive an optical theorem which characterises the energy balance of the system. We provide a number of numerical experiments to investigate the impact of the time-dependency, the operating frequency and the number of resonators on the maximal attainable energy gain and energy loss. Moreover, we show the existence of lasing points, at which the total energy diverges. Our results lay the foundation for the design of energy dissipative or energy amplifying systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced THz third-harmonic generation in graphene via hot-carriers in a topological cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising material for nonlinear THz applications owing to its high third-order susceptibility and tunable optical properties. Its strong nonlinear response, driven by free-carrier thermodynamics, facilitates efficient third-harmonic generation (THG), which can be further enhanced using resonant metasurfaces and plasmonic structures. In this study, we use a platform that integrates graphene ribbons at the interface of topological photonic crystals designed to boost THG at low THz frequencies. To accurately capture the temperature dependence of the nonlinear optical response, we perform coupled simulations to model graphene's optical and thermodynamic responses under THz photoexcitation, incorporating photoinduced hot carrier effects within a multiphysics computational framework. This approach unveils the influence of carrier heating on THG, providing a more accurate description of nonlinear THz processes and revealing previously overlooked mechanisms of third-order conductivity modulation. We show that the elevated carrier temperature promotes high conversion efficiencies at moderate input intensities, within a design that operates in both reflection and transmission modes for advanced ultrafast optoelectronic devices in the THz regime.</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>ND1 centers in diamond for long-term data storage in extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practically feasible long-term data storage under extreme conditions is an unsolved problem in modern data storage systems. This study introduces a novel approach using ND1 centers in diamonds for high-density, three-dimensional optical data storage. By employing near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses, we demonstrate the creation of sub-micron ND1 defect sites with precise spatial control, enabling efficient data encoding as luminescent ''pits." The ND1 centers exhibit robust photoluminescence in the UV spectrum, driven by three-photon absorption, which intrinsically provides a 3D reading of the data. Remarkably, these centers remain stable under extreme electric and magnetic fields, temperatures ranging from 4 K to 500 K, and corrosive chemical environments, with no degradation observed over extended periods. A reading speed of 500 MBits/s, limited by the lifetime of the photoluminescence, surpasses conventional Blu-ray technology while maintaining compatibility with existing optical data storage infrastructure. Our findings highlight diamond-based ND1 centers as a promising medium for durable, high-capacity data storage, capable of preserving critical information for millions of years, even under harsh conditions.</description>

      <title>Primordial Media: the shrouded realm of composite materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic composites (metamaterials) recently underwent explosive growth fueled, in part, by advances in nanofabrication. It is commonly believed that as the size of the components decreases, the behavior of a composite converges to the response of a homogeneous material. Here we show that this intuitive understanding of the electromagnetic response of composite media is fundamentally flawed, even at the qualitative level. In contrast to the well-understood local effective medium response, the properties of nanostructured composites can be dominated by electromagnetic nonlocality. We demonstrate that the interplay between the nonlocality and the structural inhomogeneity introduces two fundamentally new electromagnetic regimes, primordial metamaterials and nonlocal effective medium. We develop an analytical description of these regimes and show that the behavior of metamaterials in the limits of vanishing nonlocality and of vanishing component size do not commute. Our work opens a new dimension in the design space of nanostructured electromagnetic composites.</description>

      <title>Solving Distance-Based Optimization Problems Using Optical Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical approach to solving distance-based optimization problems using optical computing hardware. The objective is to minimize an energy function defined as the weighted sum of squared differences between measured distances and the squared Euclidean distances of point coordinates. By representing coordinates as complex numbers, we map the optimization problem onto optical fields, enabling its solution through either the canonical transformation (CT) method or the gain-based bifurcation (GBB) method. To further enhance the performance of the CT method, we introduce two techniques: asynchronous update and steepened gradient. Both the CT and GBB methods can effectively solve the distance-based problem and are adaptable to various optical hardware platforms. Our optical implementation is inspired by recent progress in analog optical computing for combinatorial optimization, highlighting its promise for efficient and scalable problem-solving in high-dimensional settings.</description>

Abstract: Lidar with direct time-of-flight (dToF) technology based on single-photon avalanche diode detectors (SPAD) has been widely adopted in various applications. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its fundamental ranging performance limits--particularly the degradation caused by pile-up effects due to system dead time and the potential benefits of photon-number-resolving architectures--remains incomplete. In this work, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for dToF systems is theoretically derived accounting for dead time effects, generalized to SPAD detectors with photon-number-resolving capabilities, and are further validated through Monte Carlo simulations and maximum likelihood estimation. Our results reveal that pile-up not only reduces the information contained within individual ToF but also introduces statistical coupling between distance and photon flux rate, further degrading ranging precision. The derived CRLB is used to determine the optimal optical photon flux, laser pulse width, and ToF quantization resolution that yield the best achievable ranging precision. The analysis further quantifies the limited performance improvement enabled by increased photon-number resolution, which exhibits rapidly diminishing returns. These findings provide theoretical guidance for the design of dToF systems and the selection of their optimal operating points.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven few-cycle Terahertz sources with high average power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser-driven terahertz sources are gaining in popularity in an increasingly wide range of scientific and technological applications. However, many fields continue to be severely limited by the typically low average power of these sources, which restricts speed, signal-to-noise ratio, and dynamic range in numerous measurements. Conversely, the past two decades have seen spectacular progress in high average power ultrafast laser technology based on Ytterbium lasers, rendering hundreds of watts to kilowatts of average power available to this community to drive THz sources. This has opened the young field of high-average-power laserdriven THz time-domain spectroscopy, which holds the potential to revolutionize the applications of THz time-domain systems. In this perspective article, we discuss this young field and emphasize recent advancements in broadband terahertz sources utilizing high-power Yb-based ultrafast lasers as drivers, which are nearing watt-level average power. We discuss various approaches explored thus far, current challenges, prospects for scaling, and future research areas that will accelerate their implementation in applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Noise Model of Nonlinear Distortions from Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gaussian Noise Model of the nonlinear noise power spectral density is developed for a semiconductor optical amplifier as described by the Agrawal model. A simple closed-form expression is obtained for the nonlinear noise-to-signal ratio of broadband wavelength-division multiplexed signals as a function of the Agrawal model parameters, the amplifier output power and the transmission bandwidth. The accuracy of the closed-form expression and its region of validity is assessed in numerical simulations. The error is smaller than 0.1 dB when the product of bandwidth and gain recovery time $B\times\tau_c$ exceeds 100.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that the event rate for $\nu^{}_{i} \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S}$ at the resonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \sim 5~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a nominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\rm m}$. Parity mixing by the Stark effect may help to further magnify the signal rate.</description>

      <title>Disordered Photosynthetic Aggregates Can Host Functional Vibronic Couplings At Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on a network of chlorophyll-like molecules which together lead to efficient long-range energy funneling. Evidence at cryogenic temperatures suggests that mechanistic details of energy/charge transfer must invoke delocalized vibronic states. Whether these survive at physiological temperature in large photosynthetic aggregates is an open question. Parallel research on artificial templates has relied on cyanines which are unlike chlorophylls. We report two-dimensional electronic spectra of porphyrin nanotubes where we selectively probe mixed Qx-Qy states through polarization control. Early time cross-peaks, their rapid broadening and survival of anisotropic Qx-Qy quantum beats conclusively demonstrate that overlapping vibrational-electronic bands of photosynthetic aggregates indeed host functional vibronic couplings at room temperature. Calculations reveal that disorder is the vital ingredient that dramatically enhances Qx-Qy vibronic mixing across the entire Q band. The parameter regime where energetic disorder is of the order of dense Raman-active vibrations with weak reorganization energies may be the key design principle.</description>

      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system (DS) found in a photonics system. In this DS, robust causality is created, and as a result, it becomes possible to find behavior that can be understood as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). Furthermore, by arranging such DSs as basic elements and building certain relationships between them through optical interference, it becomes possible to create a unique system that causes complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the MBLS and the Ising model, it can be used as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Sub-microsecond electric switching of large birefringence in the isotropic phase of ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional nonpolar nematic liquid crystals, widely known for their successful display applications, are not well-suited for fast electro-optical switching because of the slow (milliseconds) field-off relaxation of the director. In this work, we demonstrate sub-microsecond field-on and field-off switching of a large (~0.1) birefringence by applying a moderate electric field (30-100) V/{\mu}m, to an isotropic film of a ferroelectric nematic material. This highly efficient electro-optical switching is rooted in the recently discovered field-induced isotropic to ferroelectric nematic phase transition [J. Szydlowska et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 216802 (2023)]. The demonstrated sub-microsecond switching of ferroelectric birefringence induced by field (FBIF) has the potential for applications in fast-switching electro-optic devices, such as phase modulators, light shutters, beam steerers, switchable optical compensators.</description>

      <title>Quantized decay charges in non-Hermitian networks characterized by directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes: eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics, signal processing, and beyond, harnessing the unique topological properties of non-Hermitian networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of single biomolecules is essential for unlocking new frontiers in biophysics and medicine. Here, we present a transformative approach using metamaterial optical tweezers to trap and study individual urease molecules - an enzyme that catalyzes urea hydrolysis and serves as a key biomarker for pathogenic infections. By generating thermally induced drifts and rapid hydrodynamic flows with optically induced local temperature fields at the metamaterial/water interface, we achieve unprecedented guidance and control over single urease molecules at low trapping laser intensities of 0.13~mW/{\mu}m^2 facilitating their precise delivery to plasmonic hotspots. The interplay of thermophoresis, thermo-osmosis and depletion forces shapes the trapping potential, enabling real-time observation of ureases` conformational changes and interactions with the environment. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of enzyme dynamics but also paves the way for label-free characterization of biomolecules, ushering in a new era in life sciences and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband Milliwatt-Level Resonant Frequency Doubling on a Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microresonators are powerful tools to enhance the efficiency of second-order nonlinear optical processes, such as second-harmonic generation, which can coherently bridge octave-spaced spectral bands. However, dispersion constraints such as phase-matching and doubly resonant conditions have so far limited demonstrations to narrowband operation. In this work, we overcome these limitations showing ultrabroadband resonant frequency doubling in a novel integrated device, wherein the resonant enhancement of pump and second harmonic are individually addressed in two distinct and linearly uncoupled microring resonators, each adjusted to target the respective spectral band. The two microresonators are designed and tuned independently, yet share a common interaction region that grants nonlinear coupling over a quasi-phase-matching bandwidth exceeding 200 nm, enabled by the inscription of a photoinduced $\chi^{(2)}$ grating. The system allows to not only conveniently disentangle the design parameters of the two microresonators but also to reconfigure the doubly resonant condition electrically, and the phase-matching condition optically. We demonstrate milliwatt-level addressable second-harmonic generation over the entire telecom band and then configure the device to internally generate and upconvert a Kerr frequency comb with bandwidth exceeding 100 nm and upconverted power up to 10 mW.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and classifying chiral structural color of scarab beetles across the phylogenetic tree is an important scientific tool to explore the origins of the homochiral optical response in biological structures with a potential relation to the homochirality of (chitin) molecules. We report hyperspectral polarization resolved images of the scarab beetle \textit{Protaetia speciosa jousselini} (Gory \&amp; Percheron, 1833) and resolve the state of polarization as a function of both position (spatial resolution of $\sim$20 $\mu$m $\times$ 10 $\mu$m) and wavelength (spectral resolution of 5.5 nm). We observe a strong left-handed chiral Bragg reflection and analyze the center wavelength and width of the spectrum. The reflection and state of polarization scale with the center wavelength of the Bragg reflection, while the relative width of reflection spectrum is characterized by a chiral photonic strength parameter $\psi_C \approx 0.14$ that is independent of the reflected color and position. Based on the self-similarity of the reflection spectra we interpret variation in reflectivity as variations in the thickness of the chiral Bragg reflector across the beetle.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing based Single-Lane Abnormal Event Detection in Low-Density Traffic Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) based traffic flow monitoring systems are a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring solution that utilize existing fiber infrastructure along roads. These systems analyse vehicle vibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events. However, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of non-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by presence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds do not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple vehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles on travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion. Thus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar location, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This paper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane abnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections. We first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and estimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle lane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for two different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path tracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential for detecting occurrence of single-lane abnormal events in low-density traffic flow so that necessary mitigation measures can be initiated before onset of traffic congestions.</description>

Abstract: Efficient, low-power, and highly integrated optoelectronic devices remain a critical yet challenging goal.Here, we introduce the extended Kerker effect paradigm that synergizes Kerker's condition with quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) to overcome these limitations. By engineering dual-mode dispersion, we achieve a high efficiency beam deflector using a membrane metasurface, simultaneously realizing robust parameter tolerance and narrow-linewidth resonances-two typically conflicting properties.Our experiment demonstrates an absolute beam deflection efficiency exceeding 92%, with exceptional spectral and spatial selectivity, including a 4 GHz linewidth, a 2.8o divergence angle, and a quality factor of 114. Additionally, it enables 94% transmission intensity modulation at a pump intensity as low as 0.5 W/cm2 in experiments. The extended Kerker effect provides a scalable platform for energy-efficient and integrable optoelectronic devices, paving the way for transformative advancements in next-generation wireless communications and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced second-harmonic generation in quantum paraelectrics: hot-phonon effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.</description>

      <title>Double metasurfaces and Optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs metalenses that separate homogeneous media with different refractive indices, refracting one domain into another while conserving a prescribed energy distribution. Using optimal transport theory, we design singlet and doublet metalenses satisfying energy conservation by refraction, and obtain partial regularity of the optimal maps involved.</description>

      <title>Counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in lithium niobate on insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</description>
