      <title>Lie dialgebras, gauge theory, and Lagrangian multiforms for integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiforms provide a variational framework for describing integrable hierarchies. This thesis presents two approaches for systematically constructing Lagrangian one-forms, which cover the case of finite-dimensional integrable hierarchies, thus addressing one of the central open problems in the theory of Lagrangian multiforms. The first approach, based on the theory of Lie dialgebras, incorporates into Lagrangian one-forms the notion of the classical $r$-matrix and produces Lagrangian one-forms living on coadjoint orbits. We prove an important structural result relating the closure relation for Lagrangian one-forms to the Poisson involutivity of Hamiltonians and the double zero on Euler-Lagrange equations. In the second approach, we extend the notion of Lagrangian one-forms to the setting of gauge theories and derive a variational formulation of the Hitchin system associated with a compact Riemann surface of arbitrary genus. We show that this description corresponds to a Lagrangian one-form for classical $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory coupled with so-called type A and type B defects. Notably, this establishes an explicit connection between $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory and the Hitchin system at the classical level. Further, we derive a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. As applications of the two approaches, we also obtain explicit Lagrangian one-forms for the hierarchies of various well-known integrable models.</description>

      <title>Causal quantum-mechanical localization observables in lattices of real projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical observables for spatial and spacetime localization are considered from a lattice-theoretic perspective. It is shown that when replacing the lattice of all complex orthogonal projections underlying the Born rule by the lattice of real linear projections with symplectic complementation, the well-known No-Go theorems of Hegerfeldt and Malament no longer apply: Causal and Poincar\'e covariant localization observables exist. In this setting, several features of quantum field theory, such as Lorentz symmetry and modular localization, emerge automatically. In the case of a particle described by a massive positive energy representation of the Poincar\'e group, the Brunetti-Guido-Longo map defines a spacetime localization observable that is unique under some natural further assumptions. Regarding possible probabilistic interpretations of such a structure, a Gleason theorem and a cluster theorem for symplectic complements are established. These imply that evaluating such localization observables in states yields a fuzzy probability measure that fails to be a measure because it is not additive. However, for separation scales that are large in comparison to the Compton wavelength, the emerging modular localization picture is essentially additive and approximates the one of Newton-Wigner.</description>

      <title>What is a Fluctuation Theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book provides a modern review of Fluctuation Relations and Fluctuation Theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. It focuses on the pioneering perspectives of Gallavotti and Cohen, according to which a fluctuation theorem describes the statistics of the deviations of entropy production from its expected value. For time-reversal invariant systems, these fluctuations obey a universal (i.e., model-independent) symmetry called the fluctuation relation. The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.</description>

      <title>On the interaction between a rigid-body and a viscous-fluid: existence of a weak solution and a suitable Th\'eor\`eme de Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and a partial regularity of a weak solution to the system governing the interaction between a rigid body and a viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid. The evolution of the system body-fluid is studied in a frame attached to the body. The choice of this special frame becomes critical from an analytical point of view due to the presence of the term $\omega\times x\cdot\nabla u$ in the balance of momentum equation for the fluid. As a consequence, we are forced to look for a technique that is different from the ones usually employed both for the existence and for the partial regularity of a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes problem. Hence, we prove the existence of a weak solution in an original way and give a new proof of the celebrated Th\'eor\`eme de Structure due to Leray. However, the regularity obtained for our weak solution is only for large times, hence our result is weaker compared to the one obtained by Leray.</description>

      <title>Two-point functions in boundary loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques of conformal bootstrap, we propose analytical expressions for a large class of two-point functions of bulk fields in critical loop models defined on the upper-half plane. Our results include the two-point connectivities in the Fortuin--Kasteleyn random cluster model with both free and wired boundary conditions. We link the continuum expressions to lattice quantities by computing universal ratios of amplitudes for the two-point connectivities, and find excellent agreement with transfer-matrix numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dilute quantum gas of interacting spin-1/2 fermions in the thermodynamic limit. For a trial state that resolves the ground state energy up to the precision of the Huang--Yang formula, we rigorously derive its momentum distribution. Our result agrees with the formal perturbative argument of Belyakov (Sov. Phys. JETP 13: 850--851 (1961)).</description>

      <title>Matrix bordering structure of the Faddeev-Jackiw algorithm: Schur complement regularization and symbolic automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the iterative Faddeev-Jackiw (FJ) reduction for singular Lagrangian systems constitutes a geometrically constrained instance of the Matrix Bordering Technique (MBT). For a first-order Lagrangian with singular pre-symplectic form, each iteration of the Barcelos-Neto-Wotzasek algorithm produces an extended symplectic matrix of canonical bordered form, \begin{eqnarray}
  f^{(m)} = \left( \begin{matrix}
  f^{(0)} &amp; B \\ -B^{\mathsf{T}} &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right) \end{eqnarray} where the bordering block $B$ is determined by the gradients of the consistency constraints. We prove that the nondegeneracy of the extended matrix is governed by the corresponding Schur complement, which is algebraically isomorphic to the Poisson bracket matrix of constraints. As a consequence, the Faddeev-Jackiw algorithm terminates if and only if the constraint algebra is nondegenerate, i.e., when the constraints form a second-class system. This algebraic characterization provides a rigorous foundation for automating the Faddeev-Jackiw procedure symbolically. We present a fully symbolic implementation in the Wolfram Language, and validate the approach on representative mechanical systems with nontrivial constraint structure. The resulting rule-based engine preserves parametric dependencies throughout the reduction, enabling reliable analysis of degeneracy, structural stability (when no bifurcations occur), and possible bifurcation scenarios as critical parameters are varied.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter Sigma Model from Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel two-field four-dimensional integrable field theory (IFT) from 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. The four-dimensional IFT depends on a skew-symmetric linear operator acting on a Lie algebra, and when this operator is specialised to a solution of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the IFT develops a semi-local symmetry associated with this solution. The resulting 4d analogue of the Yang-Baxter sigma model is related by symmetry reduction to the well-known 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model. An important implication that we find is the embedding of the equations of motion of the 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model in the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The 6d Chern-Simons theory on twistor space can alternatively be symmetry reduced to a 4d Chern-Simons theory configuration with disorder surface defects. The latter realises the Yang-Baxter sigma model, implying a "diamond" for the Yang-Baxter sigma model obtained from twistor space.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear $q$-Deformed Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new nonlinear deformed Schr\"odinger structure using a nonlinear derivative operator which depends on a parameter $q$. This operator recovers Newton derivative when $q \rightarrow 1$. Using this operator we propose a deformed Lagrangian which gives us a deformed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a nonlinear kinetic energy term and a standard potential $V(\vec{x})$. We analytically solve the nonlinear deformed Schr\"odinger equation for $V(\vec{x}) = 0$ and $q \simeq1$. This model has a continuity equation, the energy is conserved, as well as the momentum and also interacts with electromagnetic field. Planck relation remains valid and in all steps we easily recover the undeformed quantities when the deformation parameter goes to 1. Finally, we numerically solve the equation of motion for the free particle in any spatial dimension, which shows a solitonic pattern when the space is equal to one for particular values of $q$.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-Pochhammer symbol $(z;q)_\infty$ as an infinite product of gamma functions, analogously to how Narukawa expressed the elliptic gamma function as an infinite product of hyperbolic gamma functions. This identity is used to obtain asymptotic expansions when $q$ tends to $1$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Spans and Enforced Gaplessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.</description>

      <title>Parity-dependent double degeneracy and spectral statistics in the projected dice lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of an interacting fermionic system derived by projecting the Hubbard interaction onto the two lowest-energy, degenerate flat bands of the dice lattice subjected to a $\pi$-flux. Surprisingly, the distributions of level spacings and gap ratios correspond to distinct Gaussian ensembles, depending on the parity of the particle number. For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel finite-element methods for planetary gravitation: DtN and multipole expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson equation governing a planet's gravitational field is posed on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^3$, whereas finite-element computations require bounded meshes. We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Theorem and Thermodynamic Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.05167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) for entropy production in chaotic discrete-time dynamical systems on compact metric spaces, and extend it to empirical measures, all continuous potentials, and all weak Gibbs states. In particular, we establish the FT in the phase transition regime. These results hold under minimal chaoticity assumptions (expansiveness and specification) and require no ergodicity conditions. They are also valid for systems that are not necessarily invertible and involutions other than time reversal. Further extensions involve asymptotically additive potential sequences and the corresponding weak Gibbs measures. The generality of these results allows to view the FT as a structural facet of the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot resonances in high-contrast resonator systems and study the properties of their associated resonant modes from continuous differential models. We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation.</description>

      <title>Parametric reflection maps: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study solutions of the parametric set-theoretic reflection equation from an algebraic perspective by employing recently derived generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks, called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. Generic invertible solutions of the set-theoretic reflection equation are also obtained by a suitable parametric twist. The twist leads to considerably simplified constraints compared to the ones obtained from general set-theoretic reflections. In this context, novel algebraic structures of (skew) p-braces that generalize the known (skew) braces and are suitable for the parametric Yang-Baxter equation are introduced. The p-rack Yang-Baxter and reflection operators as well as the associated algebraic structures are defined setting up the frame for formulating the p-rack reflection algebra.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic Newton-Cartan Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An application of the Newton-Cartan framework to the study of membranes is presented. Specifically, for membranes of co-dimension one in hydrostatic equilibrium embedded in a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime. For such membranes, the corresponding equilibrium partition function at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion is shown. Equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations are found. For the generically non-constant elastic subset of thermodynamic coefficients, the Young-Laplace equation is presented for the case of two-dimensional axisymmetric closed membranes embedded in a flat three-dimensional spacetime with constant ambient vorticity. Some numerical solutions to this Young-Laplace equation are examined, and some analytic solutions for particular choices of the thermodynamic coefficients are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad problem and the geometry of CP maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of
  open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. We prove a generalization, with time-dependent generator, as an application of an investigation of the geometry of the class of completely positive (CP) maps. The treatment of the finite-dimensional setting is based on a basis-free Choi-Jamio\l{}kowski type isomorphism. The infinite-dimensional case is bootstrapped from the finite-dimensional theory via a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations. Kraus decomposition is established along the way, in the guise of an extremal decomposition of the closed convex cone of CP maps. No appeal is made to results from the representation theory of operator algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are a central concept in our understanding of physics. In quantum theories, a quantum reference frame (QRF) can be used to distinguish between observables related by a symmetry. The framework of operational QRFs provides a means to describe observables in terms of their relation to a reference quantum system. We discuss a number of applications of QRFs in the context of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes: 1) A type reduction result for algebras arising from QFTs and QRFs with good thermal properties. 2) Quantisation of boundary electric fluxes and gluing procedures for quantum electromagnetism on spacetimes with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Small-$b$ expansion of the DOZZ formula for light operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point structure constant in the light-operator regime \(\alpha_i=b\sigma_i\) as \(b\to0\). In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor \({\cal P(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\) and a power series in \(b^2\): \[ C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3)={\cal P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigg[1+\sum_{n\ge1}b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigg]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic expansion of the \(\Upsilon_b\)-function we derive closed-form expressions for the leading coefficients \(\Omega_n(\sigma_i)\) and show that each \(\Omega_n\) is a symmetric polynomial in the variables \(\sigma_i\). Our expansion provides explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude. Finally, we formulate a perturbative Liouville program for celestial amplitudes and outline directions for further development.</description>

      <title>Topological Preparation of Non-Stabilizer States and Clifford Evolution in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework for preparing families of non-stabilizer states, and computing their entanglement entropies, in $SU(2)_1$ Chern-Simons theory. Using the Kac-Moody algebra, we construct Pauli and Clifford operators as path integrals over 3-manifolds with Wilson loop insertions, enabling an explicit topological realization of $W_n$ and Dicke states, as well as their entanglement properties. We further establish a correspondence between Clifford group action and modular transformations generated by Dehn twists on genus-$g$ surfaces, linking the mapping class group to quantum operations. Our results extend existing topological constructions for stabilizer states to include families of non-stabilizer states, improving the geometric interpretation of entanglement and quantum resources in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Globally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>
