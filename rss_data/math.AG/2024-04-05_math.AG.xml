      <title>Projections of Curves and Conic Multiview Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algebraic study of the projection of plane curves and twisted cubics in space onto multiple images of pinhole cameras. The Zariski closure of the image of the projection of conics is a conic multiview varieties. Extending previous work for point and line multiview varieties, we use back-projected cones to describe these varieties. For two views, we provide the defining ideal of the multiview variety. For any number of views, we state when the simplest possible set-theoretic description is achieved based on the geometry of the camera centers. Finally, we investigate the complexity of the associated triangulation problem and conjecture the Euclidean distance degree for the conic multiview variety for two cameras.</description>

      <title>Irreducible symplectic varieties via relative Prym varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing work of Markushevich--Tikhomirov and Arbarello--Sacc\`a--Ferretti, we use relative Prym varieties to construct Lagrangian fibered symplectic varieties in infinitely many dimensions. We then give criteria for when the construction yields primitive symplectic varieties, respectively, irreducible symplectic varieties. The starting point of the construction is a K3 surface endowed with an anti-symplectic involution and an effective linear system on the quotient surface. We give sufficient conditions on the linear system to ensure that the relative Prym varieties satisfy the criteria above. As a consequence, we produce infinite series of irreducible symplectic varieties.</description>

      <title>Explicit Sarkisov program for regular surfaces over arbitrary fields and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Sarkisov program for projective surfaces over excellent base rings, including the case of non-perfect base fields of characteristic p&gt;0. We classify the Sarkisov links between Mori fibre spaces and their relations for regular surfaces, generalising work of Iskovskikh. As an application, we discuss rationality problems for regular surfaces and the structure of the plane Cremona group.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the $\mathcal{K}_{p,1}$ Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a non-degenerate projective irreducible variety of dimension $n \ge 1$, degree $d$, and codimension $e \ge 2$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic $0$. Let $\beta_{p,q} (X)$ be the $(p,q)$-th graded Betti number of $X$. M. Green proved the celebrating $\mathcal K_{p,1}$-theorem about the vanishing of $\beta_{p,1} (X)$ for high values for $p$ and potential examples of nonvanishing graded Betti numbers. Later, Nagel-Pitteloud and Brodmann-Schenzel classified varieties with nonvanishing $\beta_{e-1,1}(X)$. It is clear that $\beta_{e-1,1}(X) \neq 0$ when there is an $(n+1)$-dimensional variety of minimal degree containing $X$, however, this is not always the case as seen in the example of the triple Veronese surface in $\mathbb{P}^9$. In this paper, we completely classify varieties $X$ with nonvanishing $\beta_{e-1,1}(X) \neq 0$ such that $X$ does not lie on an $(n+1)$-dimensional variety of minimal degree. They are exactly cones over smooth del Pezzo varieties whose Picard number is $\le n-1$.</description>

      <title>Defect of irreducible plane curves with simple singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the defect of singular plane curve that was recently introduced by Dimca. Roughly speaking, the defect of a reduced plane curve measures the discrepancy from the property of being a free curve. We find some lower-bound on the defect for certain classes of irreducible plane curves admitting nodes, ordinary cusps and ordinary triple points. The main result of the note tells us that reduced simply singular plane curves with sufficiently high Arnold exponents are never free.</description>

      <title>Coulomb branch surgery: Holonomy saddles, S-folds and discrete symmetry gaugings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries of Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries capture intricate physical aspects of the underlying 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ field theories. For rank-one theories, these geometries are rational elliptic surfaces whose automorphism group is a semi-direct product between the Coulomb branch (CB) symmetries and the Mordell-Weil group. We study quotients of the SW geometry by subgroups of its automorphism group, which most naturally become gaugings of discrete 0- and 1-form symmetries. Yet, new interpretations of these surgeries become evident when considering 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. There, certain CB symmetries are related to symmetries of the corresponding $(p,q)$-brane web and, as a result, CB surgeries can give rise to (fractional) S-folds. Another novel interpretation of these quotients is the folding across dimensions: circle compactifications of the 5d $E_{2N_f + 1}$ Seiberg theories lead in the infrared to two copies of locally indistinguishable 4d SU(2) SQCD theories with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. This extends earlier results on holonomy saddles, while also reproducing detailed computations of 5d BPS spectra and predicting new 5d and 6d BPS quivers. Finally, we argue that the semi-direct product structure of the automorphism group of the SW geometry includes mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the 0- and 1-form symmetries, and we also present some new results on non-cyclic CB symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>Affine Demazure Weight Polytopes and Twisted Bruhat Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan and Borel subalgebras $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{g}$, affine Demazure modules are certain $U(\mathfrak{b})$-submodules of the irreducible highest-weight representations of $\mathfrak{g}$. We introduce here the associated affine Demazure weight polytopes, given by the convex hull of the $\mathfrak{h}$-weights of such a module. Using methods of geometric invariant theory, we determine inequalities which define these polytopes; these inequalities come in three distinct flavors, specified by the standard, opposite, or semi-infinite Bruhat orders. We also give a combinatorial characterization of the vertices of these polytopes lying on an arbitrary face, utilizing the more general class of twisted Bruhat orders.</description>

      <title>Geometry of degenerate quantum states, configurations of $m$-planes and invariants on complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometric information contained in quantum states is valuable in various branches of physics, particularly in solid-state physics when Bloch states play a crucial role. While the Fubini-Study metric and Berry curvature form offer comprehensive descriptions of non-degenerate quantum states, a similar description for degenerate states did not exist. In this work, we fill this gap by showing how to reduce the geometry of degenerate states to the non-abelian (Wilczek-Zee) connection $A$ and a previously unexplored matrix-valued metric tensor $G$. Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to finding the $U(N)$ invariants of a configuration of subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$. For two subspaces, the configuration was known to be described by a set of $m$ principal angles that generalize the notion of quantum distance. For more subspaces, we find $3 m^2 - 3 m + 1$ additional independent invariants associated with each triple of subspaces. Some of them generalize the Berry-Pancharatnam phase, and some do not have analogues for 1-dimensional subspaces. We also develop a procedure for calculating these invariants as integrals of $A$ and $G$ over geodesics on the Grassmannain manifold. Finally, we briefly discuss possible application of these results to quantum state preparation and $PT$-symmetric band structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the landscape of F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau fourfolds whose complex structure moduli space is the thrice-punctured sphere. As a first part, we enumerate all such Calabi--Yau fourfolds under the additional requirement that it has a large complex structure and conifold point at two of the punctures. We find 14 monodromy tuples by demanding the monodromy around infinity to be quasi-unipotent. As second part, we study the four different types of phases arising at infinity. For each we consider a working example where we determine the leading periods and other physical couplings. We also included a notebook that sets up the period vectors for any of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the complexity of computing Gr\"{o}bner bases is an important problem both in theory and in practice, and for that the solving degree plays a key role. In this paper, we study the solving degrees of affine semi-regular sequences and their homogenized sequences. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence. This paper is a sequel of the authors' previous work and gives additional results on the solving degrees and important behaviors of Gr\"obner basis computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12246v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}=(L,[\cdot\,,\cdot],\delta)$ be an algebraic Lie algebroid over a smooth projective curve $X$ of genus $g\geq 2$ such that $L$ is a line bundle whose degree is less than $2-2g$. Let $r$ and $d$ be coprime numbers. We prove that the motivic class of the moduli space of $\mathcal{L}$-connections of rank $r$ and degree $d$ over $X$ does not depend on the Lie algebroid structure $[\cdot\,,\cdot]$ and $\delta$ of $\mathcal{L}$ and neither on the line bundle $L$ itself, but only on the degree of $L$ (and of course on $r$, $d$ and $X$). In particular it is equal to the motivic class of the moduli space of $K_X(D)$-twisted Higgs bundles of rank $r$ and degree $d$, for $D$ any effective divisor with the appropriate degree. As a consequence, similar results (actually slightly stronger) are obtained for the corresponding $E$-polynomials. Some applications of these results are then deduced.</description>

      <title>The moduli stack of principal $\rho$-sheaves and Gieseker-Harder-Narasimhan filtrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03918v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let X be a smooth projective variety and let G be a connected reductive group, both defined over a field of characteristic 0. Given a faithful representation $\rho$ of G into a product of general linear groups, we define a moduli stack of principal $\rho$-sheaves that compactifies the stack of G-bundles on X. We apply the theory developed by Alper, Halpern-Leistner and Heinloth to construct a moduli space of Gieseker semistable principal $\rho$-sheaves. This provides an intrinsic stack-theoretic construction of the moduli space of semistable singular principal bundles as constructed by Schmitt and G\'omez-Langer-Schmitt-Sols.
  Our second main result is the definition of a schematic Gieseker-Harder-Narasimhan filtration for $\rho$-sheaves, which induces a stratification of the stack by locally closed substacks. This filtration for a general reductive group G is a refinement of the canonical slope parabolic reductions previously considered at the level of points by Anchouche-Azad-Biswas and as a stratification of the stack by Gurjar-Nitsure. In an appendix, we apply the same techniques to define Gieseker-Harder-Narasimhan filtrations in arbitrary characteristic and show that they induce a stratification of the stack by radicial morphisms.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a version of the P=W conjecture relating the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of representations of the fundamental group of a genus g Riemann surface with the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of degree zero semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective complex curve of genus $g$. In order to state the conjecture we propose a construction of a canonical isomorphism between these Borel-Moore homology groups. We relate the stacky P=W conjecture with the original P=W conjecture concerning the cohomology of smooth moduli spaces of twisted objects, and the PI=WI conjecture concerning the intersection cohomology groups of singular moduli spaces of untwisted objects. In genus zero and one, we prove the conjectures that we introduce in this paper.</description>

Abstract: Working on Berkovich analytic curves, we propose a geometric approach to the study of the Hasse principle over function fields of curves defined over a complete discretely valued field. Using it, we show the Hasse principle to be verified for certain families of projective homogeneous spaces. As a consequence, we also obtain said principle in the already known cases of quadratic forms and homogeneous varieties over unitary groups.</description>

Abstract: We consider complete toric varieties $X$ such that a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ of the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(X)$ acts on $X$ with an open orbit. It turns out that such varieties can be characterized by several remarkable properties. We study the set of Demazure roots of the corresponding complete fan, describe the structure of a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in $\text{Aut}(X)$, and find all regular subgroups in $U$ that act on $X$ with an open orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of multiview varieties as closures of images obtained by projecting subspaces of a given dimension onto several views, from the photographic and geometric points of view. Motivated by applications in Computer Vision for triangulation of world features, we investigate when the associated projection map is generically injective; an essential requirement for successful triangulation. We give a complete characterization of this property by determining two formulae for the dimensions of these varieties. Similarly, we describe for which center arrangements calibration of camera parameters is possible. We explore when the multiview variety is naturally isomorphic to its associated blowup. In the case of generic centers, we give a precise formula for when this occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has an appendix, written by considers some algebraic surfaces that can deform to planar Zappatic stable surfaces with a unique singularity of type En. We prove that the Galois covers of these surfaces are all simply connected of general type, for n&gt;=4, and we give a formula for Chern numbers of such Galois covers. As an application, we prove that such surfaces do not exist for n&gt;30. Furthermore, Kollar improves the result to n&gt;9 in Appendix 5.</description>

      <title>Scattering Diagrams from Holomorphic Discs in Log Calabi-Yau Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct special Lagrangian fibrations for log Calabi-Yau surfaces, and scattering diagrams from Lagrangian Floer theory of the fibres. Then we prove that the scattering diagrams recover the scattering diagrams of Gross-Pandharipande-Siebert and the canonical scattering diagrams of Gross-Hacking-Keel. With an additional assumption on the non-negativity of boundary divisors, we compute the disc potentials of the Lagrangian torus fibres via a holomorphic/tropical correspondence. As an application, we provide a version of mirror symmetry for rank two cluster varieties.</description>

      <title>Oka-1 manifolds: New examples and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Oka-1 manifolds and Oka-1 maps, a class of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps recently introduced by Alarc\'on and Forstneri\v{c}. Oka-1 manifolds are characterised by the property that holomorphic maps from any open Riemann surface to the manifold satisfy the Runge approximation and Weierstrass interpolation conditions, while Oka-1 maps enjoy similar properties for liftings of maps from open Riemann surfaces in the absence of topological obstructions. We also formulate and study the algebraic version of the Oka-1 condition, called aOka-1. We show that it is a birational invariant for projective manifolds and holds for all uniformly rational projective manifolds. This gives a Runge approximation theorem for maps from compact Riemann surfaces to uniformly rational projective manifolds. Finally, we study a class of complex manifolds with an approximation property for holomorphic sprays of discs. This class lies between the smaller class of Oka manifolds and the bigger class of Oka-1 manifolds and has interesting functorial properties.</description>
