      <title>Revealing Hidden Cosmic Flows through the Zone of Avoidance with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a refined deep-learning-based method to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density, gravitational potential, and peculiar velocity fields in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), a region near the galactic plane with limited observational data. Using a convolutional neural network (V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or potential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full 3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We validate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's significant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet account for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our results demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy clusters detected in an H \textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset not being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential of our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably, streamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration consistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\circ \pm 2.4^\circ, 29.0^\circ \pm 1.9^\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \pm 404.4,{\rm km/s}$, for 64\% of realizations. Our method is particularly valuable as it does not rely on data point density, enabling accurate reconstruction in data-sparse regions and offering strong potential for future surveys with more extensive galaxy datasets.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.</description>

      <title>Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN - CosmicANNEstimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmological Constraints of the Void-Lensing Cross-Correlation in the CSST Photometric Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological constraints from the void-lensing cross-correlation assuming the $w$CDM model for the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Using Jiutian simulations, we construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ approach to account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model (HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. I. Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at $z\sim 25-10$) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\sim 10^6 \Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\sim 10^8 \Msun)$. Using a simple $\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are $\sim10^4$ times faster than the Neadler-Mead $\chi^2$ minimization method used in \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We further identify six {\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across redshifts $z \sim 9$ to $z \sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.</description>

      <title>NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravity with the decay rate of cosmological gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key task in cosmology is to test the validity of general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales and, therefore, to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity (MG) as the driver of the late-time cosmic acceleration. The decay rate ($DR$) of cosmological gravitational potential, being sensitive to gravity and being immune to various astrophysical uncertainties, enables GR tests independent to other structure growth probes. Recently we have measured $DR$ at $0.2\leq z\leq 1.4$, combining the DR9 galaxy catalog from the DESI imaging surveys and Planck cosmic microwave background maps \citep{arXiv:2411.12594}. Here we use this measurement to test gravity, and restrict the analysis to one-parameter extensions to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We consider four one-parameter MG parameterizations. One is $f(a)=\Omega_m^\gamma(a)$. The other three adopt the gravitational slip parameter $\eta=1$ and consider variations in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}/G$ with the parameterization $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_\Lambda \Omega_\Lambda(a)/\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_1 a$ or $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_2 a^2$. We find $\gamma=0.47^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, consistent with the GR prediction $\gamma\simeq 0.55$. We also find $\Sigma_\Lambda=0.018^{+0.052}_{-0.053}$, $\Sigma_1=0.020^{+0.065}_{-0.062}$, and $\Sigma_2=0.027^{+0.067}_{-0.069}$, fully consistent with the GR case of $\Sigma=0$, regardless of parameterizations of $\Sigma(a)$. The constraining power is already competitive, while a factor of 2 further improvement is expected for the upcoming full-sky galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing Noise Covariance in Maximum-Likelihood Component Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a noise-aware extension to the parametric maximum-likelihood framework for component separation by modeling correlated $1/f^\alpha$ noise as a harmonic-space power law. This approach addresses a key limitation of existing implementations, for which a mismodelling of the statistical properties of the noise can lead to biases in the characterization of the spectral laws, and consequently biases in the recovered CMB maps. We propose a novel framework based on a modified ridge likelihood embedded in an ensemble-average pipeline and derive an analytic bias correction to control noise-induced foreground residuals. We discuss the practical applications of this approach in the absence of true noise information, leading to the choice of white noise as a realistic assumption. As a proof of concept, we apply this methodology to a set of simplified, idealized simulations inspired by the specifications of the proposed ECHO (CMB-Bh$\overline{a}$rat) mission, which features multi-frequency, large-format focal planes. We forecast the $95 \%$ upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{95}$, under a suite of realistic noise scenarios. Our results show that for an optimistic full sky observation, ECHO can achieve $r_{95}\leq 10^{-4}$ even in the presence of significant correlated noise, demonstrating the mission's capability to probe primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Without degrading the statistical performance of the traditional component separation, this methodology offers a robust path toward next-generation B-mode searches and informs instrument design by quantifying the impact of noise correlations on cosmological parameter recovery.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Grid of Nested Sampling Chains for Cosmological Model Comparison and Tension Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology, yet comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification remain computationally prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we release $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains. We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models, including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions, and 39 datasets, including individual probes and their pairwise combinations. Our model comparison reveals that whilst individual datasets show varied preferences for model extensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM model is most frequently preferred in combined analyses, with the general trend suggesting that evidence for new physics is diluted when probes are combined. Using five complementary statistics, we quantify tensions, finding the most significant to be between DES and Planck (3.57$\sigma$) and SH0ES and Planck (3.27$\sigma$) within $\Lambda$CDM. We characterise the $S_8$ tension as high-dimensional ($d_G=6.62$) and resolvable in extended models, whereas the Hubble tension is low-dimensional and persists across the model space. Caution should be exercised when combining datasets in tension. The $\texttt{unimpeded}$ data products, hosted on Zenodo, provide a powerful resource for reproducible cosmological analysis and underscore the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model against the current compendium of data.</description>

      <title>KGB-evolution: a relativistic $N$-body code for kinetic gravity braiding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present KGB-evolution, a relativistic $N$-body simulation code that extends the $k$-evolution code by incorporating an effective field theory parameterization of kinetic gravity braiding, while also including the $k$-essence model as a limiting case. As a first step, we implement the linearized dark energy stress-energy tensor and scalar field equations, providing the groundwork for a future full Horndeski theory extension. We validate KGB-evolution by comparing its power spectra against linear predictions from hi$\_$class, finding excellent agreement on large scales at low redshifts and over all scales at high redshifts. We demonstrate that nonlinear growth of matter and metric perturbations on small scales drives the linearized dark energy field into a nonlinear clustering regime, which in turn feeds back on the growth of cosmic structure. In contrast to the $k$-essence limit, a nonzero braiding considerably amplifies this backreaction, producing a significantly stronger alteration of structure formation in the kinetic gravity braiding model.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: Simulation-based $w$CDM inference from weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps with deep learning. I. Analysis design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Boson Stars Hosting Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center. We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star. Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.</description>

      <title>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. X: Formation and Evolution of Galaxies at the High-redshift Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

Abstract: The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 5.6 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrisation do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 25\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} &gt; \max[105 M_\odot/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_\odot)^{-0.09}]$ of DM.</description>

      <title>Testing scalar dark matter clumps with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \gtrsim 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\rm eV}\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ for $\Delta t$ smaller than one hour. However, for these high scalar masses only very high density dark matter clouds could be detected and the capture rate of neutron stars is too low to provide sufficient statistics. Significant detection probabilities would thus require direct dark-matter-baryon interactions that favor the formation of neutron stars within such dark matter clouds, or the discovery of black hole/pulsar binary systems, taking advantage of the dark matter spike generated by the black hole.</description>

We fit $f\sigma_8(z)$ to data from redshift-space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ using the dynesty implementation of nested sampling. Four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, and a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying the Anderson--Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. We obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}\}}$ and ${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$ for the coasting models and $\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\sigma_{8}(z=0)= 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}$ for $\Lambda$CDM. All models are consistent with the data, though the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly favored over the coasting models, with $\log$-Bayes factors of $\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{1.79,\, 1.55,\,1.42\}$. A predictive performance metric and posterior predictive check confirmed that while $\Lambda$CDM achieves the highest predictive accuracy, it also shows the strongest indication of overfitting. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion for $z&lt;2$. The curve fitting yielded ${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$ for the coasting models, resulting in $\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{2.12\sigma,\,1.21\sigma,\,0.62\sigma\}$ discrepancies with the standard Planck 2018 value. The tension level was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, for which $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>The validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</description>

      <title>Measuring the splashback feature: Dependence on halo properties and history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\mathcal{D}$ and width $\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as ``effective standard deviation'', and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II. Rotational Halo Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.</description>

      <title>The cosmological analysis of DES 3$\times$2pt data from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. Our results are consistent at the $\sim 1.5-2\sigma$ level with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, as well as with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior and a Planck prior on $n_s$. The shift in the posterior compared to DES collaboration results highlights the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Descriptive Parametric Model: Gaseous Profiles for Galaxies, Groups, and Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and present the Descriptive Parametric Model (DPM), a tool for generating profiles of gaseous halos (pressure, electron density, and metallicity) as functions of radius, halo mass, and redshift. The model assumes single-phase, spherically symmetric, volume-filling warm/hot gas. The DPM framework enables mock observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), group halos, and clusters across a number of wavebands including X-ray, sub-millimeter/millimeter, radio, and ultraviolet (UV). We introduce three model families calibrated to reproduce cluster profiles while having different extrapolations to the CGM -- (i) self-similar halos, (ii) a reduced gas model for lower halo masses, and (iii) a model with shallower radial slopes at lower masses. We demonstrate how our z=0.0-0.6 models perform when applied to stacked and individual X-ray emission profiles, measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect, electron dispersion measures from fast radio bursts, O VI absorption, and UV-derived pressures. Our investigation supports models that remove baryons from halos more effectively and have shallower profiles at lower halo mass. We discuss biases and systematics when modelling observables using consistent hot gaseous halo models for all wavebands explored. We release the DPMhalo code to encourage the use of our framework and new formulations in future investigations. Included with the DPMhalo distribution is a set of recent observations that allow the reproduction of most plots in this paper.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\mu m$, WISE 12$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The average far-infrared properties of Euclid-selected star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\rm e}^{-t/\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\pm0.1$K, and $\tau=1.6\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for &gt;60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.</description>
