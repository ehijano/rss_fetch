      <title>Elliptic orthogonal polynomials and OPRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of meromorphic functions on elliptic curves, termed \emph{elliptic orthogonal a-polynomials} ($a$-EOPs), which extend the classical notion of orthogonal polynomials to compact Riemann surfaces of genus one. Building on Bertola's construction of orthogonal sections, we study these functions via non-Hermitian orthogonality on the torus, establish their recurrence properties, and derive an analogue of the Christoffel--Darboux formula. We demonstrate that, under real-valued orthogonality conditions, $a$-EOPs exhibit interlacing and simplicity of zeros similar to orthogonal polynomials on the real line (OPRL). Furthermore, we construct a general correspondence between families of OPRL and elliptic orthogonal functions, including a decomposition into multiple orthogonality relations, and identify new interlacing phenomena induced by rational deformations of the orthogonality weight.</description>

      <title>A Bombieri-type inequality and equidistribution of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Etayo introduces a new Bombieri-type inequality for monic polynomials. Here we reinterpret this new inequality as a more general integral inequality involving the Green function for the sphere. This rather geometric interpretation allows for generalizations of the basic inequality, involving fractional zeros while also opening up the possibility to extend the setting to general compact Riemann surfaces. We derive a sharp form of these generalized Bombieri-type inequalities for the case of the sphere and the torus. These inequalities involve a quantity we call the packing number, which in turn is inspired by the geometric zero packing problems considered by Hedenmalm in the context of the asymptotic variance of the Bergman projection of a bounded function. As for the torus, we introduce analogs of polynomials (pseudopolynomials) based on the classical Weierstrass $\sigma$ function, and we explain how such pseudopolynomials fit in with the extended geometric Bombieri-type inequality. The sharpness of the packing number bound on the torus involves the construction of a lattice configuration on the torus for any given integer number of points. The corresponding bound for the sphere instead relies on the existence of well-conditioned polynomials in the sense of Shub and Smale.</description>

      <title>Potential Theory and the Boundary of Combinatorial Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite, connected graph. We investigate a notion of boundary $\partial G \subseteq V$ and argue that it is well behaved from the point of view of potential theory. This is done by proving a number of discrete analogous of classical results for compact domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. These include (1) an analogue of P\'olya's result that a random walk in $\Omega$ typically hits the boundary $\partial \Omega$ within $\lesssim \mbox{diam}(\Omega)^2$ units of time, (2) an analogue of the Faber-Krahn inequality, (3) an analogue of the Hardy inequality, (4) an analogue of the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate, (5) a stability estimate for hot spots and (6) a Theorem of Bj\"orck stating that probability measures $\mu$ that maximize $\int_{\Omega \times \Omega} \|x-y\|^{\alpha} d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ are fully supported in the boundary.</description>

      <title>Medians, Oscillations, and Distance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a geometric characterization of the sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ so that the corresponding log-distance function $\log \text{dist}(\cdot, E)$ is in $BMO$ (or equivalently $\text{dist}(\cdot, E)^{-\alpha} \in A_\infty$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$), generalizing the $A_1$ characterization in the work by Anderson, Lehrb\"ack, Mudarra, and V\"ah\"akangas. The proof relies on a new median-value characterization of $BMO$: For a real-valued measurable function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and constants $0 &lt; s &lt; t &lt; 1$, \[\|f\|_{BMO} \approx_{s, t, n} \sup_{Q}[M_t(f, Q) - M_s(f, Q)]\] where $M_s(f, Q)$ denotes the $s$-median value of $f$ on $Q$. We apply our characterization to the study of Hardy-Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>Improved Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and Kr\"oger inequality and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide quantitative improvements to the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and the Kr\"oger inequality, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay of semi-uniformly stable operator semigroups with empty spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to quantify the decay rate of a semi-uniformly stable operator semigroup based on sole knowledge of its spectrum. More precisely, given an arbitrary positive function $r$ vanishing at $\infty$, we construct a Banach space $X$ and a bounded semigroup $ (T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ of operators on it whose infinitesimal generator $A$ has empty spectrum $\sigma(A)=\varnothing$, but for which, for some $x \in X$, $$\limsup_{t\to\infty} \frac{\|T(t)A^{-1}x\|_{X}}{r(t)}=\infty.$$</description>

      <title>Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Runge-Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a key property of numerical methods. The geometric properties of symmetric schemes make them an attractive option for integrating Hamiltonian systems, whilst their ability to exactly recover the initial condition without the need to store the entire solution trajectory makes them ideal for the efficient implementation of Neural ODEs. In this work, we present a Hopf algebraic approach to the study of symmetric B-series methods. We show that every B-series method can be written as the composition of a symmetric and "antisymmetric" component, and explore the structure of this decomposition for Runge-Kutta schemes. A major bottleneck of symmetric Runge-Kutta schemes is their implicit nature, which requires solving a nonlinear system at each step. By introducing a new set of order conditions which minimise the antisymmetric component of a scheme, we derive what we call Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes -- a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes with near-symmetric properties. We present examples of second-order EES schemes and demonstrate that, despite their low order, these schemes readily outperform higher-order explicit schemes such as RK4 and RK5, and achieve results comparable to implicit symmetric schemes at a significantly lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and some applications in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Principal Non-singularity of Fourier Matrices on $\mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z_q$ and $\mathbb Z_2^k \times \mathbb Z_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the $n\times n$ Fourier matrix (on cyclic groups $\mathbb Z_n$), a reknowned theorem of Chebotar\"ev asserts that all minors in $F_n$ for prime $n$ are non-zero. In this short note it is shown that (i) all principal minors in the Kronecker product $F_p\otimes F_q$ are non-vanishing (principal non-singularity) for distinct odd primes $p,q$ if $q$ is large enough and generates the multiplicative group $\mathbb Z_p^*$; (ii) the Fourier matrix on $\mathbb Z_2^k \times \mathbb Z_q$ is principally non-singular upon permutation (in particular, for $k=1$ the identity permutation suffices) for odd prime $q$ and $k=1,2,3$. The proof is just an exposition of existing techniques re-organized in a unified way. The result will have implications in combining Riesz bases of exponentials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative nonembeddability of groups of polynomial growth into uniformly convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and not virtually abelian finitely generated groups of polynomial growth do not quasi-isometrically embed into uniformly convex Banach spaces. We quantify this fact by showing that a ball of radius $r\ge 2$ in the aforementioned groups must incur bilipschitz distortion at least a constant multiple of $(\log r)^{1/q}$ into a $q(\ge 2)$-uniformly convex Banach space. This bound is sharp for the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces. We prove this by establishing ``vertical versus horizontal inequalities'' for functions from the aforementioned groups into uniformly convex spaces, using the vector-valued Littlewood--Paley--Stein theory approach of Lafforgue and Naor (2012). These inequalities are quantitative nonembeddability statements that any Lipschitz mapping from the aforementioned groups into a uniformly convex space quantitatively collapses along certain central subgroups.
  In the special case of mappings of Carnot groups into the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces, we prove that the quantitative collapse occurs on the commutator subgroup; this is in line with the qualitative Pansu--Semmes nonembeddability argument given by Cheeger and Kleiner (2006) and Lee and Naor (2006). We prove this by establishing a version of the classical Dorronsoro theorem on Carnot groups. Previously, in the setting of Heisenberg groups, F\"assler and Orponen (2019) established a one-sided Dorronsoro theorem with a restriction $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ on the range of exponents $\alpha$ of the Laplacian; this restriction does not appear in the commutative setting and is caused by their use of horizontal polynomials as approximants. We identify the correct class of approximant polynomials and prove the two-sided Dorronsoro theorem with the full range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$ of exponents in the general setting of Carnot groups, thus strengthening and extending the work of F\"assler and Orponen.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of solutions to multiple Lotka-Volterra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider some non-zero complex numbers $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$ and the associated classical Lotka-Volterra systems
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x' = a_i xy + b_i y \newline
  y' = c_i xy + d_i y \text{ .}
  \end{cases}
  \] We show that as long as $b_i \neq d_i$ for all $i$ and $\{ b_i, d_i\} \neq \{ b_j, d_j\}$ for $i \neq j$, any tuples $(x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)$ of pairwise distinct, non-degenerate solutions of these systems are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, meaning $\mathrm{trdeg}((x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)/\mathbb{C}) = 2m$. Our proof relies on extending recent work of Duan and Nagloo by showing strong minimality of these systems, as long as $b_i \neq d_i$. We also generalize a theorem of Brestovski which allows us to control algebraic relations using invariant volume forms. Finally, we completely classify all invariant algebraic curves in the non-strongly minimal, $b_i = d_i$ case by using machinery from geometric stability theory.</description>
