      <title>Perturbation theory, irrep truncations, and state preparation methods for quantum simulations of SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of QCD with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electroweak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is determined non-perturbatively with a precision of about $0.5\%-1.0\%$ in the range of temperatures between 3 GeV and 165 GeV. The computation is carried out by numerical simulations of the gauge theory discretized on the lattice. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The pressure and energy density are then determined by integrating the entropy density with respect to the temperature. The numerical data show a linear behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared, which points to the Stefan-Boltzmann limit at infinite temperature. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, containing non-perturbative contributions. This parametrization describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to 500 MeV.</description>

      <title>Collins-Soper Kernel and Reduced Soft Function in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function in lattice QCD, incorporating $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ matching corrections. The calculation relies on the evaluation of the quasi-transverse momentum-dependent wave function with asymmetric staple-shaped quark bilinear operators and four-point meson form factors. These quantities are computed non-perturbatively using two $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted-mass fermion ensembles with the same lattice spacing of $a=0.093$ fm: the first ensemble has a lattice size of $24^3 \times 48$ and a pion mass of 346 MeV; the second one has a lattice size of $32^3 \times 64$ and a pion mass of 261 MeV. The Collins-Soper kernel and the soft function are needed for the determination of the transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Multi-strangeness matter from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent and present new results on thermalization of nonabelian gauge theory obtained by exact numerical simulation of the real-time dynamics of $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We discuss: (1) tests confirming the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis; (2) the entanglement entropy of sublattices, including the Page curve, the transition from area to volume scaling with increasing energy of the eigenstate and its time evolution that shows thermalization of localized regions to be a two-step process; (3) the absence of quantum many-body scars when higher gauge field representations are taken into account; (4) the spectral form factor, which exhibits the expected slope-ramp-plateau structure for late times; (5) the entanglement Hamiltonian for SU(2), which has properties in accordance with the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem; and (6) a measure for non-stabilizerness or ``magic'' that is found to reach its maximum during thermalization. We conclude that the thermalization of nonabelian gauge theories is a promising process to establish quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of $cc\bar u\bar s$ tetraquark channel in $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of coupled $DD_s^*$ and $D^*D_s$ scattering amplitudes in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ channel and elastic $DD_s$ scattering amplitude in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel. The aim is to investigate whether tetraquarks with flavor $cc\bar u\bar s$ exist in the region near threshold. Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\pi} \sim 280$ MeV, $a\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra are determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices, computed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures within the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$ is determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames following L\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of Lippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We observe small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the noninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather weak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero energy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry signatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy region near the threshold.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz formulas for finite-density Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>
