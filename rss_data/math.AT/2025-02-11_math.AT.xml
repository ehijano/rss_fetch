      <title>Homotopy Types of Small Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We algorithmically compute integral Eilenberg-MacLane homology of all semigroups of order at most $8$ and present some particular semigroups with notable classifying spaces, refuting conjectures of Nico. Along the way, we give an alternative topological proof of the fact that if a finite semigroup $S$ has a left-simple or right-simple minimal ideal $K(S)$, then the classifying space $BS$ is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space $B(GS)$ of the group completion. We also describe an algorithm for computing the group completion $GS$ of a finite semigroup $S$ using asymptotically fewer than $|S|^2$ semigroup operations. Finally, we show that the set of homotopy types of classifying spaces of finite monoids is closed under suspension.</description>

      <title>Boundary framings for locally conformally symmetric four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a rational homotopy-theoretic model for a classifying space of locally conformally symplectic structures on four-manifolds, and use it to definition a cobordism category of three-manifolds `anchored' by principal $\Omega^2 S^2$ - bundles (\S 2, generalizing contact structures). Powerful sl_2 - representation-valued Hodge-Lefschetz cohomology (going back to Chern and Weil), taking values in the \Z-graded category of bidifferential modules of Angella, Otiman, and Tardini is available for its study.
  \noindent \S3 observes that Ebin's configuration groupoid [Metrics/Dif] for Euclidean general relativity can be represented (cohomologically over $\Q$) in terms of a category of objects (or `aspects') of $X$ (as a space, under the action of its group of (pointed, etc) diffeomorphisms). This provides a notational system for the higher category of actions of compact connected groups $K$ on $X$, which is classically accessible by Atiyah-Bott/Duistermaat-Heckmann localisation.</description>

      <title>Rational SU(3)-equivariant cohomology theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the spectral space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of SU(3), together with the additional structure of a sheaf of rings and a component structure. It is a disjoint union of 18 blocks each dominated by a subgroup. For each of these blocks we identify a sheaf of rings and component structure. Taken together, this gives an abelian category A(SU(3)) designed to reflect the structure of rational SU(3)-equivariant cohomology theories, and we assemble the results from elsewhere to show that the category of rational SU(3)-spectra is Quillen equivalent to the category of differential graded objects of A(SU(3)).</description>

      <title>Cohomology of classifying spaces of rank 3 Kac-Moody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent the rational and mod $p$ cohomology groups of classifying spaces of rank 3 Kac-Moody groups by a direct sum of the invariants of Weyl groups and their quotients. As an application, the authors conclude that there is a $p$-torsion for each prime $p$ in the integral cohomology groups of classifying spaces of rank 3 Kac-Moody groups. We also determine the ring structure of the rational cohomology with one exception case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the Kashiwara--Vergne groups and associators in higher genera, introduced in Alekseev--Kawazumi--Kuno--Naef, in terms of non-commutative connections using the tools developed in a previous paper. As the main result, the case of closed surfaces is dealt with to determine the pro-nilpotent automorphism group of the associated graded of the Goldman--Turaev Lie bialgebra.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the cancellation of a critical pair on the (co-)boundary operator in discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Morse theory helps us compute the homology groups of simplicial complexes in an efficient manner. A "good" gradient vector field reduces the number of critical simplices, simplifying homology calculations by reducing them to the computation of homology groups of a simpler chain complex. This homology computation hinges on an efficient enumeration of gradient trajectories. The technique of cancelling pairs of critical simplices reduces the number of critical simplices, though it also perturbs the gradient trajectories. In this article, we provide an explicit formula for computing the modified boundary operators after cancelling a critical pair, in terms of the original boundary operators. Thus, it eliminates the need of enumeration of the new gradient trajectories.</description>

      <title>String topology on the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we consider algebraic structures on the homology of the space of paths in a manifold with endpoints in a submanifold. The Pontryagin-Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of this space had already been investigated by Hingston and Oancea for a particular example. We consider this product as a special case of a more general construction where we consider pullbacks of the path space of a manifold under arbitrary maps. The product on the homology of this space as well as the module structure over the Chas-Sullivan ring are shown to be invariant under homotopies of the respective maps. This in particular implies that the Pontryagin-Chas-Sullivan product as well as the module structure on the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold are isomorphic for two homotopic embeddings of the submanifold. Moreover, for null-homotopic embeddings of the submanifold this yields nice formulas which we can be used to compute the product and the module structure explicitly. We show that in the case of a null-homotopic embedding the homology of the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold is even an algebra over the Chas-Sullivan ring.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>

      <title>Atiyah-Bott localization in equivariant Witt cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13882v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a normalizer of the diagonal torus $T_1\cong \mathbb{G}_m$ in $\text{SL}_2$. We prove localization theorems for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N^n$ for equivariant cohomology with coefficients in the (twisted) Witt sheaf, along the lines of the classical Atiyah-Bott localization theorems for equivariant cohomology for a torus action. We also have an analog of the Bott residue formula for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N$. In the case of an $\text{SL}_2^n$-action, there is a rather serious restriction on the orbit type. For an $N$-action, there is no restriction for the localization result, but for the Bott residue theorem, one requires a certain type of decomposition of the fixed points for the $T_1$-action.</description>

      <title>Shuffle series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply operad theory to enumerative combinatorics in order to count the number of shuffles between series-parallel posets and chains. We work with three types of shuffles, two of them noncommutative, for example a left deck-divider shuffle $A$ between $P$ and $Q$ is a shuffle of the posets in which, on every maximal chain $m\subset A$, the minimum and maximum elements belong to $P$ and no two consecutive points of $Q$ appear consecutively on $m$. The number of left deck-divider shuffles of $P$ and $Q$ differ from the number of left deck-divider shuffles of $Q$ and $P$.
  The generating functions whose $n$ coefficient counts shuffles between a poset $P$ and $1&lt;2&lt;\cdots&lt;n$ are called shuffle series. We explain how shuffle series are isomorphic to order series as algebras over the operad of series parallel posets.
  The weak and strict order polynomials are well known in the literature. At the level of generating series, with the theory of sets with a negative number of elements, we introduce a third order series and prove a theorem in the style of Stanley's Reciprocity Theorem compatible with the structure of algebras over the operad of finite posets.
  We conclude by describing the relationship of our work with the combinatorial properties of the operadic tensor product of free trees operads.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of inverse limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.</description>
