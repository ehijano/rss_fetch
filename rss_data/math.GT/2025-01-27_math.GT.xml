      <title>On transverse $R$-covered minimal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimal transverse foliations which are $R$-covered. If in addition the dimension of the ambient manifold is $3$, and the foliations are Anosov foliations we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the intersected foliation to be the orbit foliation of an Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>Connection points on double regular polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study connection points on the double regular $n$-gon translation surface, for $n \geq 7$ odd and its staircase model. For $n \neq 9$, we provide a large family of points with coordinates in the trace field that are not connection points. This family includes the central points, and for $n=7$ we conjecture that all the remaining points are connection points. Further, in the case where $n \geq 7$ is a prime number, we provide a constructive proof by exhibiting an explicit separatrix passing through a central point that does not extend to a saddle connection.</description>

      <title>Low rank matrix completion and realization of graphs: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Netflix problem (from machine learning) asks the following. Given a ratings matrix in which each entry $(i,j)$ represents the rating of movie $j$ by customer $i$, if customer $i$ has watched movie $j$, and is otherwise missing, we would like to predict the remaining entries in order to make good recommendations to customers on what to watch next. The remaining entries are predicted so as to minimize the {\it rank} of the completed matrix.
  In this survey we study a more general problem, in which instead of knowing specific matrix elements, we know linear relations on such elements. We describe applications of these results to embeddings of graphs in surfaces (more precisely, embeddings with rotation systems, and embeddings modulo 2).</description>

      <title>Horocycles in hyperbolic 3-manifolds with round Sierpi\'nski limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let M be a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold whose limit set is a round Sierpi\'nski carpet, i.e. M is geometrically finite and acylindrical with a compact, totally geodesic convex core boundary. In this paper, we classify orbit closures of the 1-dimensional horocycle flow on the frame bundle of M. As a result, the closure of a horocycle in M is a properly immersed submanifold. This extends the work of McMullen-Mohammadi-Oh where M is further assumed to be convex cocompact.</description>

      <title>Exotic proper actions on homogeneous spaces via convex cocompact representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a series of homogeneous spaces G/H of reductive type which admit proper actions of discrete subgroups of G isomorphic to cocompact lattices of O(n,1) (n=2,3,4) but do not admit proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups of G. The existence of such homogeneous spaces was previously not known even for n=2. Our construction of proper actions of discrete subgroups is based on Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on convex cocompact subgroups of O(n,1) and Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on right-angled Coxeter groups. On the other hand, the non-existence of proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups is proved by the theory of nilpotent orbits and elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Clasper Concordance, Whitney towers and repeating Milnor invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, a link $L\subset S^3$ bounds a degree $k$ Whitney tower in the 4-ball if and only if it is \emph{$C_k$-concordant} to the unlink. This means that $L$ is obtained from the unlink by a finite sequence of concordances and degree $k$ clasper surgeries. In our construction the trees associated to the Whitney towers coincide with the trees associated to the claspers.
  As a corollary to our previous obstruction theory for Whitney towers in the 4-ball, it follows that the $C_k$-concordance filtration of links is classified in terms of Milnor invariants, higher-order Sato-Levine and Arf invariants.
  Using a new notion of $k$-repeating twisted Whitney towers, we also classify a natural generalization of the notion of link homotopy, called twisted \emph{self $C_k$-concordance}, in terms of $k$-repeating Milnor invariants and $k$-repeating Arf invariants.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of non-Euclidean Mass Center System and Generalized Pappus' Centroid Theorems in Three Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G.A. Galperin introduced the axiomatic mass center system for finite point sets in spherical and hyperbolic spaces, proving the uniqueness of the mass center system. In this paper, we revisit this system and provide a significantly simpler proof of its uniqueness. Furthermore, we extend the axiomatic mass center system to manifolds. As an application of our system, we derive a highly generalized version of Pappus' centroid theorem for volumes in three geometries - Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic - across all dimensions, offering unified and notably simple proofs for all three geometries.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology.
  We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence.
  Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a real Lie group and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$. Is $\Gamma$ residually finite? This paper describes known positive and negative results then poses some questions whose answers will lead to a fairly complete answer for lattices.</description>
