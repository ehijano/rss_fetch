      <title>The local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, which are influenced by Young-Pil Choi, Bongsuk Kwon [London Mathematical Society 28 (2015), pp. 3309-3336]\cite{12L}. As for the global well-posedness of the solution of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, this paper first linearizes the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, constructs the approximate solution of the linearized equation, and obtains the consistent estimation of the approximate solution. Then, the approximate solution is limited. The local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations are obtained, which further enriches the existence results of strong solutions for Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the intermediate nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of intermediate nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (INLS) on the real line, which includes the continuum Calogero-Moser models (CCM). We prove that INLS is locally well-posed in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $s&gt;\frac 14$, which improves upon the previous best result of $s&gt;\frac 12$ by de Moura-Pilod (2008). This result is also new in the special case of CCM, as the initial condition is not required to lie in any Hardy space. Our approach is based on a gauge transformation, exploiting the remarkable structure of the nonlinearity together with bilinear Strichartz estimates, which allows to recover some of the derivative loss. This turns out to be sufficient to establish our main results for CCM in the Hardy space. For INLS and CCM outside of the Hardy space, the main difficulty comes from the lack of the Hardy space assumption, which we overcome by implementing a refined decomposition of the solutions, which observes a nonlinear smoothing effect in part of the solution. We also discover a new Lax pair for INLS and use it to establish global well-posedness in $H^{s}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $s&gt;\frac 14$ under the additional assumption of small $L^2$-norm.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a nonlinear free-boundary tumor model with three layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinear free boundary problem modeling the growth of spherically symmetric tumors. The tumor consists of a central necrotic core, an intermediate annual quiescent-cell layer, and an outer proliferating-cell layer. The evolution of tumor layers and the movement of the tumor boundary are totally governed by external nutrient supply and conservation of mass. The three-layer structure generates three free boundaries with boundary conditions of different types. We develop a nonlinear analysis method to get over the great difficulty arising from free boundaries and the discontinuity of the nutrient-consumption rate function. By carefully studying the mutual relationships between the free boundaries, we reveal the evolutionary mechanism in tumor growth and the mutual transformation of its internal structures. The existence and uniqueness of the radial stationary solution is proved, and its globally asymptotic stability towards different dormant tumor states is established.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on R^3. Two monotonicity conjectures for solitons posed by Killip, Oh, Pocovnicu and Visan are completely resolved: one concerning frequency monotonicity, and the other concerning mass monotonicity. Uniqueness of the energy minimizer is proved. Then sharp stability of the solitons is established. And classification of normalized solutions is first presented.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions and incompressible limit to the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in 2D bounded domains with ripped density and large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work (arXiv:2510.00812), we have shown the global existence and incompressible limit of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations involving ripped density and large initial energy in the whole plane. In this paper we generalize such results to the case of two-dimensional bounded convex domains under Navier-slip boundary conditions. When comparing to the known results for global solutions of the initial-boundary value problem, we obtain uniform a priori estimates independent of the bulk viscosity coefficient.</description>

      <title>Existence results for a biofilm free-boundary problem with dominant detachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wanner-Gujer free boundary problem modeling biofilms with a prevailing detachment. This result extends the some works from tumor gowth modeling as well as those from the biofilm modeling field. Besides the local existence and uniqueness, the continuous dependence on initial and boundary data and the global existence is also given. The local existence is obtained by using fixed point arguments combined with semigroup theory while the global existence is deduced using invariance regions and energy estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of normalized ground states for the Hartree equation with a harmonic potential are addressed. The existence of normalized ground state for any prescribed mass is confirmed according to mass-energy constrained variational approach. The uniqueness is shown by the strictly convex properties of the energy functional. Moreover, the orbital stability of every normalized ground state is proven in terms of the Cazenave and Lions' argument.</description>

      <title>Doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger normalized ground states on 2D grids: existence results and singular limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the singular limit of normalized ground states for focusing doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with both standard and concentrated nonlinearities on two-dimensional square grids. First, we provide existence and non-existence results for such ground states depending on the values of the nonlinearity powers and on the structure of the set of vertices where the concentrated nonlinearities are located. Second, we prove that suitable piecewise-affine extensions of such states converge strongly in $H^1(\R^2)$ to ground states of corresponding doubly nonlinear models defined on the whole plane as the length of the edges in the grid tends to zero. This convergence is proved both for limit models with standard nonlinearities only and for models combining standard and singular nonlinearities concentrated on a line or on a strip.</description>

      <title>Linear decay of the beta-plane equation near Couette flow on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new time decay estimates for the linearized $\beta$-plane equation near the Couette flow on the plane that combine inviscid damping and the dispersion of Rossby waves. Specifically, we show that the profiles of the velocity field components (i.e. $u(t,x+ty,y)$) decay pointwise on any compact set with polynomial rates. While mixing dominates for streamwise frequencies that are $O(1)$, dispersive effects need to be extracted for low streamwise frequencies that appear along a critical ray in frequency space. Our proof entails the analysis of oscillatory integrals with homogeneous phase and multipliers that diverge in the infinite time limit. To handle this singular limit, we prove a Van der Corput type estimate, followed by two delicate asymptotic analyses of the phase and multipliers: one that is of ``boundary layer" type, featuring sharp gradients that grow in $t$ across the critical ray, and one that is of ``multi-scale" type, which extracts a governing analytic profile function for the phase.</description>

      <title>Similarity Solutions of Shock Formation for First-order Strictly Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks due to hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear throughout mathematics and science. The canonical example is shock formation in the inviscid Burgers' equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$. Previous studies have shown that when shocks form for the inviscid Burgers' equation, for positions and times close to the shock singularity, the dynamics are locally self-similar and universal, i.e., dynamics are equivalent regardless of the initial conditions. In this paper, we show that, in fact, shock formation is self-similar and universal for general first-order strictly hyperbolic PDEs in one spatial dimension, and the self-similarity is like that of the inviscid Burgers' equation. An analytical formula is derived and verified for the self-similar universal solution.</description>

      <title>On taming Moffatt-Kimura vortices of doom in the viscous case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we propose a two-layer viscous mechanism for preventing finite time singularity formation in the Moffatt-Kimura model of two counter-rotating vortex rings colliding at a nontrivial angle. In the first layer the scenario is recast within the framework of the study of turbulent dissipation based on a suitably defined `scale of sparseness' of the regions of intense fluid activity. Here it is found that the problem is (at worst) critical, i.e., the upper bound on the scale of sparseness of the vorticity super-level sets is comparable to the lower bound on the radius of spatial analyticity. In the second layer, an additional more subtle mechanism is identified, potentially capable of driving the scale of sparseness into the dissipation range and preventing the formation of a singularity. The mechanism originates in certain analytic cancellation properties of the vortex-stretching term in the sense of compensated compactness in Hardy spaces which then convert information on local mean oscillations of the vorticity direction (boundedness in certain log-composite weighted local bmo spaces) into log-composite faster decay of the vorticity super-level sets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic representation of solutions for the parabolic Cauchy problem with variable exponent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponents coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of generalized Chern-Simons equations on discrete lattice graphs and establish the existence of topological solutions. Using an iterative method starting from a trivial initial function and an associated energy functional, we construct a monotone decreasing sequence that converges to a solution on bounded domains. By deriving uniform estimates and passing to the limit over an increasing sequence of expanding domains, we obtain a global solution defined on the entire graph, which exhibits topological characteristics.</description>

      <title>Fractional Torsional Rigidity of Compact Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates fractional torsional rigidity on compact, connected metric graphs, a novel extension of the classical concept to nonlocal operators. The fractional torsional rigidity is defined as the $L^1$-norm of the fractional torsion function, which is the unique solution to the boundary value problem $(-\Delta_{\mathcal{G}})^\alpha u_\alpha = 1$ on a graph $\mathcal{G}$ with zero boundary conditions at Dirichlet vertices. We establish a variational characterization for this quantity, which serves as a powerful tool to prove a series of results on its geometric dependence. By applying surgery principles, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds, indicating that the interval serves as an upper comparison case and the flower graph as a lower one among graphs of fixed total length. These findings mirror the classical case, yet the methods required are substantially different due to the nonlocal nature of the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On a gradient term for a class of second-order PDEs and applications to the infinity Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a natural gradient term for a class of second-order partial differential equations of the form \begin{equation}\nonumber
  M(x,Du,D^2u)+g(u)N(x,Du, D^2u)+f(x,u)=0 \;\;\mbox{in}\;\; \Omega, \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set, $f\in C(\Omega\times \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$, $M$ defines the partial differential operator, $N$ is a quadratic term driven by the gradient $Du$ and $M$ itself, and $g\in C(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$. We establish conditions on the class of operators $M$ for the existence of a change of variables $v = \Phi(u)$ that transforms the previous equation into another one of the form \begin{equation}\nonumber
  M(x,Dv, D^2v) + h(x,v)=0 \quad \text{in} \;\; \Omega \end{equation} which does not depend on the quadratic term $N$. The results presented here unify previous findings for the Laplacian, $m$-Laplacian, and $k$-Hessian operators, which were derived separately by different authors and are restricted to $C^2$ solutions with fixed sign. Our work provides a more general framework, extending these findings to a broader class of nonlinear partial differential equations, including the infinity-Laplacian o\-pe\-ra\-tor. In addition, we also include both $C^2$ and viscosity solutions that may change sign. As an application, we also obtain an Aronsson-type result and investigate viscosity solutions for the Dirichlet problem associated with the infinity Laplace equation with its natural gradient term.</description>

      <title>Large torus limit of global dynamics of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Regularity for a strongly degenerate equation with explicit $u$-dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider local weak solutions of widely degenerate elliptic PDEs of the type \begin{equation}
  \label{equazione mia}
  \mathrm{div}\Biggl(a(x)(|Du|-1)^{p-1}_+\frac{Du}{|Du|}\Biggr)=b(x,u) \ \ \text{ in }\Omega,
  \end{equation} where $2\leq p&lt;\infty,\textbf{ } \Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n,n&gt;2,$ and $( \ \cdot \ )_+$ stands for the positive part. We establish a higher differentiability result for the composition of the gradient with a suitable function that vanishes in the unit ball for the gradient, under suitable assumptions on the datum $b(x,u)$ and the coefficient $a(x).$ The novelty here with respect to previous papers on the subject is that the right hand side explicitly depends on the solution $u.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudodifferential Volterra calculus for inverting parabolic differential equations on Lie groupoids is introduced. This enables the study of fundamental solutions of various cases of heat flows on singular manifolds with corners with non-resonant boundary indicial symbols, such as the $b$-manifolds, as well as other geometric bisection covariant heat flows. We also establish the short time asymptotic expansion for the heat kernel of a positive, elliptic differential operator on a Lie groupoid that acts on suitable Sobolev Hilbert modules and is positive definite with respect to the appropriate $L^2$ inner product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for constructing local-in-time solutions the incompressible Euler equations in Sobolev spaces on an arbitrary Sobolev bounded domain. The method is based on construction of an analytic solution in an analytically approximated domain, after which we apply analytic persistence to extend the analytic solution given a priori bounds in Sobolev spaces. The method does not introduce any modification or regularization of the equations themselves and appears applicable to many other PDEs.</description>

      <title>Boundary estimates for a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet boundary value problem for fully nonlinear Yamabe equations on Riemannian manifolds with boundary. Assuming the existence of a subsolution, we derive \emph{a priori} boundary second derivative estimates and consequently obtain the existence of a smooth solution. Moreover, with respect to a family of equations interpolating the fully nonlinear Yamabe equation and the classical semi-linear Yamabe equation, our estimates remain uniform. Finally, an example of a $C^1$ solution which is smooth in the interior but not smooth at the boundary is also given.</description>

      <title>Varifold convergence of free boundary Allen--Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free boundary Allen--Cahn equation $\Delta u=0$ in $\{|u|&lt;1\}$, $|\nabla u|=1/\varepsilon$ on $\partial\{|u|&lt;1\}$ has recently attracted considerable attention because it retains the essential features of the classical Allen--Cahn equation while being significantly more tractable. In this work, we establish the free boundary analogue of the seminal Hutchinson--Tonegawa theory, developing the varifold convergence framework for solutions of the free boundary Allen--Cahn equation to minimal surfaces. In addition, we provide the $\Gamma$-convergence of the free boundary Allen--Cahn energy to the area functional, and the conservation of local minimization property. This foundation is expected to be used in further applications of the free boundary Allen--Cahn equation in the study of minimal surfaces, such as providing an alternative proof of celebrated Yau's conjecture, possibly with simpler and more complete arguments.</description>

      <title>Global existence of weak solutions to a tissue regeneration model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cross-diffusion model for tissue regeneration which involves the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells interacting with chondrocytes in a medium containing a differentiation factor. The latter acts as a chemoattractant for the chondrocytes and influences the (de)differentiation of both cell phenotypes. The stem cells perform haptotaxis towards extracellular matrix expressed by the chondrocytes and degraded by themselves. Cartilage production as part of the extracellular matrix is ensured by condrocytes. The growth factor is provided periodically, to maintain the cell dynamics. We provide a proof for the global existence of weak solutions to this model, which is a simplified version of a more complex setting deduced in \cite{surulescu_AMM}.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a generalized Stokes operator on smooth bounded domains via layer-potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Sobolev-type inequality involving the $p$-curl operator in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove the existence of a minimizer which yields a solution to the $p$-curl-curl equation in the critical case. The problem is motivated both by nonlinear Maxwell equations and by the occurrence of zero modes in three-dimensional Dirac equations. Moreover, we introduce a new variational approach that allows to treat quasilinear strongly indefinite problems by direct minimization on a Nehari-type constraint. We also consider existence of minimizers under some symmetry assumptions. Finally, our approach offers a new proof of the compactness of minimizing sequences for the Sobolev inequalities in the critical case.</description>

      <title>Boundary and Interior Control in a Diffusive Lotka-Volterra Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the controllability of a generalized diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition model for two species, incorporating boundary controls and an interior multiplicative control. Considering a smooth, bounded N-dimensional domain, we analyze ecologically pertinent scenarios characterized by constraints on both the controls and system states. Our results demonstrate how integrated control strategies can effectively overcome the limitations identified in previous studies. We prove two main results: (1) asymptotic controllability to single-species survival steady states under arbitrary system parameters, ensured by a combination of boundary and interior controls which act jointly to stabilize the system; and (2) finite-time controllability to a specific heterogeneous coexistence steady state via a two-phase strategy - first steering the system near the target with boundary control, then activating an interior multiplicative control in a localized region. The strong synergy between the two control mechanisms is crucial in both cases. We also analyze extinction dynamics and homogeneous coexistence, and support our findings with numerical simulations. The work concludes with perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Gradient bounds for a widely degenerate orthotropic parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following nonlinear parabolic equation \[ \partial_{t}u\,=\,\sum_{i=1}^{n}\partial_{x_{i}}\left[(\vert u_{x_{i}}\vert-\delta_{i})_{+}^{p-1}\frac{u_{x_{i}}}{\vert u_{x_{i}}\vert}\right]\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{in}\,\,\,\Omega\times I, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded open interval, $p\geq2$, $\delta_{1},\ldots,\delta_{n}$ are non-negative numbers and $\left(\,\cdot\,\right)_{+}$ denotes the positive part. We prove that the local weak solutions are locally Lipschitz continuous in the spatial variable, uniformly in time. The main novelty here is that the above equation combines an orthotropic structure with a strongly degenerate behavior. We emphasize that our result can be considered, on the one hand, as the parabolic counterpart of the elliptic result established in [12], and on the other hand as an extension to a significantly more degenerate framework of the findings contained in [13].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the critical points of stable solutions for the following $p$-laplacian equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -div\big(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\big)=f(u)&amp;in\ \Om,\\ u&gt;0&amp;in\ \Om,\\ u=0&amp;on\ \partial\Om, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $p&gt;2$, $f\in C^1([0,+\infty))$ satisfies $f(t)&gt;0$ for $t&gt;0$, and $\Om\subset\R^2$ is a smooth bounded domain with non-negative curvature of the boundary. Via a suitable approximation argument, we prove that, a stable solution $u$ admits, as its only critical point, the internal absolute maxima and possibly saddle points with zero index. Moreover, $Argmax(u)$ is a point or segment.</description>

      <title>Classical Sobolev approach for a critical fourth-order Leray-Lions type problem: existence and multiplicity of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fourth-order elliptic problem of Leray-Lions type is considered for combined nonlinearities and Sobolev-critical growth with Navier and Dirichlet boundary conditions. By combining variational methods and critical point theory, the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions are established in the setting of classical Sobolev spaces. Two distinct asymptotic regimes are considered for the perturbation term: sublinear and superlinear. In the sublinear case, the existence of infinitely many solutions is proved by using topological tools such as Krasnosel'skii's genus and Clark's deformation lemma. In the superlinear case, the existence of at least one nontrivial solution is obtained via the Mountain Pass Theorem. Furthermore, the applicability of the main results is illustrated in the context of Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic walker model is proposed to describe the chemotactic guidance of growth cones, i.e. the tips of developing neurites. The model accounts for the influence of both attractive and repulsive chemical cues, which are emitted by the growth cones and the somas. The system couples stochastic differential equations governing the motion of the growth cones with reaction-diffusion equations that describe the dynamics of the chemical concentrations. The existence of a unique solution to this coupled system is proved. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the model to key biological parameters. The impact of the nonlocal regularization of point sources in the reaction-diffusion equations is analyzed in a simplified deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Inverse stability for hyperbolic equations with different initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Lipschitz stability recovery for both the potential and the initial conditions using a single boundary measurement in the context of a hyperbolic boundary initial value problem. In our setting, the initial conditions are allow to differ for different potentials. Compared to the traditional B-K method, our approach does not require the time reflection step. This advantage makes it possible to apply our method to the fixed angle inverse scattering problem with only a single incident wave which remains unresolved. To achieve our result, we impose certain pointwise positivity assumption on the difference of initial conditions. The assumption generalizes previous stability results that usually assume the difference to be zero. We propose the initial-potential problem and prove a potential inverse stable recovery result of it. The initial-potential problem plays as an attempt to relate initial boundary value problem with the scattering problem, and to explore the possibility to relax the positivity requirement on the initial data. We also establish a new pointwise Carleman estimate, whose proof is significantly shorter than traditional ones.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous optimal transport maps between oblique cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct homogeneous optimal transport maps for the quadratic cost between convex cones with homogeneous, possibly degenerate, densities when the cones satisfy an obliqueness condition. The existence of such maps plays a central role in the boundary regularity theory for optimal transport maps between convex domains. Our results are also relevant for the existence of complete Calabi-Yau metrics on certain quasi-projective varieties.</description>

      <title>Constrained hydrodynamic flocking models in the limit of large attraction-repulsion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective dynamics of a population of particles/organisms subject to self-consistent attraction-repulsion interactions and an external velocity field. The starting point of our analysis is a mean-field kinetic model and we investigate the singular limit corresponding to strong interaction forces. For well-prepared initial data, we show that the population asymptotically concentrates within a domain $\Omega(t)=\Omega_0+X(t)$ whose shape $\Omega_0$ is determined by the minimization of the interaction energy while the evolution of the domain's center of mass $X(t)$ is determined by the external force field. In addition, we show that the internal flow of organisms within this moving domain is described by a classical hydrodynamic model (the lake equation). The first part of our result relies only on the existence and uniqueness of minimizers for the interaction energy and holds for rather general interaction kernels. The second part is proved using a modulated energy method under more restrictive conditions on the nature of the interactions, and assuming that the limiting lake equation admits strong solutions.</description>

      <title>The Regularity of Critical Points to the Dirichlet Energy of the Mean Curvature in Dimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that weak immersions of four dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^5$ which are critical points to the Dirichlet Energy of the Mean Curvature are analytic in any given local harmonic chart. This variational problem is a model case for the large family of scaling invariant Lagrangians, hence critical, of curvature energies in 4 dimensions depending on the first and the second fundamental form. Because of the criticality of this variational problem, the regularity result is obtained through an abundant use of methods from integrability by compensation theory such as interpolation spaces estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove finite-time singularity formation for Lipschitz continuous solutions of the inviscid porous medium equation which vanish on the boundary of the domain. As the density vanishes on the boundary of the domain, the full regularizing effect of transport is present and must be overcome. The solutions are smooth away from the origin and the density can be made compactly supported.</description>

      <title>Gamma convergence for a phase-field cohesive energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducing the key features of fracture behavior under multiaxial stress states is essential for accurate modeling. Experimental evidence indicates that three intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic materials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength remains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but rather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this strength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges, especially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature often fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of experimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent work introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field framework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This model introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response. Notably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not interpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather as a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous variational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of variations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp cohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting, using a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong localization of the damage variable. Notably, unlike classical models where the elastic and fracture energies converge independently, this model exhibits a coupling of all energy terms. We also present numerical simulations exploring the sensitivity of the model to mesh anisotropy, offering insight into both its theoretical robustness and its practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Identities and inequalities for integral transforms involving squares of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an integral transform given by $T_{\nu} f(s) := \pi \int_0^\infty rs J_{\nu}(r s)^2 f(r) \, dr$, where $J_{\nu}$ denotes the Bessel function of the first kind of order $\nu$. As shown by Walther (2002, doi:10.1006/jfan.2001.3863), this transform plays an essential role in the study of optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$. On the other hand, Bez et al. (2015, doi:10.1016/j.aim.2015.08.025) studied these optimal constants using a different method, and obtained a certain alternative expression for $T_{\nu} f$ involving the $d$-dimensional Fourier transform of $x \mapsto f(\lvert x \rvert)$ when $\nu = k + d/2 - 1$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The aims of this paper are to extend their identity for non-integer indices and to derive several inequalities from it.</description>

      <title>SHAP values through General Fourier Representations: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the mathematical analysis of SHAP values. We show that any predictive model defined on a discrete or multi-valued input space admits a generalized Fourier expansion with respect to an orthonormalisation tensor-product basis constructed under a product probability measure. Within this setting, each SHAP attribution can be represented as a linear functional of the model's Fourier coefficients.
  Two complementary regimes are studied. In the deterministic regime, we derive quantitative stability estimates for SHAP values under Fourier truncation, showing that the attribution map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the distance between predictors. In the probabilistic regime, we consider neural networks in their infinite-width limit and prove convergence of SHAP values toward those induced by the corresponding Gaussian process prior, with explicit error bounds in expectation and with high probability based on concentration inequalities.
  We also provide a numerical experiment on a clinical unbalanced dataset to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse random source problem for elastic waves in three dimensions, where the source is assumed to be driven by an additive white noise. A novel computational method is proposed for reconstructing the variance of the random source from the correlation boundary measurement of the wave field. Compared with existing multi-frequency iterative approaches, our method is non-iterative and requires data at only a single frequency. As a result, the computational cost is significantly reduced. Furthermore, rigorous error analysis is conducted for the proposed method, which gives a quantitative error estimate. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, this method can to be directly applied to stochastic Maxwell equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of the volume preserving mean curvature flow (VPMCF) and area preserving mean curvature flow (APMCF) in the Schwarzschild space. We show that if the initial hypersurface is sufficiently close to a coordinate sphere, these flows exist globally in time and converge smoothly to a constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurface, namely a coordinate sphere. For asymptotically Schwarzschild space, if the initial hypersurface has pinched curvature outside of some large compact set, we will similar method combined with the center manifold analysis to see that the flow still exists for long time and converges to CMC hypersurface exponentially fast. This in particular gives an existence result for a CMC hypersurface in asymptotically flat space.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mild generative variant of the classical neural operator model, which leverages Kolmogorov--Arnold networks to solve infinite families of second-order backward stochastic differential equations ($2$BSDEs) on regular bounded Euclidean domains with random terminal time. Our first main result shows that the solution operator associated with a broad range of $2$BSDE families is approximable by appropriate neural operator models. We then identify a structured subclass of (infinite) families of $2$BSDEs whose neural operator approximation requires only a polynomial number of parameters in the reciprocal approximation rate, as opposed to the exponential requirement in general worst-case neural operator guarantees.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study elastic Brownian motion on a \(C^2\) domain. Instead of being killed at the boundary, the process restarts from a random position inside the domain. We characterize this process through its stochastic differential equation (SDE), its generator, and a description of the paths. We also derive the invariant probability measure and the spectral representation. At the end, we focus on the harmonic functions on the upper half-space to study the trace process.</description>

      <title>Blow-up in finite or infinite time of the 2D cubic Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.05121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that near-threshold negative energy solutions to the 2D cubic ($L^2$-critical) focusing Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation blow-up in finite or infinite time. The proof consists of several steps. First, we show that if the blow-up conclusion is false, there are negative energy solutions arbitrarily close to the threshold that are globally bounded in $H^1$ and are spatially localized, uniformly in time. In the second step, we show that such solutions must in fact be exact remodulations of the ground state, and hence, have zero energy, which is a contradiction. This second step, a nonlinear Liouville theorem, is proved by contradiction, with a limiting argument producing a nontrivial solution to a (linear) linearized ZK equation obeying uniform-in-time spatial localization. Such nontrivial linear solutions are excluded by a local-viral space-time estimate. The general framework of the argument is modeled on Merle [29] and Martel &amp; Merle [24], who treated the 1D problem of the $L^2$-critical gKdV equation. Several new features are introduced here to handle the 2D ZK case.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion as the limit of a short range potential Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional diffusion equation is rigorously derived as a scaling limit from a deterministic Rayleigh gas, where
  particles interact via short range potentials with support of size $\varepsilon$ and the background is distributed in space $\mathbb{R}^3$ according to a Poisson process with intensity $N$ and in velocity according to some fat-tailed distribution. As an intermediate step a linear Boltzmann equation is obtained in the Boltzmann-Grad limit as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity with $N \varepsilon^2 =c$. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. The fractional diffusion equation is a hydrodynamic limit for times $t \in [0,T]$, where $T$ and inverse mean free path $c$ can both be chosen as some negative rational power $\varepsilon^{-k}$.</description>

      <title>The heat flow on glued spaces with varying dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new concept of glued manifolds and investigate under which conditions the canonical heat flow on these glued manifolds is ergodic and irreducible. Glued manifolds are metric spaces consisting of manifolds of varying dimension connected by a weakly doubling measure. This can be seen as a condition on the jump in dimension. From another perspective, this construction also defines the Brownian motion on these glued spaces. Using the heat flow, we construct a nonlocal perimeter functional, the heat excess, to raise the question of its ${\Gamma}$-convergence to the standard perimeter functional.
  In this context, we connect our work to the previous work on the convergence of perimeter functionals, approximations, and existence of heat kernels, as well as short-time expansions of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>On a nonlinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion system applied to image restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with a novel nonlinear coupled nonlocal reaction-diffusion system proposed for image restoration, characterized by the advantages of preserving low gray level features and textures.The gray level indicator in the proposed model is regularized using a new method based on porous media type equations, which is suitable for recovering noisy blurred images. The well-posedness, regularity, and other properties of the model are investigated, addressing the lack of theoretical analysis in those existing similar types of models. Numerical experiments conducted on texture and satellite images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in denoising and deblurring tasks.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dissipation via spontaneous stochasticity with a two-dimensional autonomous velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study anomalous dissipation in the context of passive scalars and we construct a two-dimensional autonomous divergence-free velocity field in $C^\alpha$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ arbitrary but fixed) which exhibits anomalous dissipation. Our proof employs the fluctuation-dissipation formula, which links spontaneous stochasticity with anomalous dissipation. Therefore, we address the issue of anomalous dissipation by showing that the variance of stochastic trajectories, in the zero noise limit, remains positive. Based on this result, we answer Question 2.2 and Question 2.3 in [Bru\`{e} &amp; De Lellis '22] regarding anomalous dissipation for the forced three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On the justification of Koiter's model for generalised membrane shells of the "first kind'' confined in a half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we justify Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. After showing that the confinement condition considered in this paper is in general stronger, under the validity of the Kirchhoff-Love assumptions, than the classical Signorini condition, we formulate the corresponding obstacle problem for a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell of the first kind, and we conduct a rigorous asymptotic analysis as the thickness approaches to zero on the unique solution for one such model. We show that the solution to the three-dimensional obstacle problem converges to the unique solution of a two-dimensional model consisting of a set of variational inequalities that are posed over the abstract completion of a non-empty, closed and convex set. We recall that the two-dimensional limit model obtained departing from Koiter's model is characterised by the same variational inequalities as the two-dimensional model obtained departing from the variational formulation of a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space, with the remarkable difference that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought do not coincide, in general. In order to complete the justification of Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a half-space, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought coincide.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order beam equations with clamped boundary conditions are derived. The results extend atheorem of P.

Abstract: We consider an elliptic system of Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky type in a bounded and smooth domain of R3 with a non constant coupling factor. This kind of system has been introduced in the mathematical literature in [14] and in the last years many contributions appeared. In particular here we present the results in [2] and [34] which show existence of solutions by means of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory under different boundary conditions on the electrostatic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the Direct Method in the Calculus of Variations for free-discontinuity energies whose bulk and surface densities exhibit superlinear growth, respectively for large gradients and small jump amplitudes. A distinctive feature of this kind of models is that the functionals are defined on $SBV$ functions whose jump sets may have infinite measure. Establishing general lower semicontinuity and relaxation results in this setting requires new analytical techniques. In addition, we propose a variational approximation of certain superlinear energies via phase field models.</description>

      <title>The formation of gradient-driven singular structures of codimension one and two in two-dimensions: The case study of ferronematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional variational model for ferronematics -- composite materials formed by dispersing magnetic nanoparticles into a liquid crystal matrix. The model features two coupled order parameters: a Landau-de Gennes~$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor for the liquid crystal component and a magnetisation vector field~$\mathbf{M}$, both of them governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type energy. The energy includes a singular coupling term favouring alignment between~$\mathbf{Q}$ and~$\mathbf{M}$. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of (not necessarily minimizing) critical points as a small parameter~$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. Our main results show that the energy concentrates along distinct singular sets: the (rescaled) energy density for the~$\mathbf{Q}$-component concentrates, to leading order, on a finite number of singular points, while the energy density for the~$\mathbf{M}$-component concentrate along a one-dimensional rectifiable set. Moreover, we prove that the curvature of the singular set for the $\M$-component (technically, the first variation of the associated varifold) is concentrated on a finite number of points, i.e.~the singular set for the~$\Q$-component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes how the {\it large box limit} fundamentally alters the global existence theory and dynamics behavior of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system with small viscosity/resistivity $(0&lt;\mu\ll 1)$ on periodic domains $Q_L=[-L,L]^3$, in presence of a strong background magnetic field. While the existence of global solutions (viscous Alfv\'en waves) on the whole space $\R^3$ was previously established in \cite{He-Xu-Yu}, such results cannot be expected for general finite periodic domains. We demonstrate that global solutions do exist on the torus $Q_L=[-L,L]^3$ precisely when the domain exceeds a size $L_\mu&gt;e^{\f1\mu}$, providing the first quantitative characterization of the transition to infinite-domain-like behavior.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate unique continuation principles for solutions $u$ of uniformly elliptic equations of the form $-\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u) = 0$ when $A$ is less regular than Lipschitz. For general matrices $A$, we prove that strong unique continuation holds provided that $A$ has modulus of continuity $\omega$ satisfying the Osgood condition $\int_0^1 \omega(t)^{-1}dt = \infty$, plus some other mild hypotheses. Along with the counterexamples of Mandache, this shows that the sharp condition on $A$ that guarantees unique continuation is essentially that $A$ is log-Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Front Tracking for Scalar Conservation Laws with Spatially Heterogeneous Flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel front tracking scheme for scalar conservation laws with spatially heterogeneous, uniformly convex flux and prove that approximations converge to the unique entropy solution. The main tools are Dafermos' generalised characteristics and Kruzkov's entropies. Crucially, our method handles fluxes where classical theory fails completely. As a concrete demonstration, we construct entropy solutions for a Cauchy problem with flux $f(x,u)=xu^2$, where bounded initial data can become unbounded in finite time, even on compact spatial domains. This finite-time blow-up violates the maximum principle, rendering all classical existence techniques--based on $L^{\infty}$ estimates and compactness--inapplicable. However, the flux $f(x,u(x,t))$ remains bounded despite $u$ blowing up, and our front tracking scheme exploits this to construct approximations that converge to an entropy solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this manuscript is to investigate the global behavior of the solutions to the viscoelastic wave equation with a linear memory term of Boltzmann type, and a nonlinear damping modeling friction, as well as a supercritical source term which is a combined power-type nonlinearities. The global existence of the solutions is obtained provided that the energy sink dominates the energy source in an appropriate sense. In more general scenarios, we prove the global existence of the solutions if the initial history value $u_0$ is taken from a subset of a suitable potential well. Based on global existence results, the energy decay rate is derived which depends on the relaxation kernel as well as the growth rate of the damping term. In addition, we study blow-up of solutions when the source is stronger than dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the random Cauchy problem for the fully nonlocal telegraph equation of power type with the general $(\mathcal{PC}^{\ast})$ type kernel $(a,b)$. This equation can effectively characterize high-frequency signal transmission in small-scale systems. We establish a new completely positive kernel induced by $b$ (see Appendix \refeq{app b}) and derive two novel solution operators by using the relaxation functions associated with the new kernel,which are closely related to the operators $\cos(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ and $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{\beta}{4} }\sin(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ for $\beta\in(1,2]$. These operators enable, for the first time, the derivation of mixed-norm $L_t^qL_x^{p'}$ estimates for the novel solution operators. Next, utilizing probabilistic randomization methods, we establish the average effects, the local existence and uniqueness for a large set of initial data $u^\omega \in L^{2}(\Omega, H^{s,p}(\mathbb R^3))$ ($p\in (1,2)$) while also obtaining probabilistic estimates for local existence under randomized initial conditions. The results reveal a critical phenomenon in the temporal regularity of the solution regarding the regularity index $s$ of the initial data $u^\omega$.</description>

      <title>On the spectral stability of periodic capillary-gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves in the two dimensional gravity-capillary water wave problem. We derive a stability criterion based on an index function, whose sign determines the spectral stability of the waves. This result aligns with earlier formal analyses by Djordjevi\'c \&amp; Redekopp [15] and Ablowitz \&amp; Segur [1], which employed the nonlinear Schr\"odinger approximation in the modulational regime. In particular, we show that instability is excluded near spectral crossings away from the origin when the surface tension is positive and the inverse square of the Froude number $\alpha\in(0,1),$ which results from the fact that the corresponding Krein signatures are identical. It is also shown that there exists $\alpha_1 = (23 - 3\sqrt{41})/8$ and a curve $\beta: (\alpha_1, 1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+},$ such that for any $\alpha \in (\alpha_1, 1]$, small amplitude periodic waves are spectrally stable when $\beta &gt; \beta(\alpha)$. These findings highlight the stabilizing effect of surface tension on periodic capillary-gravity waves.</description>

      <title>Super-Liouville equation with a spinorial Yamabe type term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the super-Liouville equation with a spinorial Yamabe type term, a natural generalization of Liouville equation, super-Liouville equation and spinorial Yamabe type equation. We establish some refined qualitative properties for such a blow-up sequence. In particular, we show energy identities not only for the spinor part but also for the function part. Moreover, the local masses at a blow-up point are also computed. A new phenomenon is that there are two kinds of singularities and local masses due to the nonlinear spinorial Yamabe type term, which is different from super-Liouville equation.</description>

      <title>Time-harmonic scattering of plane waves from an infinite periodically inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new radiation condition for an infinite inhomogeneous two-dimensional medium which is periodic in the vertical direction and remains invariant in the horizontal direction. The classical Rayleigh-expansion radiation condition does not apply to our case, because this would require the medium to be inhomogeneous in a half plane. We utilize the Floquet theory to derive upward/downward wave modes and define radiation conditions by expansions w.r.t. these modes. The downward radiation conditions leads to a downward Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which can be used to truncate the infinite inhomogeneous domain in the vertical direction. So we prove mapping properties of the upward/downward Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps based on the asymptotic behavior of high-order wave modes. Finally, we verify the strong ellipticity of the sesquilinear form corresponding to the new scattering problem and show the unique solvability for all wavenumbers with the exception of a countable set of numbers bounded below by a small positive constant.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves and large deviations for 2D pure gravity deep water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rogue waves are extreme ocean events characterized by the sudden formation of anomalously large crests, and remain an important subject of investigation in oceanography and mathematics. A central problem is to quantify the probability of their formation under random Gaussian sea initial data. In this work, we rigorously characterize the tail-probability for the formation of rogue waves of the pure gravity water wave equations in deep water, the most accurate quasilinear PDE modeling waves in open ocean. This large deviation result rigorously proves various conjectures from the oceanography literature in the weakly nonlinear regime. Moreover, the result holds up to the optimal timescales allowed by deterministic well-posedness theory. The proof shows that rogue waves most likely arise through "dispersive focusing", where phase quasi-synchronization produces constructive amplification of the water crest. The main difficulty in justifying this mechanism is propagating statistical information over such long timescales, which we overcome by combining normal forms and probabilistic methods. Unlike prior work, this novel approach does not require approximate solutions to be Gaussian. Our general method tracks the tail probability of solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs with an integrable normal form and random Gaussian initial data over very long times, even in the absence of (quasi-)invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Existence results for variational quasilinear elliptic systems involving the vectiorial $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence and regularity results for the following elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\textbf{div}(|D\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}D\boldsymbol{u})=\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u}) &amp; \text{in } \Omega \\ \boldsymbol{u}=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\boldsymbol{u}=(u^1,\dots,u^m)$, $p&gt;1$, and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain. We also consider the special case
  \[\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u})=\lambda|\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}\boldsymbol{u}+|\boldsymbol{u}|^{q-2}\boldsymbol{u},\] and we prove a classification result. In particular, we show that any least energy solution is of the form $(c^1\omega,\dots,c^m\omega)$, where $\boldsymbol{c}=(c^1,\dots,c^m)\in S^{m-1}$ (the $(m-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb R^m$) and $\omega$ is a positive solution of the corresponding scalar equation.</description>

      <title>Improved Gevrey Class Regularity of the Kadomtsev Petviashvili Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve and extend the results obtained by Boukarou et al. \cite{boukarou1} on the Gevrey regularity of solutions to a fifth-order Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP)-type equation. We establish Gevrey regularity in the time variable for solutions in $2+1$ dimensions, providing a sharper result obtained through a new analytical approach. Assuming that the initial data are Gevrey regular of order $\sigma \geq 1$ in the spatial variables, we prove that the corresponding solution is Gevrey regular of order $5 \sigma$ in time. Moreover, we show that the function $u(x, y, t)$, viewed as a function of $t$, does not belong to $G^z$ for any $1 \leq z&lt;5 \sigma$. The proof simultaneously treats all three variables $x, y$, and $t$, and employs the method of majorant series, precisely tracking the influence of the higher-order dispersive term $\partial_x^5 u$ together with the lower-order terms $\alpha \partial_x^3 u, \partial_x^{-1} \partial_y^2 u$, and $u \partial_x u$.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff dimension of planar elliptic measures via quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of planar elliptic measure via the application of quasiconformal mappings, with these bounds depending solely on the ellipticity constant of the matrix. In fact, in our case studies, we find a quasiconformal mapping that relates the elliptic measure in a domain to the harmonic measure in its image domain, allowing us to deduce bounds for the dimension of the elliptic measure from the known results on the harmonic side. This extends previous works of Makarov, Jones and Wolff.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Transport for Discrete Multi-Dimensional Schr\"odinger Operators With Decaying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a decaying potential, in arbitrary lattice dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}^*$, where $\Delta$ is the standard discrete Laplacian and $V_n = o(|n|^{-1})$ as $|n| \to \infty$. We prove that the unitary evolution $e^{-i tH}$ exhibits ballistic transport in the sense that, for any $r &gt; 0$, the weighted $\ell^2-$norm $$\|e^{-i tH}u\|_r:=\left(\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} (1+|n|^2)^{r} |(e^{-i tH}u)_n|^2\right)^\frac12 $$ grows at rate $\simeq t^r$ as $t\to \infty$, provided that the initial state $u$ is in the absolutely continuous subspace and satisfies $\|u\|_r&lt;\infty$.
  The proof relies on commutator methods and a refined Mourre estimate, which yields quantitative lower bounds on transport for operators with purely absolutely continuous spectrum over appropriate spectral intervals. Compactness arguments and localized spectral projections are used to extend the result to perturbed operators, extending the classical result for the free Laplacian to a broader class of decaying potentials.</description>

      <title>Continuity for Sobolev mappings with null Lagrangian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of Sobolev functions $\varphi \in W^{1,n}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, that satisfy \[
  \lvert\nabla \varphi(x)\rvert^n \le K(x)\bigl(\langle \nabla \varphi(x), \xi(x)\rangle + A(x)\bigr), \] where $\xi \in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^{n/(n-1)}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ is weakly divergence-free, and $K \in L^p_{\mathrm{loc}} (\Omega)$, $A \in L^q_{\mathrm{loc}} (\Omega)$ are non-negative with $p^{-1}+q^{-1}&lt;1$. The result is applicable to a broad class of differential inequalities of null Lagrangian type. As our principal application, we obtain a sharp continuity theorem for $f \in W^{1,n}_{\mathrm{loc}} (\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfying the distortion inequality with defect $\lvert Df(x)\rvert^n \le K(x)\det Df(x) + \Sigma(x)$; this result is new even in the planar case, and closes a significant gap between existing methods and known counterexamples. The proof relies on an overlooked Sobolev-type inequality formulated in terms of measures of superlevel sets.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Sampler-based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory, we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO. While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our theoretical findings.</description>
