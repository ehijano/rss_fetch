      <title>Egoistic MDS-based Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel anchorless rigid body localization (RBL) suitable for application in autonomous driving (AD), in so far as the algorithm enables a rigid body to egoistically detect the location (relative translation) and orientation (relative rotation) of another body, without knowledge of the shape of the latter, based only on a set of measurements of the distances between sensors of one vehicle to the other. A key point of the proposed method is that the translation vector between the two-bodies is modeled using the double-centering operator from multidimensional scaling (MDS) theory, enabling the method to be used between rigid bodies regardless of their shapes, in contrast to conventional approaches which require both bodies to have the same shape. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimates in different setups.</description>

      <title>ELEGNT: Expressive and Functional Movement Design for Non-anthropomorphic Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are essential for conveying internal states, both consciously and unconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities, such as intention, attention, and emotions, alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment and time efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and expressive objectives in movement design. Using a research-through-design methodology, we document the hardware design process, define expressive movement primitives, and outline a set of interaction scenario storyboards. We propose a framework that incorporates both functional and expressive utilities during movement generation, and implement the robot behavior sequences in different function- and social- oriented tasks. Through a user study comparing expression-driven versus function-driven movements across six task scenarios, our findings indicate that expression-driven movements significantly enhance user engagement and perceived robot qualities. This effect is especially pronounced in social-oriented tasks.</description>

      <title>Interaction Dataset of Autonomous Vehicles with Traffic Lights and Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dataset capturing interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and traffic control devices, specifically traffic lights and stop signs. Derived from the Waymo Motion dataset, our work addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by providing real-world trajectory data on how AVs navigate these traffic control devices. We propose a methodology for identifying and extracting relevant interaction trajectory data from the Waymo Motion dataset, incorporating over 37,000 instances with traffic lights and 44,000 with stop signs. Our methodology includes defining rules to identify various interaction types, extracting trajectory data, and applying a wavelet-based denoising method to smooth the acceleration and speed profiles and eliminate anomalous values, thereby enhancing the trajectory quality. Quality assessment metrics indicate that trajectories obtained in this study have anomaly proportions in acceleration and jerk profiles reduced to near-zero levels across all interaction categories. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to address the current gap in datasets containing AV interaction behaviors with traffic lights and signs. Based on the organized and published dataset, we can gain a more in-depth understanding of AVs' behavior when interacting with traffic lights and signs. This will facilitate research on AV integration into existing transportation infrastructures and networks, supporting the development of more accurate behavioral models and simulation tools.</description>

      <title>A 3-Step Optimization Framework with Hybrid Models for a Humanoid Robot's Jump Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dynamic jump motions are challenging tasks for humanoid robots to achieve environment adaptation and obstacle crossing. The trajectory optimization is a practical method to achieve high-dynamic and explosive jumping. This paper proposes a 3-step trajectory optimization framework for generating a jump motion for a humanoid robot. To improve iteration speed and achieve ideal performance, the framework comprises three sub-optimizations. The first optimization incorporates momentum, inertia, and center of pressure (CoP), treating the robot as a static reaction momentum pendulum (SRMP) model to generate corresponding trajectories. The second optimization maps these trajectories to joint space using effective Quadratic Programming (QP) solvers. Finally, the third optimization generates whole-body joint trajectories utilizing trajectories generated by previous parts. With the combined consideration of momentum and inertia, the robot achieves agile forward jump motions. A simulation and experiments (Fig. \ref{Fig First page fig}) of forward jump with a distance of 1.0 m and 0.5 m height are presented in this paper, validating the applicability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>AnyNav: Visual Neuro-Symbolic Friction Learning for Off-road Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-road navigation is essential for a wide range of applications in field robotics such as planetary exploration and disaster response. However, it remains an unresolved challenge due to the unstructured environments and inherent complexity of terrain-vehicle interactions. Traditional physics-based methods struggle to accurately model the nonlinear dynamics of these interactions, while data-driven approaches often suffer from overfitting to specific motion patterns, vehicle sizes, and types, limiting their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a vision-based friction estimation framework grounded in neuro-symbolic principles, integrating neural networks for visual perception with symbolic reasoning for physical modeling. This enables significantly improved generalization abilities through explicit physical reasoning incorporating the predicted friction. Additionally, we develop a physics-informed planner that leverages the learned friction coefficient to generate physically feasible and efficient paths, along with corresponding speed profiles. We refer to our approach as AnyNav and evaluate it in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its utility and robustness across various off-road scenarios and multiple types of four-wheeled vehicles. These results mark an important step toward developing neuro-symbolic spatial intelligence to reason about complex, unstructured environments and enable autonomous off-road navigation in challenging scenarios. Video demonstrations are available at https://sairlab.org/anynav/, where the source code will also be released.</description>

      <title>Grid-based Submap Joining: An Efficient Algorithm for Simultaneously Optimizing Global Occupancy Map and Local Submap Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing robot poses and the map simultaneously has been shown to provide more accurate SLAM results. However, for non-feature based SLAM approaches, directly optimizing all the robot poses and the whole map will greatly increase the computational cost, making SLAM problems difficult to solve in large-scale environments. To solve the 2D non-feature based SLAM problem in large-scale environments more accurately and efficiently, we propose the grid-based submap joining method. Specifically, we first formulate the 2D grid-based submap joining problem as a non-linear least squares (NLLS) form to optimize the global occupancy map and local submap frames simultaneously. We then prove that in solving the NLLS problem using Gauss-Newton (GN) method, the increments of the poses in each iteration are independent of the occupancy values of the global occupancy map. Based on this property, we propose a poseonly GN algorithm equivalent to full GN method to solve the NLLS problem. The proposed submap joining algorithm is very efficient due to the independent property and the pose-only solution. Evaluations using simulations and publicly available practical 2D laser datasets confirm the outperformance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy, as well as the ability to solve the grid-based SLAM problem in very large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Int2Planner: An Intention-based Multi-modal Motion Planner for Integrated Prediction and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning is a critical module in autonomous driving, with the primary challenge of uncertainty caused by interactions with other participants. As most previous methods treat prediction and planning as separate tasks, it is difficult to model these interactions. Furthermore, since the route path navigates ego vehicles to a predefined destination, it provides relatively stable intentions for ego vehicles and helps constrain uncertainty. On this basis, we construct Int2Planner, an \textbf{Int}ention-based \textbf{Int}egrated motion \textbf{Planner} achieves multi-modal planning and prediction. Instead of static intention points, Int2Planner utilizes route intention points for ego vehicles and generates corresponding planning trajectories for each intention point to facilitate multi-modal planning. The experiments on the private dataset and the public nuPlan benchmark show the effectiveness of route intention points, and Int2Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also deploy it in real-world vehicles and have conducted autonomous driving for hundreds of kilometers in urban areas. It further verifies that Int2Planner can continuously interact with the traffic environment. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/cxlz/Int2Planner.</description>

      <title>PSGSL: A Probabilistic Framework Integrating Semantic Scene Understanding and Gas Sensing for Gas Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic scene understanding allows a robotic agent to reason about problems in complex ways, using information from multiple and varied sensors to make deductions about a particular matter. As a result, this form of intelligent robotics is capable of performing more complex tasks and achieving more precise results than simpler approaches based on single data sources. However, these improved capabilities come at the cost of higher complexity, both computational and in terms of design. Due to the increased design complexity, formal approaches for exploiting semantic understanding become necessary.
  We present here a probabilistic formulation for integrating semantic knowledge into the process of gas source localization (GSL). The problem of GSL poses many unsolved challenges, and proposed solutions need to contend with the constraining limitations of sensing hardware. By exploiting semantic scene understanding, we can leverage other sources of information, such as vision, to improve the estimation of the source location. We show how our formulation can be applied to pre-existing GSL algorithms and the effect that including semantic data has on the produced estimations of the location of the source.</description>

      <title>Drone Carrier: An Integrated Unmanned Surface Vehicle for Autonomous Inspection and Intervention in GNSS-Denied Maritime Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative drone carrier concept that is applied in maritime port security or offshore rescue. This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</description>

      <title>AdaWM: Adaptive World Model based Planning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13072v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Control-ITRA: Controlling the Behavior of a Driving Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating realistic driving behavior is crucial for developing and testing autonomous systems in complex traffic environments. Equally important is the ability to control the behavior of simulated agents to tailor scenarios to specific research needs and safety considerations. This paper extends the general-purpose multi-agent driving behavior model ITRA (Scibior et al., 2021), by introducing a method called Control-ITRA to influence agent behavior through waypoint assignment and target speed modulation. By conditioning agents on these two aspects, we provide a mechanism for them to adhere to specific trajectories and indirectly adjust their aggressiveness. We compare different approaches for integrating these conditions during training and demonstrate that our method can generate controllable, infraction-free trajectories while preserving realism in both seen and unseen locations.</description>

      <title>TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</description>

      <title>Fast Ergodic Search with Kernel Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic search enables optimal exploration of an information distribution while guaranteeing the asymptotic coverage of the search space. However, current methods typically have exponential computation complexity in the search space dimension and are restricted to Euclidean space. We introduce a computationally efficient ergodic search method. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop a kernel-based ergodic metric and generalize it from Euclidean space to Lie groups. We formally prove the proposed metric is consistent with the standard ergodic metric while guaranteeing linear complexity in the search space dimension. Secondly, we derive the first-order optimality condition of the kernel ergodic metric for nonlinear systems, which enables efficient trajectory optimization. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks show that the proposed method is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm with a peg-in-hole insertion task. We formulate the problem as a coverage task in the space of SE(3) and use a 30-second-long human demonstration as the prior distribution for ergodic coverage. Ergodicity guarantees the asymptotic solution of the peg-in-hole problem so long as the solution resides within the prior information distribution, which is seen in the 100% success rate.</description>

      <title>Tightly Coupled SLAM with Imprecise Architectural Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots navigating indoor environments often have access to architectural plans, which can serve as prior knowledge to enhance their localization and mapping capabilities. While some SLAM algorithms leverage these plans for global localization in real-world environments, they typically overlook a critical challenge: the "as-planned" architectural designs frequently deviate from the "as-built" real-world environments. To address this gap, we present a novel algorithm that tightly couples LIDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping with architectural plans under the presence of deviations. Our method utilizes a multi-layered semantic representation to not only localize the robot, but also to estimate global alignment and structural deviations between "as-planned" and as-built environments in real-time. To validate our approach, we performed experiments in simulated and real datasets demonstrating robustness to structural deviations up to 35 cm and 15 degrees. On average, our method achieves 43% less localization error than baselines in simulated environments, while in real environments, the as-built 3D maps show 7% lower average alignment error</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</description>

      <title>TelePreview: A User-Friendly Teleoperation System with Virtual Arm Assistance for Enhanced Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleoperation provides an effective way to collect robot data, which is crucial for learning from demonstrations. In this field, teleoperation faces several key challenges: user-friendliness for new users, safety assurance, and transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation. To address these limitations, we introduce TelePreview. This teleoperation system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePreview allows the user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly and safely. We demonstrate that it outperforms other teleoperation systems across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its straightforward deployment across diverse robotic platforms. We release our code and a deployment document on our website https://telepreview.github.io.</description>

      <title>Design Optimizer for Soft Growing Robot Manipulators in Three-Dimensional Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but operates in a more efficient way, at 1.5 times the speed of human expert. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</description>

      <title>SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</description>

      <title>LatentBKI: Open-Dictionary Continuous Mapping in Visual-Language Latent Spaces with Quantifiable Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel probabilistic mapping algorithm, LatentBKI, which enables open-vocabulary mapping with quantifiable uncertainty. Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. LatentBKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). LatentBKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular Matterport3D and Semantic KITTI datasets, demonstrating that LatentBKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.</description>
