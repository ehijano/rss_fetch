      <title>Deuterium-Tritium Levitated Dipole Fusion Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated dipole reactors offer an attractive path towards economic fusion power generation. The intrinsic decoupling of the confining magnetic field-generating REBCO magnets and the vacuum vessel offer unparalleled accessibility and maintainability, allowing for high plant duty factors and theoretically low electricity prices. In order to achieve rapid deployment of fusion power to the grid, the use of the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel cycle is required due to its lower required plasma triple products. Historically, designs of levitated dipole fusion power plants have targeted advanced fuels as a DT device was seen to be infeasible due to the high fluxes of 14.1 MeV neutrons on the superconducting core magnet. This study presents high level designs for two feasible first-of-a-kind (FOAK) DT levitated dipole fusion power plants, the larger of which produces 667 MW of fusion power and is predicted to produce 208 MW of net electric power. Both designs consist of a heavily neutron-shielded, high-field REBCO core magnet capable of producing peak magnetic field strengths of 23 T while keeping peak mechanical strains below 0.4%. The neutron shielding is comprised of a layered structure of tungsten and boron carbide, which allows for 92% of the heat deposited in the neutron shield to be radiated out to the first wall while still providing sufficient neutron attenuation to give adequate REBCO conductor lifetimes. The core magnet REBCO coil is comprised of a small "sacrificial" section and a larger semi-permanent section. The sacrificial section, comprising ~20% of the coil, will have a neutron damage limited lifetime of ~1 year, after which the core magnet will be quickly removed from the vacuum vessel and replaced. This allows the damaged core magnet to be refurbished and reused, reducing cost and allowing for economic fusion power generation from a DT levitated dipole reactor.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable numerical schemes for divergence diminishing Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low equations for plasma flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low (CGL) equations are a set of hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products used to model the plasma flows, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not valid, and the pressure tensor is assumed to be rotated by the magnetic field. This results in the pressure tensor, which is described by the two scalar components. As the magnetic field also evolves, controlling the divergence of the magnetic field is important. In this work, we consider the generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique for the CGL model. The resulting model is referred to as the GLM-CGL system. To make the system suitable for entropy-stable schemes, we reformulate the GLM-CGL system by treating some conservative terms as non-conservative. The resulting system has a non-conservative part that does not affect entropy evolution. We then propose entropy stable numerical methods for the GLM-CGL model. The numerical results for the GLM-CGL system are then compared with the CGL system without the GLM divergence diminishing approach to demonstrate that the GLM approach indeed leads to significant improvement in the magnetic field divergence diminishing.</description>

      <title>A coherent structure transport model for scrape-off layer turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the locality of high-temperature plasma energy deposition on material surfaces in fusion reactors is critical for design. Here, we utilize the Gyrokinetic ElectroMagnetic turbulence including X-points (GEMX) simulation, together with SOLPS-ITER solutions for the background equilibrium electric field including drifts, to model the heat flux at the divertor plate and characterize the heat load width using realistic X-point geometry. We use a theory-based blobby transport model called the "Coherent Structure Transport" (CST) model to include the effect of plasma transport in the edge scrape-off layer. The CST model is extremely fast and can be used to quickly analyze any SOLPS-ITER solution. SOLPS-ITER provides the steady state, or equilibrium on which we superimpose blobby turbulence characterized by blob size, amplitude and frequency. We obtain the $1/B_p$ scaling of the heat load exponential decay width $\lambda_q$, in agreement with the Eich empirical scaling and with the Goldston heuristic theory. When including blobby turbulence in combination with the SOLPS-ITER electric field, we find a secondary peak in the heat flux radial profile, outwardly displaced from the strike point radius, with a relative amplitude that is proportional to the initial blob density. We describe the CST model in detail and provide initial investigations of the scaling of $\lambda_q$ and the secondary heat flux peak with blob size and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Fast Spectrogram Event Extraction via Offline Self-Supervised Learning: From Fusion Diagnostics to Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation fusion facilities like ITER face a "data deluge," generating petabytes of multi-diagnostic signals daily that challenge manual analysis. We present a "signals-first" self-supervised framework for the automated extraction of coherent and transient modes from high-noise time-frequency data. We also develop a general-purpose method and tool for extracting coherent, quasi-coherent, and transient modes for fluctuation measurements in tokamaks by employing non-linear optimal techniques in multichannel signal processing with a fast neural network surrogate on fast magnetics, electron cyclotron emission, CO2 interferometers, and beam emission spectroscopy measurements from DIII-D. Results are tested on data from DIII-D, TJ-II, and non-fusion spectrograms. With an inference latency of 0.5 seconds, this framework enables real-time mode identification and large-scale automated database generation for advanced plasma control.

      <title>Radiation damage to normal mammalian tissue in vivo with laser-driven protons at ultra-high instantaneous dose rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential sparing of normal tissues relative to tumor control observed at ultra-high dose rates, referred to as the FLASH effect, has recently gained considerable attention. The therapeutic advantages of FLASH radiotherapy are expected to be further amplified through the use of protons and ions, which enable precise dose deposition at tumor depth while minimizing irradiation of healthy tissues proximal and distal to the target. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying this sparing effect remains poorly understood. Laser-driven proton accelerators are capable of delivering uniquely high instantaneous dose rates in ultrashort bunches. Here, we report the first in vivo investigation of normal tissue response to laser-driven proton irradiation. Our findings reveal a reduction in tissue swelling following laser-driven proton treatment compared with X-ray irradiations at conventional dose rates. RNA sequencing identified differential gene expression associated with immune and epidermal programs following laser-driven proton irradiations at two different dose levels.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Spatial Complexity in Flare Ribbon Substructure and Its Relationship to Magnetic Reconnection Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Strong Alfv\'enic MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfv\'en waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfv\'en waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfv\'en wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfv\'en waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfv\'en waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfv\'en waves is still important.</description>

      <title>Rotation of a Solar Jet Driven by Plasma Flow along Helical Magnetic Fields in an Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar jets, collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, play a vital role in energy transport and coronal heating. While rotational motions in jets are often attributed to magnetic field untwisting, alternative explanatory mechanisms remain possible. This study investigates a rotating jet in an active region observed on 2023 August 1 using multi-wavelength observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), combined with a self-consistent time-dependent magnetofrictional (TMF) model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Spectral diagnostics reveal coexisting red and blue shifts along the edges and central axis of the jet, indicating helical plasma motion within a twisted magnetic structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the jet's rotation arises from plasma propagating along helical open field lines, formed via reconnection between a pre-existing flux rope and overlying magnetic fields. Contrary to classical untwisting models, both linear and rotational velocities decrease with altitude during the jet propagation. These results highlight that the observed rotation results from plasma spiral motion along twisted fields rather than untwisting dynamics of the magnetic field itself, providing new insights into solar jet energetics and their connection to broader solar phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction of an ion with a fluctuation in the electromagnetic fields that is localized in both space and time. We study the scale-dependence of the interaction in both space and time, deriving a generic form for the ion's energy change, which involves an exponential cutoff based on the characteristic timescale of the electromagnetic fluctuation. This leads to diffusion in energy in both $v_\perp$ and $v_\parallel$. We show how to apply our results to general plasma physics phenomena, and specifically to Alfv\'enic turbulence and to reconnection. Our theory can be viewed as a unification of previous models of stochastic ion heating, cyclotron heating, and reconnection heating in a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most current stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: stage-1 for the equilibrium and stage-2 for a coil design that reproduces its magnetic configuration. Because few proxies connect both stages, two-stage optimization can produce plasmas that have high-quality physical properties but overly complex coils. In recent years, single-stage optimization is increasingly used to optimize the plasma and coils simultaneously, in order to improve the plasma-coil balance. However, all existing single-stage tools are specialized for filament coils, cannot model coil systems containing permanent magnets (PM) or dipole arrays, and remain challenged by numerical problems.The quasi-single-stage (QSS) optimization finds a middle-ground by integrating a coil optimization subproblem into stage-1 optimization. We present a flexible, differentiable coil complexity proxy based on the newly developed QUADCOIL coil optimization code. QUADCOIL is fast and can target realistic coil metrics and constraints that are unavailable to codes with comparable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the QUADCOIL proxy by presenting two QSS optimization studies. The first study produces a permanent magnet solution for the MUSE stellarator with 29% fewer magnets than previous solutions. The second study produces a coil solution for the ARIES-CS stellarator with approx 30% reductions in both peak and average coil force.</description>

      <title>On Topology of Perturbed Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-helicity vortices, such as Hill's vortex and field-reversed configurations (FRCs), have long been assumed to be toroidal in topology. This paper proves this assumption false: even under arbitrarily small odd-parity (with respect to the z-axis of symmetry) perturbations, flux surfaces in the interior region become simply connected in topology with crescent-shaped boundaries. A new inner separatrix emerges, separating toroidal flux surfaces in an intermediate region from simply connected surfaces in the core. In a spherical vortex with perturbations at roughly 10% of the background field strength, the simply connected region occupies ~40% of the total closed-field-line volume. The analysis rigorously proves the conjecture regarding field-line closure under odd-parity perturbations in a full three-dimensional context, completing previous partial proofs in two-dimensional geometry. Preliminary numerical simulations of charged particle trajectories in field-reversed configurations revealed crescent-shaped drift surfaces even for small gyroradii. Given that FRCs are sustained by rotating magnetic fields with odd parity, these results motivate a revision of FRC-related fusion confinement physics. Furthermore, given the mathematical equivalence to Hill's vortex, this updates our topological understanding of fluid flow in a wide array of phenomena.</description>
