      <title>Domination in Graph Theory: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Trends, Collaboration and Citation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research on domination in graph theory from 1961 to 2024, based on Scopus-indexed publications retrieved using the query (dominating OR domination) AND graph. The analysis examines publication trends, key contributors, collaboration patterns, citation impact, and emerging research themes. Results indicate a significant and sustained increase in research output, particularly in recent decades. Henning, M.A., Hedetniemi, S.T., and Haynes, T.W. are identified as the most highly cited researchers, underscoring their foundational contributions to the field. Co-authorship network analysis reveals strong international collaborations, with Sheikhholeslami, S.M. exhibiting the highest total link strength, while the United States emerges as the leading hub for global research partnerships. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies four major research clusters: graph algorithms, graph-theoretic foundations, domination variants, and binary graph operations. Notably, recent studies increasingly focus on how domination properties evolve under different graph operations. Citation network analysis confirms the enduring influence of foundational studies while highlighting a shift towards computational and applied methodologies. These findings highlight the transition from theoretical to applied research, emphasizing the role of advanced algorithms, interdisciplinary approaches, and large-scale computational techniques. Future research directions should explore machine learning-based optimization, domination in evolving networks, and applications in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and large-scale social networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simulator designed for opinion dynamics researchers to model competing influences within social networks in the presence of LLM-based agents. By integrating established opinion dynamics principles with state-of-the-art LLMs, this tool enables the study of influence propagation and counter-misinformation strategies. The simulator is particularly valuable for researchers in social science, psychology, and operations research, allowing them to analyse societal phenomena without requiring extensive coding expertise. Additionally, the simulator will be openly available on GitHub, ensuring accessibility and adaptability for those who wish to extend its capabilities for their own research.</description>

      <title>Hard negative sampling in hyperedge prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph, which allows each hyperedge to encompass an arbitrary number of nodes, is a powerful tool for modeling multi-entity interactions. Hyperedge prediction is a fundamental task that aims to predict future hyperedges or identify existent but unobserved hyperedges based on those observed. In link prediction for simple graphs, most observed links are treated as positive samples, while all unobserved links are considered as negative samples. However, this full-sampling strategy is impractical for hyperedge prediction, due to the number of unobserved hyperedges in a hypergraph significantly exceeds the number of observed ones. Therefore, one has to utilize some negative sampling methods to generate negative samples, ensuring their quantity is comparable to that of positive samples. In current hyperedge prediction, randomly selecting negative samples is a routine practice. But through experimental analysis, we discover a critical limitation of random selecting that the generated negative samples are too easily distinguishable from positive samples. This leads to premature convergence of the model and reduces the accuracy of prediction. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method to generate negative samples, named as hard negative sampling (HNS). Unlike traditional methods that construct negative hyperedges by selecting node sets from the original hypergraph, HNS directly synthesizes negative samples in the hyperedge embedding space, thereby generating more challenging and informative negative samples. Our results demonstrate that HNS significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness of the prediction. Moreover, as a plug-and-play technique, HNS can be easily applied in the training of various hyperedge prediction models based on representation learning.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation Via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate graph annotation typically requires substantial labeled data, which is often challenging and resource-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we present Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation via Large Language Model (CSA-LLM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of crowdsourced annotations with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the graph annotation process. CSA-LLM harnesses the structural context of graph data by integrating information from 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors. By emphasizing homophily ties - key connections that signify similarity within the graph - CSA-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by delivering more precise and reliable annotations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Spotify Collaboration Network for Small-World Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the small-world properties of a Spotify artist feature collaboration network, focusing on clustering and diameter. We analyze the giant component and subgraphs based on genres, country-specific charts, and detected communities to assess their small-world characteristics. Results indicate that the network is scale-free and follows a power-law degree distribution, with highly popular artists serving as central hubs. Louvain community detection reveals distinct collaboration clusters aligned with genre-based and industry-driven connections. These findings offer insights into music recommendation systems and digital collaboration trends, contributing to a broader understanding of artist networks in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical community detection benchmark for heterogeneous inter-community connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we introduce a new tool for community detection, a generator of networks, which uses parameters to control the structure of created networks. Typically, network scientists designing novel community detection algorithms use synthetically generated benchmarks with community structures that they intend to detect and scale the benchmark networks across size and density. Currently, available benchmarks use generators limited to the properties of the LFR and GLFR networks. We improve on these previous benchmarks with a new hierarchical benchmark, the HGLFR, that preserves the properties of the LFR and GLFR while extending them to include heterogeneous inter-community connectivity. Networks generated by this benchmark are shown to produce networks with structures triggering the resolution limit while maintaining assortative connectivity.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Link Network Model for Supporting Traceability of Logistics on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of tracing states of logistic transportations requires an efficient storage and retrieval of the state of logistic transportations and locations of logistic objects. However, the restriction of sharing states and locations of logistic objects across organizations from different countries makes it hard to deploy a centralized database for implementing the traceability in a cross-border logistic system. This paper proposes a semantic data model on Blockchain to represent a logistic process based on the Semantic Link Network model where each semantic link represents a logistic transportation of a logistic object between two parties. A state representation model is designed to represent the states of a logistic transportation with semantic links. It enables the locations of logistic objects to be derived from the link states. A mapping from the semantic links to the blockchain transactions is designed to enable schema of semantic links and states of semantic links to be published in blockchain transactions. To improve the efficiency of tracing a path of semantic links on blockchain platform, an algorithm is designed to build shortcuts along the path of semantic links to enable a query on the path of a logistic object to reach the target in logarithmic steps on the blockchain platform. A reward-penalty policy is designed to allow participants to confirm the state of links on blockchain. Analysis and simulation demonstrate the flexibility, effectiveness and the efficiency of Semantic Link Network on immutable blockchain for implementing logistic traceability.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Climate Action: Computer Vision Analysis of Visual Narratives on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, sparking widespread discourse across social media platforms. Activists, policymakers, and researchers seek to understand public sentiment and narratives while access to social media data has become increasingly restricted in the post-API era. In this study, we analyze a dataset of climate change-related tweets from X (formerly Twitter) shared in 2019, containing 730k tweets along with the shared images. Our approach integrates statistical analysis, image classification, object detection, and sentiment analysis to explore visual narratives in climate discourse. Additionally, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactive data exploration. Our findings reveal key themes in climate communication, highlight sentiment divergence between images and text, and underscore the strengths and limitations of foundation models in analyzing social media imagery. By releasing our code and tools, we aim to support future research on the intersection of climate change, social media, and computer vision.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodes in the real-world graphs exhibit diverse patterns in numerous aspects, such as degree and homophily. However, most existent node predictors fail to capture a wide range of node patterns or to make predictions based on distinct node patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we reveal that different node predictors are good at handling nodes with specific patterns and only apply one node predictor uniformly could lead to suboptimal result. To mitigate this gap, we propose a mixture of experts framework, MoE-NP, for node classification. Specifically, MoE-NP combines a mixture of node predictors and strategically selects models based on node patterns. Experimental results from a range of real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements from MoE-NP.</description>
