      <title>Generalized Ginsparg-Wilson relations: Fermionic anomalies on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation elegantly captures how the anomalous chiral symmetry of a Dirac fermion manifests on the lattice. In this talk, we discuss how the GW relation and its closed-form solution, the overlap operator, can be generalized to Majorana or Dirac fermions in any dimension for finite symmetry transformations (continuous or discrete). We find an exact symmetry which reproduces both perturbative and global anomalies on the lattice. These generalized GW fermions are boundary theories of various bulk symmetry-protected topological phases and thus provide an explicit lattice realization of the fermionic bulk-boundary correspondence central to recent proposals for chiral gauge theories on the lattice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HiRep v2, an open-source software suite for high-performance lattice field theory simulations with dynamical Wilson fermions in higher representations of $SU(N_g)$ gauge groups. This new version fully supports GPU acceleration, optimizing both gauge configuration generation and measurements for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. HiRep v2 integrates improved gauge and fermionic lattice actions, advanced inverters, and Monte Carlo algorithms, including (R)HMC with Hasenbusch acceleration. It exhibits excellent scalability across multiple GPUs and nodes with minimal efficiency loss, making it a robust tool for large-scale simulations in physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Towards low-dimensionalization of four-dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube in a hadron, we propose a possible way of low-dimensionalization of 4D QCD. As a strategy, we use gauge degrees of freedom and propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge". The DR gauge is defined so as to minimize $R_{\rm DR} \equiv \int d^4s~{\rm Tr}~[A^2_x(s)+A^2_y(s)]$, which preserves the 2D SU($N_{c}$) gauge symmetry. We investigate low-dimensionalization properties of 4D DR-gauged QCD in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta$ = 6.0. In the DR gauge, the amplitudes of two gluon components $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed, and these components have a large effective mass of $M_{\perp} \simeq 1.7$ GeV. In the DR gauge, the static interquark potential is well reproduced only with the two components $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$, while $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ seem to be inactive. We investigate the spatial correlation of two $t$-directed gluons and find that the correlation decreases as $e^{-mr}$ with $m \simeq$ 0.64 GeV, corresponding to the correlation length $\xi \equiv 1/m \simeq$ 0.31 fm. We reduce 4D QCD in the DR gauge to 2D QCD with the coupling $g_{2D} = g/\xi$, which approximately reproduces the string tension.</description>

      <title>Flavor diagonal nucleon charges using clover fermions on MILC HISQ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice results for the flavor diagonal charges of the proton from the analysis of eight ensembles generated using 2+1+1-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) by the MILC collaboration. The calculation includes all the connected and disconnected contributions to nucleon three-point function. For extracting matrix elements using fits to the spectral decomposition of these correlation functions, two strategies to remove excited state contributions are employed and compared. To renormalize these charges, the 2+1-flavor mixing matrix is calculated in the RI-sMOM intermediate scheme on the lattice. The final results are presented in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at scale 2~GeV. % The axial charges for the proton are $g_A^u = 0.781(25)$, $g_A^d = -0.440(39)$, and $g_A^s = -0.055(9)$; the tensor charges are $g_T^u = 0.782(28)$, $g_T^d = -0.195(10)$, and $g_T^s = -0.0016(12)$; and the scalar charges are $g_S^u = 9.39(88)$, $g_S^d = 8.84(93)$, and $g_S^s = 0.37(14)$. Results for the neutron can be obtained by the $u \leftrightarrow d$ interchange. Results for the sigma terms are $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{\rm standard} = 42(6)~{\rm MeV}$ from a ``standard'' analysis and $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{N \pi} = 62(6)~{\rm MeV}$ from a ``$N\pi$'' analysis that includes the contributions of multihadron $N\pi $ excited states as motivated by chiral perturbation theory. Our preferred value $\sigma_{\pi N}|_{N \pi}$ is consistent with the phenomenological extraction from $\pi- N$ scattering data. The strangeness content of the proton, for which the ``standard'' analysis is appropriate, is $\sigma_{s}|_{\rm standard} = 34(18)~{\rm MeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) -- the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model. Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with constituent-like masses. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches the role played by EHM in shaping hadron electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, exciting nucleon resonances, and moulding hadron parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the power law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <title>Large $\theta$ angle in two-dimensional large $N$ $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In confining large $N$ theories with a $\theta$ angle such as four-dimensional $\rm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory, there are multiple metastable vacua and it makes sense to consider the parameter region of ``large $\theta$ of order $N$'' despite the fact that $\theta$ is a $2\pi$-periodic parameter. We investigate this parameter region in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the partition function on $T^2$. When $\theta/N$ is of order $ \mathcal{O}(0.1) $ or less, we get perfectly sensible results for the vacuum energies and decay rates of metastable vacua. However, when $\theta/N$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(1) $, we encounter a problem about saddle points that would give larger contributions to the partition function than the true vacuum. We discuss why it might not be straightforward to resolve this problem.</description>

      <title>The order of the chiral phase transition in massless many-flavour lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a challenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on the phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the order of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of light quark flavours. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out and extrapolate the chiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the crossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge coupling, the number of quark flavours, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Lattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for each $N_f &lt; 8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^\text{tric}(N_f)$, at which the chiral transition changes from first order ($a&gt;a^\text{tric}$) to second order ($a&lt;a^\text{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is merely a lattice artifact and not connected to the continuum. By determining the associated temperatures $T(N_f^\text{tric},a ^\text{tric})$ at these tricritical points, we confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of flavours increases. The obtained temperatures define a tricritical line which is connected to the continuum and terminates at a physical $ N_f^\text{tric}(a=0) $. Our data is compatible with a vanishing temperature at that point, $T(N_f^\text{tric}(a=0))=0 $.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>

Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protection Zeno phase transition in monitored lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations.
  Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws.
  While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored.
  Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime.
  Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols.
  We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics.
  Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This recently constructed method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory and thus give an evidence that this method can really compute the quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Non(anti)Commutative Superspace, Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Closed Forms, and Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from an elementary calculation of super Lie group elements associating with non(anti)-commutative Grassmann parameters, we derive several closed expressions of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula which represent multiplication properties of super Lie group elements in the corresponding superspace. We then show that parametrization of superspace in general may become infinite dimensional due to the presence of non(anti)commutativity. We show that a Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted SUSY Algebra (also referred to as Marcus B-type Twisted SUSY Algebra or Geometric Langlands Twisted SUSY Algebra) with a certain type of deformation, which we call an exponential deformation, may circumvent this problem. We also provide, in terms of gauge covariantization of the SUSY algebra, a geometric understanding of the exponential deformation, and see that the framework constructed in this paper may serve as a non(anti)commutative superspace framework providing the gauge covariant link formulation of twisted super Yang-Mills on a lattice.</description>
