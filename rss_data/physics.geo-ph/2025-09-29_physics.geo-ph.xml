      <title>Seismic Velocity Inversion from Multi-Source Shot Gathers Using Deep Segmentation Networks: Benchmarking U-Net Variants and SeismoLabV3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \&amp; Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>Hourglass: an unpublished map projection by John P. Snyder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hourglass is an equal-area pseudocylindrical map projection developed by John P. Snyder in mid 1940s. It was never published in a detailed way by its author, and only a couple of references exist in literature since 1991, both of them including a picture but without any mathematical description. In this work the equations for the ellipsoid and for the sphere are derived, both for direct and inverse problems, together with a generalization that allow meridians not restricted to straight lines as in the original Snyder's version. Although not useful for world maps, the projection can be employed for mapping areas around their standard parallels.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>The influence of grain crushing and pore collapse on the formation of faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an earthquake, slip occurs in a localised shear zone that features a heavily granulated fault core that can be characterised as a shear band. We study the formation of this fault core in a granular rock such as sandstone by developing a model of crushable granular media within the framework of Breakage Mechanics. This model accounts for the evolution of the grain size distribution, while also accounting for the co-evolution of the solid fraction. An enrichment with the Cosserat continuum allows for the model to predict finite-width shear bands. The model is then calibrated against experimental data taken from tests on Bentheim sandstone, and a parametric study of the mechanical parameters is conducted using linear stability analysis. We find that for deeply-buried rocks the shear bands have a compactive component, and the initial value of the solid fraction does not play a strong role in the initial band thickness, but can influence the rate of delocalisation of the band. Post-localisation behaviour is studied with the finite element method, which shows the formation of zones of dilation outside the band in addition to the compaction within the band. Using a modified Kozeny--Carman permeability law, it is shown that within the band the permeability reduces by several orders of magnitude, but can increase outside the band. Our results highlight the importance of modelling grain size and solid fraction evolution as they exert a controlling influence on hydromechanical properties that play an important role in fault formation and seismic slip.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Mathematical Modeling of Transient Fluid Flow in Subsurface Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.</description>

      <title>RED-DiffEq: Regularization by denoising diffusion models for solving inverse PDE problems with application to full waveform inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Model Training, Data Assimilation, and Forecast Experiments with a Hybrid Atmospheric Model that Incorporates Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid model combines the physics-based primitive-equations model SPEEDY with a machine learning-based (ML-based) model component, while ERA5 reanalyses provide the presumed true states of the atmosphere. Six-hourly simulated noisy observations are generated for a 30-year ML training period and a one-year testing period. These observations are assimilated with a Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and a 10-day deterministic forecast is also started from each ensemble mean analysis of the testing period. In the first experiment, the physics-based model provides the background ensemble members and the 10-day deterministic forecasts. In the other three experiments, the hybrid model plays the same role as the physics-based model in the first experiment, but it is trained on a different data set in each experiment. These training data sets are analyses obtained by using the physics-based model (second experiment), the hybrid model of the previous experiment (third experiment), and for comparison, ERA5 reanalyses (fourth experiment). The results of the experiments show that hybridizing the model can substantially improve the accuracy of the analyses and forecasts. When the model is trained on ERA5 reanalyses, the biases of the analyses are negligible and the magnitude of the flow-dependent part of the analysis errors is greatly reduced. While the gains in analysis accuracy are distinctly more modest in the other two hybrid model experiments, the gains in forecast accuracy tend to be larger in those experiments after 1-3 forecast days. However, these extra gains of forecast accuracy are achieved, in part, by a modest gradual reduction of the spatial variability of the forecasts.</description>

      <title>Observations of high-frequency spectral peaks from in-situ waves in ice data: evidence for nonlinear waves in ice triad interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19034v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.</description>
