      <title>Towards the classification of Fano 4-folds with $b_2\geq 7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (smooth, complex) Fano 4-folds X with Picard number rho(X)&gt;6. We show that if rho(X)&gt;9, then X is a product of del Pezzo surfaces, thus improving recent results by the author and by the author and S.A. Secci; the statement is now optimal. In the range rho(X)=7,8,9 we show that if X is not a product of surfaces, and has no small elementary contraction, then it is the blow-up of a cubic 4-fold along a special configuration of planes. When instead rho(X)&gt;6 and X has a small elementary contraction, we study X depending on its fixed prime divisors, giving explicit results on the geometry of X in the framework of birational geometry. In particular for the boundary case rho(X)=9 we show that either X is a product of surfaces, or X belongs to two explicit families, or there is a sequence of flips X--&gt;X' where X' is a smooth projective 4-fold with an elementary contraction onto a 3-fold. In the paper we also give several results on rational contractions of fiber type of Fano 4-folds, and more generally of Mori dream spaces; in particular we use some properties of del Pezzo surfaces over non-closed fields, applied to generic fibers.</description>

      <title>Gerbes for trigonalizable group schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that smooth, separated Deligne--Mumford stacks in mixed characteristic with quasi-projective coarse moduli space are global quotient stacks and satisfy the resolution property. This builds on work of Kresch and Vistoli and of Bragg, Hall, and Matthur which proves the case when the stack is over a base field, as well as work of Gabber and de Jong which proves the same holds for a $\mu_n$-gerbe over a scheme with an ample line bundle. The key technical input is a result that gerbes banded by so-called trigonalizable group schemes admit faithful vector bundles and are quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>On pluricanonical boundedness of varieties of general type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new proof of a theorem of Chen and Jiang: for any integer $n&gt;1$, there is a constant $K_n&gt;0$ such that every smooth projective $n$-fold $X$ with $\operatorname{vol}(X)&gt;K_n$ has either the stable birational $2$-canonical map or a M$^c$Kernan fibration. This amends a gap in the original proof of Theorem 6.8 (at page 2078) in Annales de l'Institut Fourier, volume 67 (2017). As a direct application of our method, we improve a former boundedness theorem of Lascini and prove that for any integer $r&gt;1$ and $n\geq 1$, $r$-canonical maps of $n$-folds of general type have birationally bounded fibers.</description>

      <title>Completions of complexes of differential modules on singular schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spencer cohomology is a cohomology theory consisting of a chain complex of modules over the ring of differential operators of a smooth analytic space. In this paper we give a generalisation of Spencer cohomology suitable for singular schemes of finite type over a field. Our motivation was a conjecture of Vinogradov concerning the homological properties of differential operators on singular affine varieties; namely that certain complexes of such operators are acyclic if and only if the variety is smooth. We will provide a negative answer to Vinogradov's conjecture as stated. In principle Vinogradov's conjecture can also be posed for the Spencer complex; however the answer is trivial, since singularities prohibit a definition of Spencer cohomology with any good properties. Our main result will be the construction of a Spencer complex on a large class of singular schemes which is suitable as a cohomology theory for the space. Following this we are able to ask the same question as Vinogradov in this case, where we give a more positive answer. Our main technique draws from Hartshorne's construction of de Rham cohomology by formal completion.</description>

      <title>Local inequalities for $cA_k$ singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize an intersection-theoretic local inequality of Fulton-Lazarsfeld to weighted blowups. As a consequence, we obtain the $4n^2/(k+1)$-inequality for isolated $cA_k$ singularities, an analogue of the $4 n^2$-inequality for smooth points. We use this to prove birational rigidity of many families of Fano 3-fold weighted complete intersections with terminal quotient singularities and isolated $cA_k$ singularities, including sextic double solids with $cA_1$ and ordinary $cA_2$ points.</description>

      <title>The Iarrobino scheme: a self-dual analogue of the Hilbert scheme of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed quasi-projective scheme $X$ we introduce a self-dual analogue of ${\mathrm{Hilb}}_d(X)$ which we call the Iarrobino scheme of $X$. It is a fine moduli space of oriented Gorenstein zero-dimensional subschemes of $X$ together with some additional data (a self-dual filtration) which is vacuous over a big open set but non-trivial over the compactification. Via the link between Hilbert schemes and varieties of commuting matrices, Iarrobino schemes correspond to commuting symmetric matrices.
  We provide also self-dual analogues of the Quot scheme of points and of the stacks of coherent sheaves and finite algebras. A crucial role in the construction is played by the variety of completed quadrics. We prove that the resulting analogues of Hilbert and Quot schemes are smooth for $X$ a smooth curve and that they have very rich geometry. We give applications, in particular to deformation theory of (usual) Hilbert schemes of points on threefolds, and to enumerative geometry \`a la June Huh.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the 1978 Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture regarding the maximum singularity of $\mathcal{H}=\mathrm{Hilb}^{l}(\mathbb{A}^3)$, where $l$ is a tetrahedral number, by refining the work of Ramkumar-Sammartano in \cite{Ramkumar-Sammartano}. This also immediately implies the conjectural necessary condition for a point of $\mathcal{H}$ to have the maximal singularity, suggested by the second-named author in \cite{Rezaee-23-Conjectures}. In a sequel to this article, \cite{Mackenzie-Rezaee2}, we prove a generalized version of this conjecture for certain non-tetrahedral $l$, via proving the conjectural necessary condition.</description>

      <title>Generation of Grothendieck topologies, provability and operations on subtoposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After reviewing the multiple roles of toposes - as generalized topological spaces, as universal invariants, as categorical analogues of the set-theoretic universe, and as semantic environments for first-order theories - we recall the notion of subtopos and its dual expression: both in terms of Grothendieck topologies and in terms of first-order logic. We emphasize the significance of this duality, which enables the translation of provability problems in first-order logic into problems concerning the generation of Grothendieck topologies. We also introduce the natural geometric operations, both inner and outer, on subtoposes.
  Building on these foundations, we present a new formulation of the duality between Grothendieck topologies and subtoposes, as well as the duality between topologies and closedness properties of subpresheaves. This presentation relies on general categorical principles and aims to clarify the structural relationships involved.
  We then provide two general formulas for the Grothendieck topology generated by an arbitrary family of sieves or covering families of morphisms. In addition, we refine the constructive procedures that translate logical provability into topology generation, highlighting their role in bridging logic and geometry within the topos-theoretic framework.
  Finally, we study the inner geometric operations on subtoposes: union, intersection, and difference, along with the outer adjoint operations of pushforward and pullback along topos morphisms. We prove that pullback operations preserve not only arbitrary intersections but also finite unions of subtoposes, and that pullbacks along locally connected morphisms even preserve arbitrary unions.</description>

      <title>Sites and Grothendieck toposes: an introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topos theory occupies a singular place in contemporary mathematics: born from Grothendieck's algebraic geometry, it has emerged as a unifying language for geometry, topology, algebra, and logic. This book offers a progressive introduction that moves from familiar ground - groups and their actions, topological spaces, categories, and sheaves - to Grothendieck topologies and sites, then to the axiomatic and categorical foundations of toposes (via Giraud's theorem), to their geometry (morphisms, points, subtoposes, localizations) and finally to their deep ties with geometric logic through classifying toposes. Aimed at readers with a basic familiarity with algebra, general topology, and category theory, the book emphasizes reversible viewpoints - external/internal, local/global, syntactic/semantic - guided by canonical examples, key theorems, and universal constructions. It equips the reader with a workable language in which spaces become categories of sheaves and theories become places classified by toposes. Future chapters will present "toposes as bridges" and relative toposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate border ranks of twisted powers of polynomials and smoothability of symmetric powers of algebras. We prove that the latter are smoothable. For the former, we obtain upper bounds for the border rank in general and prove that they are optimal under mild conditions. We give applications to complexity theory. Many of the results rest on the notion of an encompassing polynomial, which we introduce.</description>

Abstract: We prove many new cases of a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton describing the qualitative properties of completed cohomology. The heart of our argument is a careful inductive analysis of completed cohomology on the Borel-Serre boundary. As a key input to this induction, we prove a new perfectoidness result for towers of minimally compactified Shimura varieties of pre-abelian type, generalizing previous work of Scholze.</description>

      <title>Density of solutions for systems of forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant, improving vastly on the astronomical bound coming from their proof. Our result has applications for surjectivity of polynomial maps and for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.</description>
