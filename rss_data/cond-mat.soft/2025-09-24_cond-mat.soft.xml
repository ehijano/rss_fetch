      <title>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrimers are an emerging class of crosslinked polymer networks in which dynamic covalent bonds can exchange and rearrange, without any significant change in population of bonded states.1 Because these bonds can rearrange at high temperatures without disintegration of the network, vitrimers could combine the mechanical stability of traditional permanently crosslinked networks with the recyclability of glasses and physical networks. However, unlike classical transient/physical networks, vitrimers can relax at a rate that is decoupled from the mobility of their polymer segments. This challenges our fundamental understanding of how dynamic covalent networks relax and deform. Here we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to show that vitrimer dynamics exhibit two very different regimes: (i) a high temperature regime controlled by the local bond-exchange reaction rate and (ii) a low temperature regime controlled by segmental diffusion. This fundamental difference from traditional physical networks explains why vitrimers can exhibit Arrhenius dynamics, providing a foundation for their rational design.</description>

      <title>Conservative yet constitutively odd elasticity in prestressed metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a design principle for mechanical metamaterials based on "odd elasticity, once removed." By revisiting classic results relating the variation of Cauchy stress and Lagrangian strain around a prestressed reference state, we show how anisotropic, equilibrium prestress can generate a major anti-symmetry in the material's constitutive response. Tuning the system to such a state drives it to a critical instability, radically transforming its acoustic properties. We then inverse-design several uniform 2D solids that act as unique waveguides supporting decoupled modes along special lattice directions: a string-like mode and an exotic, in-plane soft mode with a flexural character ($\omega \sim q^2$). The soft modes are insensitive to the value of the anisotropic prestress and exhibit oscillating momentum density but support a non-oscillatory, constant energy current. This principle of harnessing conservative "oddness" to unlock instability-driven wave phenomena provides a powerful new route to creating tunable materials for filtering, guiding, and controlling mechanical waves.</description>

      <title>Smart copolymer microgels with high volume phase transition temperature: Composition, swelling, and morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermosensitivity and microstructure of microgels made by copolymerizing standard microgel-forming monomers with more hydrophilic comonomers is investigated, with the aim of increasing the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). We precisely determine the incorporation of N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (HMAM) and purpose-synthesized N-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)acrylamide (HIPAM) into microgels -- neither of which forms microgels on its own by precipitation polymerization. The swelling properties and microstructure of the resulting copolymer microgels with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, LCST ca. 32{\deg}C) and N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAM, LCST ca. 44{\deg}C) are then characterized via turbidimetry, DLS, and AFM. At low comonomer contents, all microgel particles exhibit moderate growth in size. Beyond a system-specific threshold, we observe a significant jump in size, and smoother swelling behavior. For NIPAM-HIPAM, the size increase is linked to a strong rise in swelling capacity, and the formation of a thick corona. The effect of the hydrophilic comonomers on the VPTT correlates linearly with their true composition, allowing us to extrapolate the VPTT of hypothetical pure HMAM and HIPAM microgels. This leads to 99{\deg}C for HMAM, and 68{\deg}C for HIPAM for the respective VPTT. These numbers can be seen as useful indicators of the effect of these monomers on the VPTT in the copolymerized microgels. The observed changes in VPTT, swelling, size, and morphology suggest that high-VPTT microgels possess unique internal molecular composition gradients, likely due to hydrophobic interactions during synthesis. Our results have potential implications for developing temperature-sensitive microgel-based membranes that can self-adapt their permeability at higher operating temperatures in energy applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic self-assembly of active particle systems controlled by light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particle systems are a class of non-equilibrium systems composed of self-propelled Brownian particles; through interactions between particles within the system, a variety of intriguing collective behaviors can emerge. Based on Brownian dynamics simulations, this study investigates the formation and transition mechanisms of ordered structures in active particle systems regulated by light fields. The study reveals that, under light field regulation, active particles undergo large-scale phase separation behavior, forming specific ordered structures and enabling the dynamic transition between multiple ordered structures. This study systematically explores the effects of light fields on this dynamic phase transition and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. The research findings provide important references for the precise regulation of collective structures in active systems and the fabrication of micro-nano intelligent devices.</description>

      <title>Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in two-dimensional ring polymers: size versus stiffness polydispersity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft glassy materials often consist of deformable objects. Here, we use a two-dimensional assembly of semi-flexible ring polymers as a model system to investigate how polydispersity in particle stiffness or size influences the onset of glassy dynamics. In simulations at fixed polydispersity 30%, we find that stiffness dispersity drives most rings into elongated conformations at high densities, leading to orientationally ordered structures that cause dynamical slowing down. In contrast, size dispersity generates a bimodal population: small rings remain circular and act as rigid inclusions, while large rings elongate, producing frustration that delays arrest. Real-space maps of bond relaxation reveal strikingly different pathways of dynamical heterogeneity, with long-lived domains persisting under stiffness dispersity but rapidly percolating relaxation under size dispersity. Moreover, local correlations between ring shape, orientational order, and mobility show that stiffness dispersity produces dynamics that are strongly structure-sensitive, whereas size dispersity activates motion from both circular and elongated populations. By linking microscopic deformability to emergent glassy dynamics, this study identifies how the nature of polydispersity controls the relaxation pathways of soft glasses.</description>

      <title>Quantitative description of the surface tension minimum in a two-component surfactant system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbs adsorption equation is the thermodynamic cornerstone for the description and understanding of the surface tension in a surfactant solution. It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.</description>

      <title>Lateral disorder in Langmuir monolayers: theoretical derivations and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.</description>

      <title>Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic shrinkage and finite strains in confined frictional contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, adhesion, contact geometry, and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layer substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.</description>

      <title>Pressure shifts in large-amplitude pulsatile shear flow: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We demonstrate that such a feedback is compatible with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.</description>

      <title>Entropic Clustering of Stickers Induces Aging in Biocondensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as aging.The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Critical surface phase behavior governs hydrophobic attraction between extended solutes</title>

Abstract: Hydrophobic interactions are central to biological self-assembly and soft matter organization, yet their microscopic origins remain debated. A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the SPCE water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor-liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.</description>

      <title>Computing dielectric spectra in molecular dynamics simulations: using a cavity to disentangle self and cross correlations</title>

Abstract: Dielectric spectra are typically obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by analyzing the fluctuations, in the absence of an applied electric field, of the total dipole moment of the simulation box. We compare this standard method with a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross-correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.</description>

      <title>Particle-scale origin of quadrupolar non-affine displacement fields in granular solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Static Contact Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.</description>

      <title>Competing Supramolecular Structures: Dielectric and Rheological Spectroscopy on Glycerol/Propanol Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the dynamics of pure hydrogen-bonded systems by analyzing the spectral shape of various susceptibilities. Monohydroxy- and polyalcohols are currently considered to form transient supramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures in the form of chains, rings, and networks. This complex dynamic behavior has been identified in network-forming glycerol and chain-forming propanol by combining dielectric and light-scattering spectra. We apply these concepts to study the combined dielectric and shear rheological spectral shape of glycerol/propanol mixtures. Glycerol differs from propanol by having two additional hydroxy groups, which leads to significant differences in melting temperatures($\Delta T_{\textbf{m}}$\,=\,291\,K\,-\,147\,K\,=\,143\,K) and glass transition temperatures ($\Delta T_{\textbf{g}}$\,=\,190\,K-\,98\,K\,=\,92\,K). The strong difference results in two distinct calorimetric glass transitions at a molar glycerol concentration of $\chi_{gly}=0.3$, as well as a change in the shear modulus $G_{\infty}$ between $\chi_{gly}=0.5$ and 0.7. Performing a comprehensive analysis of the three applied experimental techniques leads to the conclusion that dielectric spectroscopy monitors the evolution of supramolecular chain and network structures and that the mechanical properties depend heavily on the formed hydrogen-bonded network. A strong dynamical heterogeneity is observed and manifests itself in two distinguishable glass transitions in dielectric spectroscopy and calorimetry. The presented chain/network mixture is dynamically highly heterogeneous when compared to the rather narrow dynamical heterogeneity in the network/network mixture Water/Glycerol.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>
