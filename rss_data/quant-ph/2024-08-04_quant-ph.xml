      <title>Optimizing quantum error correction protocols with erasure qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasure qubits offer a promising avenue toward reducing the overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. However, they require additional operations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase runtime of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we focus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In particular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable regions in the phase space of error parameters and probe the subthreshold scaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure qubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We use the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the performance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure qubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the absence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.</description>

      <title>Classification of joint quantum measurements based on entanglement cost of localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their importance in quantum theory, joint quantum measurements remain poorly understood. An intriguing conceptual and practical question is whether joint quantum measurements on separated systems can be performed without bringing them together. Remarkably, by using shared entanglement, this can be achieved perfectly when disregarding the post-measurement state. However, existing localization protocols typically require unbounded entanglement. In this work, we address the fundamental question: "Which joint measurements can be localized with a finite amount of entanglement?" We develop finite-resource versions of teleportation-based schemes and analytically classify all two-qubit measurements that can be localized in the first steps of these hierarchies. These include several measurements with exceptional properties and symmetries, such as the Bell state measurement and the elegant joint measurement. This leads us to propose a systematic classification of joint measurements based on entanglement cost, which we argue directly connects to the complexity of implementing those measurements. We illustrate how to numerically explore higher levels and construct generalizations to higher dimensions and multipartite settings.</description>

      <title>Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Surface Code with Imperfect Erasure Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a lot of effort has been devoted towards designing erasure qubits in which dominant physical noise excites leakage states whose population can be detected and returned to the qubit subspace. Interest in these erasure qubits has been driven by studies showing that the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum error correction are significantly relaxed when noise in every gate operation is dominated by erasures. However, these studies assume perfectly accurate erasure checks after every gate operation which generally come with undesirable time and hardware overhead costs. In this work, we investigate the consequences of using an imperfect but overhead-efficient erasure check for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the surface code. We show that, under physically reasonable assumptions on the imperfect erasure checks, the threshold error rate is still at least over twice that for Pauli noise. We also study the impact of imperfect erasure checks on the effective error distance and find that it degrades the effective distance under a general error model in which a qubit suffers from depolarizing noise when interacting with a leaked qubit. We then identify a more restrictive but realistic noise model for a qubit that interacts with a leaked qubit, under which the effective error distance is twice that for Pauli noise. We apply our analysis to recently proposed superconducting dual-rail erasure qubits and show that achieving good performance surface code quantum memories with relaxed system requirements is possible.</description>

      <title>Improving entanglement purification through coherent superposition of roles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement purification and distillation protocols are essential for harnessing the full potential of quantum communication technologies. Multiple strategies have been proposed to approach and optimize such protocols, most however restricted to Clifford operations. In this paper, we introduce a novel superposed entanglement purification design strategy, leveraging coherent superpositions of the roles of entangled states to enhance purification efficiency. We demonstrate how this approach can be hierarchically integrated with existing entanglement purification strategies, consistently improving protocols performance.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the average Petz map infidelity sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that the Petz map fidelity is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mitigation of measurement errors in multi-qubit experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an implementation of Bayesian measurement error mitigation tailored for multiqubit experiments on near-term quantum devices. Our approach leverages complete information from the readout signal, which is available before any binary state assignment of the qubits. We provide a detailed algorithm workflow, from the calibration of detector response functions to the post-processing of measurement outcomes, offering a computationally efficient solution suitable for the output size typical of current quantum computing devices and quantum algorithms. We benchmark our protocol on actual quantum computers with superconducting qubits, where the readout signal encodes the measurement information in the IQ clouds before qubit state assignment. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against other measurement error mitigation methods, such as iterative Bayesian unfolding and noise matrix inversion.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points in SSH-like models with hopping amplitude gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) system is a popular model for exploring topological insulators and topological phases in one dimension. Recent interest in exceptional points has led to re-examination of non-Hermitian generalizations of many physical models, including the SSH model. In such non-Hermitian systems, singular points called exceptional points (EPs) appear that are of interest for applications in super-resolution sensing systems and topological lasers. Here, a non-Hermitian and non-PT-symmetric variation of the SSH model is introduced, in which the hopping amplitudes are non-reciprocal and vary monotonically along the chain. It is found that, while the existence of the EPs is due to the nonreciprocal couplings, the number, position, and order of the EPs can all be altered by the addition of the hopping amplitude gradient, adding a new tool for tailoring the spectrum of a non-Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the Potential of Adaptive LMS Filtering on FPGA-Based Qubit Control Platforms for Improved Qubit Readout in 2D and 3D Quantum Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing underscore the critical need for sophisticated qubit readout techniques to accurately discern quantum states. This abstract presents our research intended for optimizing readout pulse fidelity for 2D and 3D Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), the latter coupled with Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities. Focusing specifically on the application of the Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm, we explore its integration into the FPGA-based control systems to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of qubit state detection by improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Implementing the LMS algorithm on the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC Gen 3 devices (RFSoC 4x2 FPGA and ZCU216 FPGA) using the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK) open-source platform, we aim to dynamically test and adjust the filtering parameters in real-time to characterize and adapt to the noise profile presented in quantum computing readout signals. Our preliminary results demonstrate the LMS filter's capability to maintain high readout accuracy while efficiently managing FPGA resources. These findings are expected to contribute to developing more reliable and scalable quantum computing architectures, highlighting the pivotal role of adaptive signal processing in quantum technology advancements.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient and Reduced Depth Approximate Adders for NISQ Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Noisy intermediate-scale quantum" NISQ machine era primarily focuses on mitigating noise, controlling errors, and executing high-fidelity operations, hence requiring shallow circuit depth and noise robustness. Approximate computing is a novel computing paradigm that produces imprecise results by relaxing the need for fully precise output for error-tolerant applications including multimedia, data mining, and image processing. We investigate how approximate computing can improve the noise resilience of quantum adder circuits in NISQ quantum computing. We propose five designs of approximate quantum adders to reduce depth while making them noise-resilient, in which three designs are with carryout, while two are without carryout. We have used novel design approaches that include approximating the Sum only from the inputs (pass-through designs) and having zero depth, as they need no quantum gates. The second design style uses a single CNOT gate to approximate the SUM with a constant depth of O(1). We performed our experimentation on IBM Qiskit on noise models including thermal, depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, and bitflip: (i) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder without carryout the proposed approximate adders without carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.34% to 219.22%, and (ii) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder with carryout the proposed approximate adders with carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.23% to 371%. Further, the proposed approximate quantum adders are evaluated in terms of various error metrics.</description>

      <title>Chaos destroys the excited state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Multi-controlled single-qubit unitary gates based on the quantum Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-controlled (MC) special unitary (U) gates are widely used in quantum algorithms and circuits. Few state-of-the-art decompositions of MCU gates use non-elementary $C-R_x$ and $C-U^{1/2^{m-1}}$ gates resulting in a linear function for the depths of an implemented circuit on the number of these gates. Our approach is based on two generalizations of the multi-controlled X (MCX) gate that uses the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) comprised of Hadamard and controlled-phase gates. For the native gate set used in a genuine quantum computer, the decomposition of the controlled-phase gate is twice as less complex as $C-R_x$, which can result in an approximately double advantage of circuits derived from the QFT. The first generalization is based on altering the controlled gates acting on the target qubit. These gates are the most complex and are also used in the state-of-the-art circuits. Our circuit uses half the number of elementary gates compared to the most efficient one, potentially resulting in a smaller error. However, the advantage in time complexity is not twofold, as it was in MCX gates. The second generalization relies on the ZYZ decomposition and uses only one QFT-based circuit to implement the two multi-controlled X gates needed for the decomposition. Since the complexities of this circuit are approximately equal to the QFT-based MCX, our MCU implementation is more advanced than any known existing. The supremacy over the best-known optimized algorithm will be demonstrated by comparing transpiled circuits assembled for execution in a genuine quantum device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent storage of quantum information is crucial to many quantum technologies. Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion qubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a single ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable states could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing, such as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species system and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states of a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same species and constantly monitoring for erasure errors, we demonstrate a coherence time of 136(42) seconds with a qubit encoded in the metastable $5D_{5/2}$ state of a single $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ion. In agreement with a model based on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, we find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error once erasure errors are removed.</description>

      <title>A Logarithmic Depth Quantum Carry-Lookahead Modulo $(2^n-1)$ Adder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing is making significant advancements toward creating machines capable of implementing quantum algorithms in various fields, such as quantum cryptography, quantum image processing, and optimization. The development of quantum arithmetic circuits for modulo addition is vital for implementing these quantum algorithms. While it is ideal to use quantum circuits based on fault-tolerant gates to overcome noise and decoherence errors, the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers cannot handle the additional computational cost associated with fault-tolerant designs. Our research aims to minimize circuit depth, which can reduce noise and facilitate the implementation of quantum modulo addition circuits on NISQ machines. This work presents quantum carry-lookahead modulo $(2^n - 1)$ adder (QCLMA), which is designed to receive two n-bit numbers and perform their addition with an O(log n) depth. Compared to existing work of O(n) depth, our proposed QCLMA reduces the depth and helps increase the noise fidelity. In order to increase error resilience, we also focus on creating a tree structure based Carry path, unlike the chain based Carry path of the current work. We run experiments on Quantum Computer IBM Cairo to evaluate the performance of the proposed QCLMA against the existing work and define Quantum State Fidelity Ratio (QSFR) to quantify the closeness of the correct output to the top output. When compared against existing work, the proposed QCLMA achieves a 47.21% increase in QSFR for 4-qubit modulo addition showcasing its superior noise fidelity.</description>

      <title>CALA-$n$: A Quantum Library for Realizing Cost-Effective 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-bit Gates on IBM Quantum Computers using Bloch Sphere Approach, Clifford+T Gates, and Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantum layout-aware approach to realize cost-effective $n$-bit gates using the Bloch sphere, for $2 \le n \le 5$ qubits. These $n$-bit gates are entirely constructed from the Clifford+T gates, in the approach of selecting sequences of rotations visualized on the Bloch sphere. This Bloch sphere approach ensures to match the quantum layout for synthesizing (transpiling) these $n$-bit gates into an IBM quantum computer. Various standard $n$-bit gates (Toffoli, Fredkin, etc.) and their operational equivalent of our proposed $n$-bit gates are examined and evaluated, in the context of the final quantum costs, as the final counts of generated IBM native gates. In this paper, we demonstrate that all our $n$-bit gates always have lower quantum costs than those of standard $n$-bit gates after transpilation. Hence, our Bloch sphere approach can be used to build a quantum library of various cost-effective $n$-bit gates for different layouts of IBM quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Parameterized Quantum Circuits: on The Connection Between Expressibility and Types of Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressibility is a crucial factor of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) based Quantum Machine Learning (QML), a QML model composed of highly expressible PQC and sufficient number of qubits is theoretically capable of approximating any arbitrary continuous function. While much research has explored the relationship between expressibility and learning performance, as well as the number of layers in PQCs, the connection between expressibility and PQC structure has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we analyze the connection between expressibility and the types of quantum gates within PQCs using a Gradient Boosting Tree model and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Our analysis is performed on 1,615 instances of PQC derived from 19 PQC topologies, each with 2-18 qubits and 1-5 layers. The findings of our analysis provide guidance for designing highly expressible PQCs, suggesting the integration of more RX or RY gates while maintaining a careful balance with the number of CNOT gates. Furthermore, our evaluation offers an additional evidence of expressibility saturation, as observed by previous studies.</description>

      <title>Solving Caldeira-Leggett Model by Inchworm Method with Frozen Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm that combines the inchworm method and the frozen Gaussian approximation to simulate the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is coupled with thermal harmonic baths. In particular, we are interested in the real-time dynamics of the reduced density operator. In our algorithm, we use frozen Gaussian approximation to approximate the wave function as a wave packet in integral form. The desired reduced density operator is then written as a Dyson series, which is the series expression of path integrals in quantum mechanics of interacting systems. To compute the Dyson series, we further approximate each term in the series using Gaussian wave packets, and then employ the idea of the inchworm method to accelerate the convergence of the series. The inchworm method formulates the series as an integro-differential equation of "full propagators", and rewrites the infinite series on the right-hand side using these full propagators, so that the number of terms in the sum can be significantly reduced, and faster convergence can be achieved. The performance of our algorithm is verified numerically by various experiments.</description>

      <title>Encoded-Fusion-Based Quantum Computation for High Thresholds with Linear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme in a measurement-based manner with finite-sized entangled resource states and encoded fusion scheme with linear optics. The encoded-fusion is an entangled measurement devised to enhance the fusion success probability in the presence of losses and errors based on a quantum error-correcting code. We apply an encoded-fusion scheme, which can be performed with linear optics and active feedforwards to implement the generalized Shor code, to construct a fault-tolerant network configuration in a three-dimensional Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal lattice based on the surface code. Numerical simulations show that our scheme allows us to achieve up to 10 times higher loss thresholds than nonencoded fusion approaches with limited numbers of photons used in fusion. Our scheme paves an efficient route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing with finite-sized entangled resource states and linear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerations of high energies in quantum field theories on smooth manifolds have led to generalized uncertainty principles and the possibility of a physical minimal length in quantum gravitational scenarios. In these models, the minimal length would be a physical limit, not just a mathematical tool, and should be Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we study two-qubit communication and entanglement harvesting in a field subject to a covariant bandlimit (minimum length) and present the changes induced by this bandlimit. We find the bandlimit introduces nonlocality and acausal communication in a manner unlike non-covariant bandlimits or other quantum optical approximations. We also observe that this covariant bandlimit introduces uncertainties in time and temporal ordering with the unusual behavior attributed to the behavior of virtual particles being modified by the covariant cutoff.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Holes in Quadratic Bosonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of electron holes plays a significant role in condensed matter physics. Here we develop the concept of bosonic holes, which exhibit negative particle excitations, in quadratic bosonic systems. Unlike electron holes, the Fock states of bosonic holes are biorthogonal, and their excitation can be interpreted as removing particles from a mean-particle number with a mean field background. Furthermore, we find that quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians related by non unitary and local particle hole transformation possess the same locality structure and spectral properties in different spaces, reflecting the PH duality. Based on this, we study the generation of PH entanglement in two mode cases and the PH Aharonov Bohm effect in the three mode case, which results in a PH chiral flow with time reversal symmetry breaking. Our findings provide a new way to understand and explore unusual physical phenomena in particle non conserving and non Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can manifest rich static and dynamical properties at their exceptional points (EPs). Here, we identify yet another class of distinct phenomena that is hinged on EPs, namely, the emergence of a series of non-Hermitian conservation laws. We demonstrate these distinct phenomena concretely in the non-Hermitian Heisenberg chain and formulate a general theory for identifying these emergent non-Hermitian conservation laws at EPs. By establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the constant of motions at EPs and those in corresponding auxiliary Hermitian systems, we trace their physical origin back to the presence of emergent symmetries in the auxiliary systems. Concrete simulations on quantum circuits show that these emergent conserved dynamics can be readily observed in current digital quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work we have derived an analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator using a path integral formalism. Quite remarkably, the free energy was found to be accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and quartic coupling constant. In addition, the key features of the exact partition function were successfully reproduced. Accurate analytic expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies as function of $g$ were derived. In this work, we extend our results to the calculation of the full energy spectrum. We also generalize our study of the quartic oscillator to the case of the anharmonic oscillator with sextic and octic couplings. The energy levels found are accurate for all couplings and principal quantum numbers considered here (up to $n=8$), confirming this model partition function as a good and faithful approximation of the exact one.</description>

      <title>Information transfer by entangled photons without auxiliary non-quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the faster than light communication possibility based on entangled photons. We analyze designs that may be capable to solve the problem of direct information transfer between members of an entangled photon pairs. We consider that experimental verifications can confirm or even refute this. Our hypothesis was that most proofs of the nocommunication theorem are based on a certain set of conditions, and it is possible to provide a broader set of conditions that allow the establishment of entangled states as quantum information channels, without using a classical channel. One basic unit of the proposed design transforms the polarization state of one member of an entangled photon pair into a spatial superposition state. Thus, after the polarization measurement performed on one member, which eliminates the entanglement, the quantum information is maintained in the spatial superposition state of the other member. This can be recovered by a particular measurement based on spatial interference. We have shown that solutions with so-called symmetric functions lead to average results that corresponds to the nocommunication theorem. However, using asymmetric functions the averaged measurement results calculated in a prescribed time window can distinguish the types of measurements performed on the other member of the pair. This can establish a communication code that enables faster-than-light information sharing under specific conditions. There may be also further theoretical consequences: a significant extension of the quantum mechanical nonlocality principle.</description>

      <title>Deterministic multipartite entanglement via fractional state transfer across quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of entanglement across different nodes in distributed quantum architectures plays a pivotal role for different applications. In particular, deterministic, robust, and fast protocols that prepare genuine multipartite entangled states are highly desirable. In this article, we propose a fractional quantum state transfer, in which the excitation of an emitter is partially transmitted through the quantum communication channel and then absorbed at a spatially separated node. This protocol is based on wavepacket shaping allowing for a fast deterministic generation of Bell states among two quantum registers and $W$ states for a general setting of $N$ qubits, either in a sequential or simultaneous fashion, depending on the topology of the network. By means of detailed numerical simulations, we show that genuine multipartite entangled states can be faithfully prepared within current experimental platforms and discuss the role of the main decoherence sources, qubit dephasing and relaxation, depending on the network topology.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Variational Quantum Circuits Using Metaheuristic Strategies in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) offers potential advantages over classical Reinforcement Learning, such as compact state space representation and faster convergence in certain scenarios. However, practical benefits require further validation. QRL faces challenges like flat solution landscapes, where traditional gradient-based methods are inefficient, necessitating the use of gradient-free algorithms. This work explores the integration of metaheuristic algorithms -- Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Harmony Search -- into QRL. These algorithms provide flexibility and efficiency in parameter optimization. Evaluations in $5\times5$ MiniGrid Reinforcement Learning environments show that, all algorithms yield near-optimal results, with Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization performing best. In the Cart Pole environment, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization achieve optimal results, while the others perform slightly better than random action selection. These findings demonstrate the potential of Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing for efficient QRL learning, emphasizing the need for careful algorithm selection and adaptation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning uses principles from quantum mechanics to process data, offering potential advances in speed and performance. However, previous work has shown that these models are susceptible to attacks that manipulate input data or exploit noise in quantum circuits. Following this, various studies have explored the robustness of these models. These works focus on the robustness certification of manipulations of the quantum states. We extend this line of research by investigating the robustness against perturbations in the classical data for a general class of data encoding schemes. We show that for such schemes, the addition of suitable noise channels is equivalent to evaluating the mean value of the noiseless classifier at the smoothed data, akin to Randomized Smoothing from classical machine learning. Using our general framework, we show that suitable additions of phase-damping noise channels improve empirical and provable robustness for the considered class of encoding schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization of a Levitated Nanoparticle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every massive particle behaves like a wave, according to quantum physics. Yet, this characteristic wave nature has only been observed in double-slit experiments with microscopic systems, such as atoms and molecules. The key aspect is that the wavefunction describing the motion of these systems extends coherently over a distance comparable to the slit separation, much larger than the size of the system itself. Preparing these states of more massive and complex objects remains an outstanding challenge. While the motion of solid-state oscillators can now be controlled at the level of single quanta, their coherence length remains comparable to the zero-point motion, limited to subatomic distances. Here, we prepare a delocalized state of a levitating solid-state nanosphere with coherence length exceeding the zero-point motion. We first cool its motion to the ground state. Then, by modulating the stiffness of the confinement potential, we achieve more than a threefold increment of the initial coherence length with minimal added noise. Optical levitation gives us the necessary control over the confinement that other mechanical platforms lack. Our work is a stepping stone towards the generation of delocalization scales comparable to the object size, a crucial regime for macroscopic quantum experiments, and towards quantum-enhanced force sensing with levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <title>Type-II pumping beyond resonance principle: From energetic to geometric rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, pumping relies on energetic resonance: energy quanta ${\hbar}{\omega}$ matches the gap $\Delta$. Under linear approximation, this is known as the Fermi golden rule (FGR). However, this principle becomes challenging to apply in the "0/0" limit, where ${\omega},{\Delta}{\rightarrow}0$ simultaneously. In "0/0" scenarios, such as topological phase transition (TPT), a type-II pumping, geometric pumping (GP), is recognized subject to geometric rules, distinguished from type-I dictated by FGR. Type-I features an "arrow of energy", sending particles higher in energy, reflected by FGR's dependence on Fermi distribution $f_v-f_c$ (probabilities of valence and conduction bands). While GP is non-directional, its probability relies on $f_v+f_c-2f_v f_c$ instead, a key signature for detection. In this work, we address: (1) the concept of GP; (2) its features of fractionality, irreversibility, and dependence on TPT; (3) experimental detection with ultra-fast spectrum in coherent phonon driving of ZrTe$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing protocols enable the certification of quantum systems in a device-independent manner, i.e. without knowledge of the inner workings of the quantum devices under test. Here, we demonstrate this high standard for characterization routines with superconducting circuits, a prime platform for building large-scale quantum computing systems. We first develop the missing theory allowing for the self-testing of Pauli measurements. We then self-test Bell pair generation and measurements at the same time, performing a complete self-test in a system composed of two entangled superconducting circuits operated at a separation of 30 meters. In an experiment based on 17 million trials, we measure an average CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) S-value of 2.236. Without relying on additional assumptions on the experimental setup, we certify an average Bell state fidelity of at least 58.9% and an average measurement fidelity of at least 89.5% in a device-independent manner, both with 99% confidence. This enables applications in the field of distributed quantum computing and communication with superconducting circuits, such as delegated quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal limits of continuously monitored thermometers and their Hamiltonian structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature of a bosonic/fermionic environment can be measured by coupling a fully characterised $N$-dimensional probe to it. While prepare-measure-reset strategies offer optimal thermometry precision, they overlook the required time for the preparation and reset, and require excessive control of the probe at all times. Continuously monitored probes are more practical in this sense, as they take into account finite-time limitations. Thus, we study the ultimate limits and the optimal structure of continuously monitored $N$-dimensional thermometers. With the local estimation scheme our figure of merit is the Fisher information, which inversely bounds the mean square error. We provide an optimal strategy for both fermionic and bosonic environments. Under reasonable assumptions it turns out that the optimal thermometer is an effective two-level system, with a degeneracy of the ground state that increases with $N$ -- contrary to the optimal thermometers at equilibrium that have a single ground state degeneracy. The optimal gap also differs from the equilibrium case, as it depends on the bath type (fermionic/bosonic) and the specific spectral density. For $N\gg 1$, the Fisher information can grow linearly with $N$ regardless of bath type, significantly improving the well-known $\log^2 N$ scaling for equilibrium thermometry. Another remarkable observation is that the scaling with $N$ does not vanish in presence of prior ignorance, i.e., in a Bayesian setup even non-adaptive strategies can lead to an estimation error that scales with $1/N$. In comparison, a no-go theorem prohibits the ultimate equilibrium scaling $1/\log^2 N$ without adaptive strategies.</description>

      <title>Time-efficient logical operations on quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose schemes capable of measuring an arbitrary set of commutative logical Pauli operators in time independent of the number of operators. The only condition is commutativity, a fundamental requirement for simultaneous measurements in quantum mechanics. Quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes show great promise for realising fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are particularly significant for early fault-tolerant technologies as they can encode many logical qubits using relatively few physical qubits. By achieving simultaneous measurements of logical operators, our approaches enable fully parallelised quantum computing, thus minimising computation time. Our schemes are applicable to any quantum LDPC codes and maintain the low density of parity checks while measuring multiple logical operators simultaneously. These results enhance the feasibility of applying early fault-tolerant technologies to practical problems.</description>

      <title>Device-Independent Certification of Multipartite Distillable Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks consist of various quantum technologies, spread across vast distances, and involve various users at the same time. Certifying the functioning and efficiency of the individual components is a task that is well studied and widely used. However, the power of quantum networks can only be realized by integrating all the required quantum technologies and platforms across a large number of users. In this work, we demonstrate how to certify the distillable entanglement available in multipartite states produced by quantum networks, without relying on the physical realization of its constituent components. We do so by using the paradigm of device independence.</description>

      <title>Minimal operational theories: classical theories with quantum features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic theories where the dynamics of each system is limited to the minimal set of operations consistent with the set of states and allowing for conditional tests. We show that almost all minimal theories with conditioning satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a relevant example, we construct a minimal toy-theory with conditioning where all systems are classical. The theory does not have incompatible measurements nor preparation uncertainty relations, and it is Kochen-Specker noncontextual, and at the same time it exhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. This proves that the latter three properties cannot be understood $per se$ as signatures of non-classicality.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of low-loss Al/Si/Al parallel plate capacitors for superconducting quantum information applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the density of superconducting circuits requires compact components, however, superconductor-based capacitors typically perform worse as dimensions are reduced due to loss at surfaces and interfaces. Here, parallel plate capacitors composed of aluminum-contacted, crystalline silicon fins are shown to be a promising technology for use in superconducting circuits by evaluating the performance of lumped element resonators and transmon qubits. High aspect ratio Si-fin capacitors having widths below $300nm$ with an approximate total height of 3$\mu$m are fabricated using anisotropic wet etching of Si(110) substrates followed by aluminum metallization. The single-crystal Si capacitors are incorporated in lumped element resonators and transmons by shunting them with lithographically patterned aluminum inductors and conventional $Al/AlO_x/Al$ Josephson junctions respectively. Microwave characterization of these devices suggests state-of-the-art performance for superconducting parallel plate capacitors with low power internal quality factor of lumped element resonators greater than 500k and qubit $T_1$ times greater than 25$\mu$s. These results suggest that Si-Fins are a promising technology for applications that require low loss, compact, superconductor-based capacitors with minimal stray capacitance.</description>

      <title>Error correction of transversal controlled-NOT gates for scalable surface code computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have made it possible to implement logical multi-qubit transversal gates on surface codes in a multitude of platforms. A transversal controlled-NOT (tCNOT) gate on two surface codes introduces correlated errors across the code blocks and thus requires modified decoding strategies compared to established methods of decoding surface code quantum memory (SCQM) or lattice surgery operations. In this work, we examine and benchmark the performance of three different decoding strategies for the tCNOT for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, we present a low-complexity decoder based on minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) that achieves the same threshold as the SCQM MWPM decoder. We extend our analysis with a study of tailored decoding of a transversal teleportation circuit, along with a comparison between the performance of lattice surgery and transversal operations under Pauli and erasure noise models. Our investigation works towards systematic estimation of the cost of implementing large-scale quantum algorithms based on transversal gates in the surface code.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swanson oscillator forms a prototypical example of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermitian system with a quadratic Hamiltonian. The system is described by the generic quadratic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\rm Swanson} = \hbar \Omega_0 \big( \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\big) + \alpha \hat{a}^2 + \beta ({\hat{a}^\dagger})^2$, where $\Omega_0 &gt; 0$, $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\alpha \neq \beta$. We show that such a system may be realized as a harmonic oscillator in the presence of an imaginary-valued gauge field. In the position representation, we solve the problem exactly, i.e., we find the wavefunctions and the spectrum. We then also propose a similar non-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of the isotonic oscillator which is exactly solved for a certain range of the parameters.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions offer profound insights into fundamental quantum phenomena and enhance our understanding of complex materials and systems. However, identifying quantum phase transitions in the absence of conventional order parameters poses a significant challenge. To address this, we utilize reduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS) vector field to construct phase diagrams of various quantum systems and then demonstrate its efficacy in reproducing the phase diagrams of established models with known order parameter. To this end, we propose a new method for discovering the necessary order parameters for a given quantum model and illustrate its capability by identifying a suitable order parameter for the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) Model. Our analysis, which includes decomposing the observable into its eigen-projectors alongside the finite-size scaling, confirms that our method successfully can determine order parameters and thus its capable of characterizing quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Generalised Circuit Partitioning for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a new paradigm aimed at scaling up quantum computing via the interconnection of smaller quantum processing units (QPUs). Shared entanglement allows teleportation of both states and gates between QPUs. This leads to an attractive horizontal scaling of quantum processing power, which comes at the expense of the additional time and noise introduced by entanglement sharing protocols. Consequently, methods for partitioning quantum circuits across multiple QPUs should aim to minimise the amount of entanglement-based communication required between distributed QPUs. Existing protocols tend to focus primarily on optimising entanglement costs for gate teleportation or state teleportation to cover operations between QPUs, rather than both at the same time. The most general form of the problem should treat gate and state teleportation on the same footing, allowing minimal cost circuit partitions through a combination of the two. This work introduces a graph-based formulation which allows joint optimisation of gate and state teleportation cost, including extensions of gate teleportation which group gates together for distribution using common resources. The formulation permits low e-bit cost for a variety of circuit types. Using a basic genetic algorithm, improved performance over state-of-the-art methods is obtained in terms of both average e-bit cost and time scaling.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an fanomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries -- called quantum cellular automata (QCA) -- we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purification maps a mixed state to a pure state and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Luttinger Liquids from sublattice dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how Exceptional Points (EPs) naturally occur in the Luttinger Liquid (LL) theory describing the low-energy excitations of a microscopic lattice model with sublattice dependent electron-electron interaction. Upon bosonization, this sublattice dependence directly translates to a non-standard sine-Gordon-type term responsible for the non-Hermitian matrix structure of the single-particle Green Function (GF). As the structure in the lifetime of excitations does not commute with the underlying free Bloch Hamiltonian, non-Hermitian topological properties of the single-particle GF emerge -- despite our Hermitian model Hamiltonian. Both finite temperature and a non-trivial Luttinger parameter $K\neq 1$ are required for the formation of EPs, and their topological stability in one spatial dimension is guaranteed by the chiral symmetry of our model. In the presence of the aforementioned sine-Gordon-term, we resort to leading order Perturbation Theory (PT) to compute the single-particle GF. All qualitative findings derived within LL theory are corroborated by comparison to both numerical simulations within the conserving second Born approximation, and, for weak interactions and high temperatures, by fermionic plain PT. In certain parameter regimes, quantitative agreement can be reached by a suitable parameter choice in the effective bosonized model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fundamental role that bosonic and fermionic symmetries play in physics, we study (non-invertible) one-form symmetries in $2 + 1$d consisting of topological lines with bosonic and fermionic self-statistics. We refer to these lines as Bose-Fermi-Braided (BFB) symmetries and argue that they can be classified. Unlike the case of generic anyonic lines, BFB symmetries are closely related to groups. In particular, when BFB lines are non-invertible, they are non-intrinsically non-invertible. Moreover, BFB symmetries are, in a categorical sense, weakly group theoretical. Using this understanding, we study invariants of renormalization group flows involving non-topological QFTs with BFB symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and advances in quantum computing (QC) drive the interdisciplinary field of quantum machine learning to new levels. However, due to the susceptibility of ML models to adversarial attacks, practical use raises safety-critical concerns. Existing Randomized Smoothing (RS) certification methods for classical machine learning models are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the combination of QC and the concept of discrete randomized smoothing to speed up the stochastic certification of ML models for discrete data. We show how to encode all the perturbations of the input binary data in superposition and use Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to obtain a quadratic reduction in the number of calls to the model that are required compared to traditional randomized smoothing techniques. In addition, we propose a new binary threat model to allow for an extensive evaluation of our approach on images, graphs, and text.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in monolayer semiconductors coupled to transition metal dichalcogenide nanoantennas on silica and gold substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single photon emitters (SPEs) offer numerous advantages to quantum information applications, such as high single photon purity and deterministic positioning. Strain in the host monolayer, induced by underlying dielectric Mie resonators, is known to localize their formation to positions co-located with near-field photonic hotspots providing further control over their optical properties. However, traditional materials used for the fabrication of nanoresonators, such as silicon or gallium phosphide (GaP), often require a high refractive index substrate resulting in losses of the emitted light and limited photonic enhancement. Here, we use nanoantennas (NAs) fabricated from multilayer TMDs, which allow complete flexibility with the choice of substrate due to the adhesive van der Waals forces, enabling high refractive index contrast or the use of highly reflective metallic surfaces. We demonstrate the localized formation of SPEs in WSe$_2$ monolayers transferred onto WS$_2$ NAs on both SiO$_2$ and Au substrates, enabling strong photonic enhancements and increased single photon collection. We provide evidence for enhanced quantum efficiencies (QE) reaching an average value of 43% (7%) for SPEs on WS$_2$ NAs on a SiO$_2$ (Au) substrate. We further combine the advantages offered by both dielectric and metallic substrates to numerically simulate an optimized NA geometry for maximum WSe$_2$ single photon excitation, emission, collection. Thus, the fluorescence is enhanced by a factor of over 4 orders of magnitude compared to vacuum and 5 orders of magnitude compared to a flat SiO$_2$/Si surface. Our work showcases the advantages offered by employing TMD material nanoresonators on various substrates for SPE formation and photonic enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the helical compactification of spatial dimension on the local properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter. A general background geometry is considered with rotational symmetry in the subspace with the coordinates appearing in the helical periodicity condition. It is shown that by a coordinate transformation the problem is reduced to the problem with standard quasiperiodicity condition in the same local geometry and with the effective compactification radius determined by the length of the compact dimension and the helicity parameter. As an application of the general procedure we have considered locally de Sitter spacetime with a helical compact dimension. By using the Hadamard function for the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared, current density, and energy-momentum tensor are studied. The topological contributions are explicitly separated and their asymptotics are described at early and late stages of cosmological expansion. An important difference, compared to the problem with quasiperiodic conditions, is the appearance of the nonzero off-diagonal component of the energy-momentum tensor and of the component of the current density along the uncompact dimension.</description>

      <title>Validation of an Analysability Model in Hybrid Quantum Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of quantum-classical hybrid computing, evaluating analysability, which is the ease of understanding and modifying software, presents significant challenges due to the complexity and novelty of quantum algorithms. Although advances have been made in quantum software development, standard software quality evaluation methods do not fully address the specifics of quantum components, resulting in a gap in the ability to ensure and maintain the quality of hybrid software products. In this registered report proposal, we intend to validate a quality model focused on the analysability of hybrid software through an international collab orative approach involving academic institutions from Italy and Spain through a controlled experiment. This approach allows for a more detailed analysis and validation methodology and establishes a framework for future research and developments in software quality assessment in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Molecular influence on nuclear-quadrupole-coupling effects in laser induced alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the effect of nuclear-quadrupole interactions on the field-free impulsive alignment of different asymmetric-top molecules. Our analysis is focused on the influence of the hyperfine- and rotational-energy-level structures. These depend on the number of nuclear spins, the rotational constants, and the symmetry of the tensors involved in the nuclear spin and external field interactions. Comparing the prototypical large-nuclear-spin molecules iodobenzene, 1,2-diiodobenzene, 1,3-diiodobenzene, and 2,5-diiodobenzonitrile, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the hyperfine splittings compared to the rotational-energy splittings plays a crucial role in the spin-rotational dynamics after the laser pulse. Moreover, we point out that the impact of the quadrupole coupling on the rotational dynamics decreases when highly excited rotational states dominate the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties such as entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Addressing of Versatile Nanodiamonds via Physically-Enabled Classifier in Complex Bio-Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers show great potentials for nanoscale bio-sensing and bio-imaging. Nevertheless, their envisioned bio-applications suffer from intrinsic background noise due to unavoidable light scattering and autofluorescence in cells and tissues. Herein, we develop a novel all-optical modulated imaging method via physically-enabled classifier, for on-demand and direct access to NV fluorescence at pixel resolution while effectively filtering out background noise. Specifically, NV fluorescence can be modulated optically to exhibit sinusoid-like variations, providing basis for classification. We validate our method in various complex biological scenarios with fluorescence interference, ranging from cells to organisms. Notably, our classification-based approach achieves almost 10^6 times enhancement of signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) in neural protein imaging. We also demonstrate 4-fold contrast improvement in optically-detected magnetic resonance measurements (ODMR) of FNDs inside stained cells. Our technique offers a generic, explainable and robust solution, applicable for realistic high-fidelity imaging and sensing in challenging noise-laden scenarios.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement routing in near-term quantum networks consists of choosing the optimal sequence of short-range entanglements to combine through swapping operations to establish end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. Similar to traditional routing technologies, a quantum routing protocol uses network information to choose the best paths to satisfy a set of end-to-end entanglement requests. However, in addition to network state information, a quantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement fidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short lifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical entanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to address it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network routing strategies where applicable. We classify and discuss the studied quantum routing schemes into reactive, proactive, opportunistic, and virtual routing</description>

      <title>Exchange control in a MOS double quantum dot made using a 300 mm wafer process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the advanced manufacturing capabilities of the semiconductor industry promises to help scale up silicon-based quantum processors by increasing yield, uniformity and integration. Recent studies of quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes have shown control and readout of individual spin qubits, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm wafer MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, forming the basis of an entangling gate such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of 10. We further extend the coherence by up to an order of magnitude using an echo sequence. For readout, we introduce a dispersive readout technique, the radiofrequency electron cascade, that amplifies the signal while retaining the spin-projective nature of dispersive measurements. Our results demonstrate an industrial grade platform for two-qubit operations, alongside integration with dispersive sensing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation in insulators and the key role of hole scattering processes: Band insulators, charge density waves and Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mobile impurity immersed in a non-interacting Fermi sea is dressed by the gapless particle-hole excitations of the fermionic medium. This conventional Fermi-polaron setting is well described by the so-called ladder approximation, which consists in neglecting impurity-hole scattering processes. In this work, we analyze polaron formation in the context of insulating states of matter, considering increasing levels of correlation in the medium:~band insulators originating from external periodic potentials, spontaneously-formed charge density waves, and a Fermi-Hubbard system undergoing a metal-Mott insulator transition. The polaron spectral function is shown to exhibit striking signatures of the underlying fermionic background, such as the single-particle band gap, particle-hole symmetry and the transition to the Mott state. These signatures are identified within the framework of the Chevy ansatz, i.e. upon restricting the Hilbert space to single particle-hole excitations. Interestingly, we find that the ladder approximation is inaccurate in these band systems, due to the fact that the particle and hole scattering phase spaces are comparable. Our results provide a step forward in the understanding of polaron formation in correlated many-body media, which are relevant to both cold-atom and semiconductor experiments.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of Rydberg atoms resonantly exchanging energy via two-, three-, and four-body dipole-dipole interactions in a one-dimensional array. Using simplified models of a realistic experimental system, we study the initial state survival probability, mean level spacing, spread of entanglement, and properties of the energy eigenstates. By exploring a range of disorders and interaction strengths, we find regions in parameter space where the three- and four-body dynamics either fail to thermalize or do so slowly. The interplay between the stronger hopping and weaker field-tuned interactions gives rise to quantum many-body scar states, which play a critical role in slowing the dynamics of the three- and four-body interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking accurate measurements of the temperature of quantum systems is a challenging task. The mathematical peculiarities of quantum information make it virtually impossible to measure with infinite precision. In the present paper, we introduce a generalize thermal state, which is conditioned on the pointer states of the available measurement apparatus. We show that this conditional thermal state outperforms the Gibbs state in quantum thermometry. The origin for the enhanced precision can be sought in its asymmetry quantified by the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. This additional resource is further clarified in a fully resource-theoretic analysis, and we show that there is a Gibbs-preserving map to convert a target state into the conditional thermal state. We relate the quantum J-divergence between the conditional thermal state and the same target state to quantum heat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical phenomena of quantum systems are useful for enhancement of quantum sensing. However, experimental realizations of criticality enhancement have been confined to very few systems, owing to the stringent requirements, including the thermodynamical or scaling limit, and fine control of interacting quantum susystems or particles. We here propose a simple critical quantum sensing scheme that requires neither of these conditions. The critical system is realized with a single parametrically-driven bosonic mode involving many non-interacting bosons. We calculate the quantum Fisher information, and perform a simulation, which confirms the criticality-enabled enhancement. We further detail the response of one of the quadratures to the variation of the control parameter. The numerical results reveal that its inverted variance exhibits a diverging behavior at the critical point. Based on the presently available control techniques of parametric driving, we expect our scheme can be realized in different systems, e.g., ion traps and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedups for quantum walks in random hierarchical graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into "supervertices" which are arranged according to a $d$-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices.
  The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.</description>

      <title>Flux-pulse-assisted Readout of a Fluxonium Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much attention has focused on the transmon architecture for large-scale superconducting quantum devices, however, the fluxonium qubit has emerged as a possible successor. With a shunting inductor in parallel to a Josephson junction, the fluxonium offers larger anharmonicity and stronger protection against dielectric loss, leading to higher coherence times as compared to conventional transmon qubits. The interplay between the inductive and Josephson energy potentials of the fluxonium qubit leads to a rich dispersive shift landscape when tuning the external flux. Here we propose to exploit the features in the dispersive shift to improve qubit readout. Specifically, we report on theoretical simulations showing improved readout times and error rates by performing the readout at a flux bias point with large dispersive shift. We expand the scheme to include different error channels, and show that with an integration time of 155 ns, flux-pulse-assisted readout offers about 5 times improvement in the signal to noise ratio. Moreover, we show that the performance improvement persists in the presence of finite measurement efficiency combined with quasi-static flux noise, and also when considering the increased Purcell rate at the flux-pulse-assisted readout point. We suggest a set of reasonable energy parameters for the fluxonium architecture that will allow for the implementation of our proposed flux-pulse-assisted readout scheme.</description>

Abstract: We present and investigate two issues within the measurement scheme for QFT presented by J. Polo-G\'omez, L. J. Garay and E. Mart\'in-Mart\'inez in "A detector-based measurement theory for quantum field theory". We point out some discrepancies that arise when the measurement scheme is applied to contextual field states and show that $n$-point function assignments based on local processing regions sometimes lead to inconsistencies. To solve these issues, we modify the measurement scheme to use non-relativistic detectors to induce an update rule for algebraic states in the Haag-Kastler formulation of quantum field theory. In this way, $n$-point functions can be consistently evaluated across any region having a definite causal relation with measurements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising method in quantum machine learning thanks to the guarantees connected to them. Their accessibility for analytic considerations also opens up the possibility of prescreening datasets based on their potential for a quantum advantage. To do so, earlier works developed the geometric difference, which can be understood as a closeness measure between two kernel-based machine learning approaches, most importantly between a quantum kernel and a classical kernel. This metric links the quantum and classical model complexities, and it was developed to bound generalization error. Therefore, it raises the question of how this metric behaves in an empirical setting. In this work, we investigate the effects of hyperparameter choice on the model performance and the generalization gap between classical and quantum kernels. The importance of hyperparameters is well known also for classical machine learning. Of special interest are hyperparameters associated with the quantum Hamiltonian evolution feature map, as well as the number of qubits to trace out before computing a projected quantum kernel. We conduct a thorough investigation of the hyperparameters across 11 datasets and we identify certain aspects that can be exploited. Analyzing the effects of certain hyperparameter settings on the empirical performance, as measured by cross validation accuracy, and generalization ability, as measured by geometric difference described above, brings us one step closer to understanding the potential of quantum kernel methods on classical datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of semidefinite programming to the realm of quantum codes, specifically focusing on codeword stabilized (CWS) codes with entanglement assistance. Notably, we utilize the isotropic subgroup of the CWS group and the set of word operators of a CWS-type quantum code to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance. Furthermore, this characterization can be incorporated into the associated distance enumerators, enabling us to construct semidefinite constraints that lead to SDP bounds on the minimum distance or size of CWS-type quantum codes. We illustrate several instances where SDP bounds outperform LP bounds, and there are even cases where LP fails to yield meaningful results, while SDP consistently provides tighter and relevant bounds. Finally, we also provide interpretations of the Shor-Laflamme weight enumerators and shadow enumerators for codeword stabilized codes, enhancing our understanding of quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coding with Finite Thermodynamic Resources</title>

Abstract: Quantum direct coding or Schumacher compression generalised the ideas of Shannon theory, gave an operational meaning to the von Neumann entropy and established the term qubit. But remembering that information processing is carried out by physical processes prompts one to wonder what thermodynamic resources are required to compress quantum information and how they constrain one's ability to perform this task. That is, if Alice and Bob only have access to thermal quantum states and clocks with finite accuracy, how well can they measure, encode and decode pure quantum state messages? In this work we examine these questions by modelling Alice's typical measurement as a unitary involving a measurement probe, investigating imperfect timekeeping on encoding and decoding and considering the role of temperature in Bob's appended qubits. In doing so, we derive fidelity bounds for this protocol involving the correlations Alice can form with their measurement probe, the variance of the clock's ticks and the temperature of Bob's qubits. Finally, we give an insight into the entropy produced by these two agents throughout the compression protocol by relating the resources they use to a quantum thermodynamic cooling protocol.</description>

      <title>Making the zeroth-order process fidelity independent of state preparation and measurement errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the zero-fidelity, an approximation to the process fidelity, when combined with randomized benchmarking, becomes robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. However, as randomized benchmarking requires randomly choosing an increasingly large number of Clifford elements from the Clifford group when the qubit number increases, this combination is also limited to quantum systems with up to three qubits. To make the zero-fidelity independent of SPAM errors and, at the same time, applicable to multi-qubit systems, we employ a channel noise scaling method similar to the method of global unitary folding, or identity scaling, used for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the generation of entangled two-photon pairs by Cooper pair recombination in a noncentrosymmetric [001]-quantum well superconductor, driven by a forward-biased p-n junction with a superconducting layer which exhibits admixture Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that the highest achievable purity of entangled photon pairs emerges within scenarios involving pure singlet Cooper pairs, specifically, the conventional $s$-wave gap function. Our results highlight the importance of minimizing the charge-carrier level concentration and balancing the magnitudes of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings to achieve entangled states with enhanced purity, which can be realized by reducing the amplitudes of antisymmetric spin-orbit couplings. In addition to purity concerns, to explore the distribution of two-photon states, we compare their population across entangled pairs for potential superconducting pairings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SupeSuperconducting resonators play a crucial role in developing forthcoming quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a niobium circuit with a 10 nm gold capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies. Among others, the presence of gold allows anchoring alkyl thiol groups to form self-assembled monolayers, improving the integration with molecular spin qubits for the development of hybrid quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in gravity beyond the Newton potential from a delocalised quantum source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in table-top experiments offers the opportunity to show for the first time that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained with the Newton potential, namely in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments.
  Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: they cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential and are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g. in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory or gravity. Hence, observing the form of this interaction would require either a modification to classical gravity or its quantum description. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing this term in the phase would be a test of the gravitational field as a quantum mediator.
  Identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of the gravitational field and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what proposed so far.</description>

Abstract: Linear systems of equations can be found in various mathematical domains, as well as in the field of machine learning. By employing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, variational solvers promise to accelerate finding solutions for large systems. Although there is a wealth of theoretical research on these algorithms, only fragmentary implementations exist. To fill this gap, we have developed the variational-lse-solver framework, which realizes existing approaches in literature, and introduces several enhancements. The user-friendly interface is designed for researchers that work at the abstraction level of identifying and developing end-to-end applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subtracting accidental coincidences is a common practice quantum optics experiments. For zero mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed vacuum, we show that if one removes accidental coincidences the measurement results are quantitatively the same, both for photon coincidences at very low flux and for intensity covariances. Consequently, pure quantum effects at the photon level, like interference of photon wave functions or photon bunching, are reproduced in the correlation of fluctuations of macroscopic beams issued from spontaneous down conversion. This is true both in experiment if the detection resolution is smaller than the coherence cell (size of the mode), and in stochastic simulations based on sampling the Wigner function. We discuss the limitations of this correspondence, such as Bell inequalities (for which one cannot substract accidental coincidences), highly multimode situations such as quantum imaging, and higher order correlations.</description>

Abstract: We present a global optimization routine for the variational quantum algorithms, which utilizes the dynamic tunneling flow. Originally designed to leverage information gathered by a gradient-based optimizer around local minima, we adapt the conventional dynamic tunneling flow to exploit the distance measure of quantum states, resolving issues of extrinsic degeneracy arising from the parametrization of quantum states. Our global optimization algorithm is applied to the variational quantum eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model to demonstrate the performance of our routine while comparing it with the conventional dynamic tunneling method, which is based on the Euclidean distance measure on the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Learning the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatz using transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exponentially faster computation for certain problems, quantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent years. Variational quantum algorithms are crucial methods to implement quantum computing, and an appropriate task-specific quantum circuit ansatz can effectively enhance the quantum advantage of VQAs. However, the vast search space makes it challenging to find the optimal task-specific ansatz. Expressibility, quantifying the diversity of quantum circuit ansatz states to explore the Hilbert space effectively, can be used to evaluate whether one ansatz is superior to another. In this work, we propose using a transformer model to predict the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze. We construct a dataset containing random PQCs generated by the gatewise pipeline, with varying numbers of qubits and gates. The expressibility of the circuits is calculated using three measures: KL divergence, relative KL divergence, and maximum mean discrepancy. A transformer model is trained on the dataset to capture the intricate relationships between circuit characteristics and expressibility. Four evaluation metrics are employed to assess the performance of the transformer. Numerical results demonstrate that the trained model achieves high performance and robustness across various expressibility measures. This research can enhance the understanding of the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze and advance quantum architecture search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bottlenecks of NISQ-friendly HHL algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises enabling solving large problem instances, e.g. large linear equation systems with HHL algorithm, once the hardware stack matures. For the foreseeable future quantum computing will remain in the so-called NISQ era, in which the algorithms need to account for the flaws of the hardware such as noise. In this work, we perform an empirical study to test scaling properties and directly related noise resilience of the the most resources-intense component of the HHL algorithm, namely QPE and its NISQ-adaptation Iterative QPE. We explore the effectiveness of noise mitigation techniques for these algorithms and investigate whether we can keep the gate number low by enforcing sparsity constraints on the input or using circuit optimization techniques provided by Qiskit package. Our results indicate that currently available noise mitigation techniques, such as Qiskit readout and Mthree readout packages, are insufficient for enabling results recovery even in the small instances tested here. Moreover, our results indicate that the scaling of these algorithms with increase in precision seems to be the most substantial obstacle. These insights allowed us to deduce an approximate bottleneck for algorithms that consider a similar time evolution as QPE. Such observations provide evidence of weaknesses of such algorithms on NISQ devices and help us formulate meaningful future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrafast quantum dynamics of photophysical processes in complex molecules is an extremely challenging computational problem with a wide variety of fascinating applications in quantum chemistry and biology. Inspired by recent developments in open quantum systems, we introduce a pure-state unraveled hybrid-bath method that describes a continuous environment via a set of discrete, effective bosonic degrees of freedom using a Markovian embedding. Our method is capable of describing both, a continuous spectral density and sharp peaks embedded into it. Thereby, we overcome the limitations of previous methods, which either capture long-time memory effects using the unitary dynamics of a set of discrete vibrational modes or use memoryless Markovian environments employing a Lindblad or Redfield master equation. We benchmark our method against two paradigmatic problems from quantum chemistry and biology. We demonstrate that compared to unitary descriptions, a significantly smaller number of bosonic modes suffices to describe the excitonic dynamics accurately, yielding a computational speed-up of nearly an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we take into account explicitly the effect of a $\delta$-peak in the spectral density of a light-harvesting complex, demonstrating the strong impact of the long-time memory of the environment on the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently infer system parameters is essential in any signal-processing task that requires fast operation. Dealing with quantum systems, a serious challenge arises due to substantial growth of the underlying Hilbert space with the system size. As the statistics of the measurement data observed, i.e. the likelihood, can no longer be easily computed, common approaches such as maximum-likelihood estimators or particle filters become impractical. To address this issue, we propose the use of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm, which evades likelihood computation by sampling from a library of measurement data -- a priori prepared for a given quantum device. We apply ABC to interpret photodetection click-patterns arising when probing in real time a two-level atom and an optomechanical system. For the latter, we consider both linear and non-linear regimes, in order to show how to tailor the ABC algorithm by understanding the quantum measurement statistics. Our work demonstrates that fast parameter inference may be possible no matter the complexity of a quantum device and the measurement scheme involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation based on Majorana objects is subject to a significant challenge because at least some of the two-qubit quantum gates rely on the fermion (either charge or spin) parity of the qubits. This dependency renders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when attempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such an approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield the undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we devise topological operations that allow for the non-dissipative correction of information from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the sparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example to explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum information carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be applied {to} either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent quantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and Majorana-edge-mode-based topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in measurement-only circuits</title>

Abstract: Magic, also known as nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state to the set of stabilizer states, and it serves as a necessary resource for potential quantum advantage over classical computing. In this work, we study magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of Clifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the non-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that can be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any magic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states. Leveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit in both one- and two-dimensional lattices using large-scale numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two different phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in which the mutual magic exhibits scaling behavior analogous to entanglement. We further show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the topological magic. In a different regime, with a vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds light on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits, employing genuine magic measures.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e. that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients are multiplicities of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group in restrictions and products of irreps. They play an important role in representation theory and are notoriously hard to compute. We give quantum algorithms that efficiently compute these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial. Using that the Kostka numbers admit combinatorial interpretation, we show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for polynomially-bounded Kostka numbers and conjecture existence of a similar algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why the same classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients, give evidence on how our quantum algorithm may avoid some hardness obstructions in their computation, and conjecture that the problem could lead to superpolynomial quantum speedups on some inputs. We finally use Frobenius reciprocity to derive another quantum algorithm that estimates these coefficients using induction and has a different cost-to-input dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Driving of an open quantum system at finite temperature across first- and second-order quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open fully connected system of qubits at nonzero temperature is driven within a finite time interval along various paths in the space of its control parameters. The driving leads across finite-size precursors of the first- and second-order quantum phase transition from factorized to entangled ground-state phases, aiming at the preparation of the complex ground state of the system at the final parameter point with maximal fidelity. During the drive, the system is coupled to a heat bath with a constant temperature, the dynamics being determined in a nonpertubative way by the method of Hierarchical Equations of Motion. It is shown that the presence of the heat bath in combination with specific patterns of avoided crossings affecting the ground and excited states in the parameter region around the quantum phase transition may considerably improve the fidelity of preparation of the target ground state.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields, and find a picture of a black hole. For spherical static highly-excited configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution for Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to the speculative view that the configuration represents semi-classically a quantum-gravitational condensate with holographic bulk dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Understanding molecular state evolution is central to many disciplines, including molecular dynamics, precision measurement, and molecule-based quantum technology. Details of the evolution are obscured when observing a statistical ensemble of molecules. Here, we reported real-time observations of thermal radiation-driven transitions between individual states ("jumps") of a single molecule. We reversed these "jumps" through microwave-driven transitions, resulting in a twentyfold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in-situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields. Our approaches for state detection and manipulation could apply to a wide range of species, facilitating their uses in fields including quantum science, molecular physics, and ion-neutral chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects, where results are estimated with typical experimental parameters. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems, the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce QDsim, a python package tailored for the rapid generation of charge stability diagrams in large-scale quantum dot devices, extending beyond traditional double or triple dots. QDsim is founded on the constant interaction model from which we rephrase the task of finding the lowest energy charge configuration as a convex optimization problem. Therefore, we can leverage the existing package CVXPY, in combination with an appropriate powerful solver, for the convex optimization which streamlines the creation of stability diagrams and polytopes. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate how QDsim enables the generation of large-scale dataset that can serve a basis for the training of machine-learning models for automated tuning algorithms. While the package currently does not support quantum effects beyond the constant interaction model, QDsim is a tool that directly addresses the critical need for cost-effective and expeditious data acquisition for better tuning algorithms in order to accelerate the development of semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the atomic superfluid phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>
