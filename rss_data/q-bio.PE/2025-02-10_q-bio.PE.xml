      <title>R3F: An R package for evolutionary dates, rates, and priors using the relative rate framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative rate framework (RRF) can estimate divergence times from branch lengths in a phylogeny, which is the theoretical basis of the RelTime method frequently applied, a relaxed clock approach for molecular dating that scales well for large phylogenies. The use of RRF has also enabled the development of computationally efficient and accurate methods for testing the autocorrelation of lineage rates in a phylogeny (CorrTest) and selecting data-driven parameters of the birth-death speciation model (ddBD), which can be used to specify priors in Bayesian molecular dating. We have developed R3F, an R package implementing RRF to estimate divergence times, infer lineage rates, conduct CorrTest, and build a ddBD tree prior for Bayesian dating in molecular phylogenies. Here, we describe R3F functionality and explain how to interpret and use its outputs in other visualization software and packages, such as MEGA, ggtree, and FigTree. Ultimately, R3F is intended to enable the dating of the Tree of Life with greater accuracy and precision, which would have important implications for studies of organism evolution, diversification dynamics, phylogeography, and biogeography. Availability and Implementation: The source codes and related instructions for installing and implementing R3F are available from GitHub (https://github.com/cathyqqtao/R3F).</description>

      <title>PhyloVAE: Unsupervised Learning of Phylogenetic Trees via Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning informative representations of phylogenetic tree structures is essential for analyzing evolutionary relationships. Classical distance-based methods have been widely used to project phylogenetic trees into Euclidean space, but they are often sensitive to the choice of distance metric and may lack sufficient resolution. In this paper, we introduce phylogenetic variational autoencoders (PhyloVAEs), an unsupervised learning framework designed for representation learning and generative modeling of tree topologies. Leveraging an efficient encoding mechanism inspired by autoregressive tree topology generation, we develop a deep latent-variable generative model that facilitates fast, parallelized topology generation. PhyloVAE combines this generative model with a collaborative inference model based on learnable topological features, allowing for high-resolution representations of phylogenetic tree samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate PhyloVAE's robust representation learning capabilities and fast generation of phylogenetic tree topologies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic neutral fractions and the effective population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a general structured population is modelled using a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an infinite divisibility property. This property allows the population to be divided into an arbitrary number of allelic components, also known as stochastic neutral fractions. When demographic noise is small, a fast-slow principle provides a general formula for the effective population size in structured populations. To illustrate this approach, we revisit several examples from the literature, including age-structured models and expansion fronts.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence and evolution of information handling is essential for unraveling the origins of life. Traditional genetic-first and metabolism-first models fall short in explaining how instructional information control systems naturally arise from molecular dynamics. To address this gap, we adopt an information-first approach, integrating Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- an extension of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality. These models, which embody closure to efficient causation while remaining open to formal causation, provide a robust framework for primitive autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We establish a formal equivalence between extended (F, A)-systems and communicating X-machines, resolving self-referential challenges and demonstrating the hypercomputational nature of life processes. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of information handling from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities. This transition from analog to digital architectures enhances evolutionary robustness and aligns with experimental evidence suggesting that chemical computation does not require life-specific chemistry. Furthermore, we incorporate open-ended evolutionary dynamics driven by computational undecidability and irreducibility, reinforcing the necessity of unconventional computing frameworks. This computational enactivist perspective provides a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation and adaptation in order to solve the problem of relevance. By highlighting the critical role of hypercomputational processes in life's emergence and evolution, our framework offers new insights into the fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</description>
