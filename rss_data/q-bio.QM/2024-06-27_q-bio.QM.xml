      <title>Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. Fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis are crucial components of digital aquaculture, which are essential for optimizing production efficiency, enhancing fish welfare, and improving resource management. Previous reviews have focused on single modalities, limiting their ability to address the diverse challenges encountered in these tasks comprehensively. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of aquaculture digital technologies, including vision-based, acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods. We examine the advantages, limitations, and applications of these methods, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical research gaps. The scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards, which make it difficult to compare the performance of different technologies, are identified as major obstacles hindering progress in this field. To overcome current limitations and improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of fish monitoring systems, we explore the potential of emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning. Additionally, we contribute to the field by providing a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and promote their practical implementation in real-world aquaculture settings.</description>

      <title>Concordance in basal cell carcinoma diagnosis. Building a proper ground truth to train Artificial Intelligence tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The existence of different basal cell carcinoma (BCC) clinical criteria cannot be objectively validated. An adequate ground-truth is needed to train an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that explains the BCC diagnosis by providing its dermoscopic features. Objectives: To determine the consensus among dermatologists on dermoscopic criteria of 204 BCC. To analyze the performance of an AI tool when the ground-truth is inferred. Methods: A single center, diagnostic and prospective study was conducted to analyze the agreement in dermoscopic criteria by four dermatologists and then derive a reference standard. 1434 dermoscopic images have been used, that were taken by a primary health physician, sent via teledermatology, and diagnosed by a dermatologist. They were randomly selected from the teledermatology platform (2019-2021). 204 of them were tested with an AI tool; the remainder trained it. The performance of the AI tool trained using the ground-truth of one dermatologist versus the ground-truth statistically inferred from the consensus of four dermatologists was analyzed using McNemar's test and Hamming distance. Results: Dermatologists achieve perfect agreement in the diagnosis of BCC (Fleiss-Kappa=0.9079), and a high correlation with the biopsy (PPV=0.9670). However, there is low agreement in detecting some dermoscopic criteria. Statistical differences were found in the performance of the AI tool trained using the ground-truth of one dermatologist versus the ground-truth statistically inferred from the consensus of four dermatologists. Conclusions: Care should be taken when training an AI tool to determine the BCC patterns present in a lesion. Ground-truth should be established from multiple dermatologists.</description>

      <title>Building multiscale models with PhysiBoSS, an agent-based modeling tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale models provide a unique tool for studying complex processes that study events occurring at different scales across space and time. In the context of biological systems, such models can simulate mechanisms happening at the intracellular level such as signaling, and at the extracellular level where cells communicate and coordinate with other cells. They aim to understand the impact of genetic or environmental deregulation observed in complex diseases, describe the interplay between a pathological tissue and the immune system, and suggest strategies to revert the diseased phenotypes. The construction of these multiscale models remains a very complex task, including the choice of the components to consider, the level of details of the processes to simulate, or the fitting of the parameters to the data. One additional difficulty is the expert knowledge needed to program these models in languages such as C++ or Python, which may discourage the participation of non-experts. Simplifying this process through structured description formalisms -- coupled with a graphical interface -- is crucial in making modeling more accessible to the broader scientific community, as well as streamlining the process for advanced users. This article introduces three examples of multiscale models which rely on the framework PhysiBoSS, an add-on of PhysiCell that includes intracellular descriptions as continuous time Boolean models to the agent-based approach. The article demonstrates how to easily construct such models, relying on PhysiCell Studio, the PhysiCell Graphical User Interface. A step-by-step tutorial is provided as a Supplementary Material and all models are provided at: https://physiboss.github.io/tutorial/.</description>

      <title>Parameter selection and optimization of a computational network model of blood flow in single-ventricle patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart disease responsible for 23% of infant cardiac deaths each year. HLHS patients are born with an underdeveloped left heart, requiring several surgeries to reconstruct the aorta and create a single ventricle circuit known as the Fontan circulation. While survival into early adulthood is becoming more common, Fontan patients suffer from reduced cardiac output, putting them at risk for a multitude of complications. These patients are monitored using chest and neck MRI imaging, but these scans do not capture energy loss, pressure, wave intensity, or hemodynamics beyond the imaged region. This study develops a framework for predicting these missing features by combining imaging data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Predicted features from models of HLHS patients are compared to those from control patients with a double outlet right ventricle (DORV). We use parameter inference to render the model patient-specific. In the calibrated model, we predict pressure, flow, wave-intensity (WI), and wall shear stress (WSS). Results reveal that HLHS patients have higher vascular stiffness and lower compliance than DORV patients, resulting in lower WSS and higher WI in the ascending aorta and increased WSS and decreased WI in the descending aorta.</description>

      <title>Hot-Distance: Combining One-Hot and Signed Distance Embeddings for Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are only as good as the data to which they are fit. As such, it is always preferable to use as much data as possible in training models. What data can be used for fitting a model depends a lot on the formulation of the task. We introduce Hot-Distance, a novel segmentation target that incorporates the strength of signed boundary distance prediction with the flexibility of one-hot encoding, to increase the amount of usable training data for segmentation of subcellular structures in focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM).</description>

      <title>Automated Immunophenotyping Assessment for Diagnosing Childhood Acute Leukemia using Set-Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acute Leukemia is the most common hematologic malignancy in children and adolescents. A key methodology in the diagnostic evaluation of this malignancy is immunophenotyping based on Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (FCM). However, this approach is manual, and thus time-consuming and subjective. To alleviate this situation, we propose in this paper the FCM-Former, a machine learning, self-attention based FCM-diagnostic tool, automating the immunophenotyping assessment in Childhood Acute Leukemia. The FCM-Former is trained in a supervised manner, by directly using flow cytometric data. Our FCM-Former achieves an accuracy of 96.5% assigning lineage to each sample among 960 cases of either acute B-cell, T-cell lymphoblastic, and acute myeloid leukemia (B-ALL, T-ALL, AML). To the best of our knowledge, the FCM-Former is the first work that automates the immunophenotyping assessment with FCM data in diagnosing pediatric Acute Leukemia.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based de novo peptide sequencing for data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) stands as the predominant high-throughput technique for comprehensively analyzing protein content within biological samples. This methodology is a cornerstone driving the advancement of proteomics. In recent years, substantial strides have been made in Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) strategies, facilitating impartial and non-targeted fragmentation of precursor ions. The DIA-generated MS/MS spectra present a formidable obstacle due to their inherent high multiplexing nature. Each spectrum encapsulates fragmented product ions originating from multiple precursor peptides. This intricacy poses a particularly acute challenge in de novo peptide/protein sequencing, where current methods are ill-equipped to address the multiplexing conundrum. In this paper, we introduce DiaTrans, a deep-learning model based on transformer architecture. It deciphers peptide sequences from DIA mass spectrometry data. Our results show significant improvements over existing STOA methods, including DeepNovo-DIA and PepNet. Casanovo-DIA enhances precision by 15.14% to 34.8%, recall by 11.62% to 31.94% at the amino acid level, and boosts precision by 59% to 81.36% at the peptide level. Integrating DIA data and our DiaTrans model holds considerable promise to uncover novel peptides and more comprehensive profiling of biological samples.

      <title>VADA: a Data-Driven Simulator for Nanopore Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing offers the ability for real-time analysis of long DNA sequences at a low cost, enabling new applications such as early detection of cancer. Due to the complex nature of nanopore measurements and the high cost of obtaining ground truth datasets, there is a need for nanopore simulators. Existing simulators rely on handcrafted rules and parameters and do not learn an internal representation that would allow for analysing underlying biological factors of interest. Instead, we propose VADA, a purely data-driven method for simulating nanopores based on an autoregressive latent variable model. We embed subsequences of DNA and introduce a conditional prior to address the challenge of a collapsing conditioning. We introduce an auxiliary regressor on the latent variable to encourage our model to learn an informative latent representation. We empirically demonstrate that our model achieves competitive simulation performance on experimental nanopore data. Moreover, we show we have learned an informative latent representation that is predictive of the DNA labels. We hypothesize that other biological factors of interest, beyond the DNA labels, can potentially be extracted from such a learned latent representation.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can either adjust the model, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.</description>

      <title>Sequential Model for Predicting Patient Adherence in Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for Allergic Rhinitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) is the long-lasting causal treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). How to enhance the adherence of patients to maximize the benefit of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) plays a crucial role in the management of AIT. This study aims to leverage novel machine learning models to precisely predict the risk of non-adherence of AR patients and related local symptom scores in three years SCIT.
  Methods: The research develops and analyzes two models, sequential latent-variable model (SLVM) of Sequential Latent Actor-Critic (SLAC) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) evaluating them based on scoring and adherence prediction capabilities.
  Results: Excluding the biased samples at the first time step, the predictive adherence accuracy of the SLAC models is from 60\% to 72\%, and for LSTM models, it is 66\% to 84\%, varying according to the time steps. The range of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SLAC models is between 0.93 and 2.22, while for LSTM models it is between 1.09 and 1.77. Notably, these RMSEs are significantly lower than the random prediction error of 4.55.
  Conclusion: We creatively apply sequential models in the long-term management of SCIT with promising accuracy in the prediction of SCIT nonadherence in AR patients. While LSTM outperforms SLAC in adherence prediction, SLAC excels in score prediction for patients undergoing SCIT for AR. The state-action-based SLAC adds flexibility, presenting a novel and effective approach for managing long-term AIT.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>
