      <title>Conserved charges and asymptotic symmetries of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the solution phase space method, we investigate the conserved charges of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity. Our study shows that the black hole mass, angular momentum and entropy are influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter. Through the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we derive the asymptotic charge algebra, which consists of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with non-trivial central charges. By employing the Cardy formula, we calculate the microscopic entropy of dual conformal field theory, which precisely matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, by imposing the Detournay-Smoes-Wutte boundary conditions in the near horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ-like black hole, we obtain a Virasoro-Kac-Moody $\mathrm{U(1)}$ algebra, representing the symmetry algebra of a warped conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal boundaries near extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial constitutive laws and unified structures in constrained BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does a nontrivial gravitational excitation require a modified internal gauge theory constitutive law? As there is no canonical mapping between differential forms valued in distinct Lie algebras, the answer is negative, and entirely dependent on the specific unification scheme. A structural formulation in BF theory in terms of a constitutive diagram between the excitations of different interaction sectors is provided, alongside a discussion of the structure of the broken phase. As a nontrivial option, a spontaneous breaking into the physical constraint is attempted, however it is shown that basic B-potentials alone would not be viable. A heuristic discussion of internal and external gauge theory is provided, and by conflating the observer's internal and external state with the spacetime tangent structure, it is argued that there is a simple geometric obstruction to a nontrivially unified phase. A more ad hoc treatment of gauge theory and gravitational structure remains as the clear path forward, while observer, signal and causal considerations would suggest studying alternative backgrounds to the manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Fortuity in Vector Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space of $U(N)$ gauge-invariant operators in coupled matrix-vector systems at finite $N$, extending previous work on single matrix models. By using the Molien-Weyl formula, we compute the partition function and identify the structure of primary and secondary invariants. In specific examples we verify, using the trace relations, that these invariants do indeed generate the complete space of gauge invariant operators. For vector models with $f \leq N$ species of vectors, the space is freely generated by primary invariants, while for $f &gt; N$, secondary invariants appear, reflecting the presence of nontrivial trace relations. We derive analytic expressions for the number of secondary invariants and explore their growth. These results suggest a bosonic analogue of the fortuity mechanism. Our findings have implications for higher-spin holography and gauge-gravity duality, with applications to both vector and matrix models.</description>

      <title>Hiden Zeros and $2$-split via BCFW Recursion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide another angle to understand recent discoveries, i.e., the hidden zeros and corresponding 2-split behavior using the BCFW recursion relation. For the hidden zeros, we show that although the BCFW recursion relation is not directly applicable for computing amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model, we can indeed prove the zeros using the modified BCFW recursion relation. Our work also indicates that for the 2-split to hold, the current should be carefully defined.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Black Hole Entropy for Black Holes in Subtracted Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carefully examine the exact analytic spectrum of quasinormal modes of general black holes in the so-called subtracted geometry of maximally supersymmetric supergravity. These black holes have the same area and surface gravity at both the outer and inner horizons as the original asymptotically flat black holes. We proceed to explore the relationship with conformal field theories that describe horizon physics of these black holes. As a consequence, we show that the horizon area of these black holes is quantized in units of 8{\pi}l_{Planck}^2.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement in AdS$_{3}$ Vaidya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. Our results seem to be consistent with how the quenched CFT evolve towards thermalization.</description>

      <title>Average Spread Complexity and the Higher-Order Level Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills interaction from boundary vector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a non-abelian spin 1 gauge theory with a cubic interaction in AdS$_4$ from the Exact Renormalisation Group (ERG) flow of a CFT in 3 dimensions. The latter is the ${USp}(2N)$ singlet sector of the free field theory of $2N$ massless complex scalars. The quadratic and cubic terms in the bulk action are those of a gauge fixed version of a (local) gauge invariant action. By construction this bulk action is the evolution operator for the ERG equation of the boundary theory and thus is guaranteed to reproduce the correct boundary correlators using the usual AdS/CFT prescription. This work expands on the programme first set out in arXiv:1706.03371.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence Against a Semiclassical Baby Universe in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a large class of asymptotically AdS geometries with a semiclassical baby universe cannot be realized within the AdS/CFT correspondence. This in particular resolves a recent puzzle introduced by Antonini and Rath, in which a single CFT state appeared to simultaneously describe an AdS spacetime with a baby universe and one without. We construct a low-energy (and low complexity) boundary operator whose expectation values in the descriptions with and without the baby universe cannot match if the baby universe is semiclassical. This operator conclusively identifies the actual bulk dual: the spacetime without a semiclassical baby universe. This result assumes only that AdS/CFT admits an extrapolate dictionary and an asymptotically isometric encoding of the causal wedge into the dual CFT, without which the correspondence may well be vacuous.</description>

      <title>Symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after an inhomogeneous quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Kinematic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a geometric organization of the differential equations for the wavefunction coefficients of
  conformally coupled scalars in power-law cosmologies. To do this, we introduce a basis of functions
  inspired by a decomposition of the wavefunction into time-ordered components. Representing these basis
  functions and their singularities by graph tubings, we show that a remarkably simple rule for the merger
  of tubes produces the differential equations for arbitrary tree graphs (and loop integrands). We find that
  the basis functions can be assigned to the vertices, edges, and facets of convex geometries (in the simplest
  cases, collections of hypercubes) which capture the compatibility of mergers and define how the basis
  functions are coupled in the differential equations. This organization of functions also simplifies solving
  the differential equations. The merger of tubes is shown to reflect the causal properties of bulk physics,
  in particular the collapse of time-ordered propagators. Taken together, these observations demystify the
  origin of the kinematic flow observed in these equations [1].</description>

Abstract: Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in an external non-Abelian gauge field with an SU(N) symmetry group have been obtained. The external field is a solution of the Yang-Mills equations and describes a plane wave on the light cone. The obtained solutions form a complete set and can be used in the procedure of canonical quantization of scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Note on Type $III_1$ Algebras in $ c= 1$ String Theory and Bulk Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the Leutheusser-Liu procedure of isolating a von Neumann algebra in the $N = \infty$ limit of string theories, leads to the algebra of relativistic fermion fields on a half line for the $c = 1$ string theory. This is a Type $I$ von Neumann algebra, since it is the algebra of the Rindler wedge in the Rindler vacuum state. Subalgebras of finite regions are Type $III_1$. The argument uses the elegant results of Moore and of Alexandrov, Kazakov and Kostov. This model is well known to be integrable and have no black hole excitations. We have speculated that adding an interaction invisible in perturbation theory to a large finite number, $M$, of copies of the model, produces a non-integrable model with meta-stable excitations having all of the properties of linear dilaton black holes. The algebra of fields is the tensor product of $M$ copies of the $c = 1$ model's algebra, whether or not we add the non-integrable interaction. We argue that the infinite dimensional $c = 1$ algebras are analogous to those of the boundary field theory in AdS/CFT, even though they appear to encode bulk causal structure. An IR cutoff on the boundary renders them finite and causal structure must be formulated in terms of an analog of the Tensor Network Renormalization Group. This is a time dependent Hamiltonian flow, embedding smaller Hilbert spaces into larger ones. It is the analog of one sided modular inclusion in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: from Wigner degeneracy to Elko fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field, a quantum field framework for spin-1/2 fermions that exhibit a Wigner doublet -- a discrete quantum number arising from nontrivial representations of the extended Poincar\'{e} group. In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM.</description>

      <title>Evolution of self-gravitating spherical dark-matter halos with and without new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical algorithm for evolving self-gravitating systems of dark-matter particles that leverages the assumption of spherical symmetry to reduce the nominally six-dimensional phase space to three dimensions. It can be used to quickly determine numerically the evolution of an initially static stable self-consistent self-gravitating system if there is some additional or new physics. We illustrate here with four examples: (1) the effects of the growth of a supermassive black hole at the center; (2) the effects of stripping of the outer layers of the halo (a toy model for the effects of tidal stripping of galaxies); (3) the response of a self-gravitating system to dark matter that decays to a slightly less massive state; and (4) the effects of a slow change to Newton's constant. The approach can be extended to study dark matter with elastic and inelastic self-interactions and to study the process of virialization in spherical collapse. We describe some aspects of a code NSphere that implements this approach which we are making available.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Reflection Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100\,ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a \textit{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (\textit{LISA}) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for \textit{LISA} precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.</description>

      <title>Description of the eikonal limit of a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ is studied in the eikonal limit, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, studied in \cite{stelle1}-\cite{modesto4}. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears enhanced. However, for these new models, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, as the introduction of new scales may change the allowed center of mass and impulse transfer scales. This issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work however should be taken with a grain of salt, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. We believe nevertheless, that they are reasonable. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, the next order does not vanish and in fact it is divergent and has to be regularized. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Quasiparticles, Retarded Correlators and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic theory provides a powerful framework for investigating macroscopic and microscopic properties of weakly and strongly interacting plasmas. By assuming a constant mass profile within the kinetic theory approach, we examine the collective behavior of a system of massive relativistic particles within the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency values. To obtain analytical results, we expand relations for very small and large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). For large ratios, no significant effects are observed in the charge, shear, or sound propagation channels. However, for small ratios in the charge correlation function within the hydrodynamic limit, the mass tends to shift the hydrodynamic poles toward the unstable region, i.e., $\text{Im}(\omega) \geq 0$. This instability emerges at a critical value of $(m/T)_c \simeq 1.234$. Furthermore, in the sound channel, the mass amplifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely (positive) imaginary mode. Consequently, all modes in this channel become purely imaginary, with instability becoming a dominant characteristic. In contrast, in the shear channel, all modes converge to their massless limits. Similar to the massless case, a threshold value exists for $(k \tau)$, below which the correlators exhibit solutions. We find that hydrodynamic poles arise in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut between $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$ that is analogous to the massless scenario. Additionally, we derive the shear and bulk viscosity transport coefficients, along with other coefficients up to third order in gradients, as an expansion in terms of small $(m/T)$.</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spin-flavor oscillations of neutrinos in a magnetic field within the quantum field theory approach in which neutrinos are virtual particles. Neutrinos are taken to be Majorana particles having a nonzero transition magnetic moment. We derive the dressed propagators of the neutrino mass eigenstates exactly accounting for the magnetic field contribution. The matrix element and the transition probability for spin-flavor oscillations are obtained. The leading term in the transition probability is shown to coincide with the result of the standard quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations. We also derive the correction to the transition probability which has the quantum field theory origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider one-loop corrections to a recently obtained form of Starobinsky inflation in Jordan frame to extract information about the initial conditions of the universe leading to cosmological inflation. Integrating out graviton modes, we find higher-derivative instabilities that are shown to decay into scalarons and causing an effective kinetic-domination stage where the universe behaves as a stiff fluid. Through slow cosmological expansion, the kination stage leads to inflation. We find a natural cut-off for the scalaron magnitude ensuring positivity of the modified kinetic term which matches Planck constraints on inflaton energy density at the pivot scale. We, then, backtrack to find that even for arbitrary initial conditions, kination naturally leads to the inflationary epoch without the need for fine-tuning. Modifications to the scalar power spectrum are also shown to potentially explain low-$l$ anomaly in CMB observations as well as the updated prediction of spectral index $\approx0.9743$ accounting for data from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approximation scheme to calculate general $n$-point $HSSA$ of open bosonic string theory. This stringy scaling loop expansion contains finite number of vacuum diagram terms at each loop order of scattering energy due to a vacuum diagram contraint and a topological graph constraint. In addition, we calculate coefficient and give the vacuum diagram representation and its Feynman rules for each term in the expansion of the $HSSA$. As an application to extending our previous calculation of $n$-point leading order stringy scaling behavior of $HSSA$, we explicitly calculate some examples of $4$-point next to leading order stringy scaling violation terms.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general dynamical, spherically symmetric background in the cubic subclass of Horndeski theory and obtain the quadratic action for the perturbations using the DPSV approach. We analyse the stability conditions for high-energy modes and study the issue of the no-go theorem in the current subclass of Horndeski theory. We formulate the no-go theorem for weak dependence on one variable (time or radial) and derive its generalization to the cases which could be reduced by coordinate transformation to scenarios where the scalar field has weak dependence on one of the coordinates. Moreover we show that wide class of singular solutions are also prohibited within the cubic subclass of Horndeski theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode rich information about physics at the Hubble scale and may exhibit characteristic oscillatory signals due to the exchange of massive particles. Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break de Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various particle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these correlators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry. In this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation to the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first step, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological correlators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local signals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed in previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV divergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly canceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure in flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop correlators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for the covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated from a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double Liouville String</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the double Liouville theory, which can be thought of as a two-parameter family of marginal deformations of the so-called Virasoro Minimal String (VMS). The latter consists of a timelike ($c_{-}&lt;1$) and a spacelike ($c_{+}&gt;25$) Liouville field theory formulated on a fluctuating Riemann surface. For the deformed theory, we compute the sphere partition function exactly in $1/c_{\pm}$ and at third order in the coupling constant ($\lambda $) that controls the deformation. We also discuss the analogous computation in the case of the Complex Liouville String (CLS) theory, which is defined as two spacelike Liouville theories with complex central charges $c_{\pm }=13\pm i\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$. We show that the partition functions of VMS and CLS differ at leading order in $\lambda $ due to the presence of elliptic functions in the observables of the latter. Both VMS and CLS theories have recently been studied in relation to many interesting models, including the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, matrix models, and de Sitter gravity in 2 and 3 dimensions. We comment on the interpretation of the marginal deformation in some of these contexts.</description>

      <title>Two Micron-Size Dark Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two extra dimensions of micron scale might simultaneously address the gauge and cosmological hierarchy problems. In our paper we examine various observational bounds in scenarios with one and two large extra dimensions, to see if they are compatible with the micron scale. We show that consistency with astrophysical observations requires that two extra dimensions of micron scale must not admit isometries, whereby conservation of the extra dimensional momentum is violated, allowing the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton to decay to other lighter graviton modes. However, to remain consistent with cosmological observations two extra dimensions of micron scale require a delicately fine tuning of the temperature at which the universe enters the radiation dominated epoch. Diving into this fine-tuned scenario we also show that primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^8 &lt;M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} &lt;10^{21}$ could make all cosmological dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant effective actions for dressed fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new fundamental form of the path integral for theories with local symmetry is introduced. It is utilised to construct effective actions that generate correlation functions of dressed fields in Yang-Mills theories and quantum gravity. The construction entails a novel BRST symmetric gauge fixing which imposes that the on-shell correlation functions are those of gauge invariant fields. We demonstrate that the effective actions are gauge and diffeomorphism invariant respectively, with appropriate transformations for the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and Nakanishi-Lautrup fields. As a consistency check, the on-shell one-loop effective actions are shown to take the expected gauge independent form. The effective action which satisfies Zinn-Justin's master equation is also gauge invariant with the anti-fields transforming accordingly. While our choice of gauge will in general be non-linear and non-local, we argue that these gauges are in fact stable under renormalisation if one allows for general renormalised field variables.</description>

      <title>Riccati-type pseudo-potential approach to quasi-integrability of deformed soliton theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review paper explores the Riccati-type pseudo-potential formulation applied to the quasi-integrable sine-Gordon, KdV, and NLS models. The proposed framework provides a unified methodology for analyzing quasi-integrability properties across various integrable systems, including deformations of the sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd, Toda, KdV, pKdV, NLS and SUSY sine-Gordon models. Key findings include the emergence of infinite towers of anomalous conservation laws within the Riccati-type approach and the identification of exact non-local conservation laws in the linear formulations of deformed models. As modified integrable models play a crucial role in diverse fields of nonlinear physics-such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, gravity models, optics and soliton turbulence-these results may have far-reaching applications.</description>

      <title>Anomaly resolution by non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize previous results on anomaly resolution to noninvertible symmetries. Briefly, given a global symmetry G of some theory with a 't Hooft anomaly rendering it ungaugeable, the idea of anomaly resolution is to extend G to a larger anomaly-free symmetry of the same theory with a trivially-acting kernel. In previous work, several of the coauthors demonstrated that in two-dimensional theories, by virtue of decomposition, gauging the larger symmetry is equivalent to a disjoint union of theories in which a nonanomalous subgroup of G is gauged. In this paper, we consider examples in which the larger symmetry is not a group, but instead a noninvertible symmetry defined by some fusion category. In principle the same ideas apply to the case that G itself is noninvertible. We discuss the construction of larger symmetries using both SymTFT methods as well as algebraically via (quasi-)Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We analytically show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>

      <title>On Refined Vogel's universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. In particular, this means that various quantities in the adjoint representations of these simple Lie algebras such as dimensions and quantum dimensions, Racah coefficients, etc. are simple rational functions of two parameters on Vogel's plane, giving three lines associated with $sl$, $so/sp$ and exceptional algebras correspondingly. By analyzing the partition function of refined of Chern-Simons theory, it was suggested earlier that the refinement may preserve the universality for simply laced algebras. Here we support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector: there is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebras as a function on the Vogel's plane.</description>

      <title>Study of transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and the heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation using a novel approximation method. Following the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model, we have proposed a novel Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model with a modified collision integral to carry out the aforementioned study. We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

Abstract: Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke predicted that the hyperk\"ahler Ooguri-Vafa space $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ should provide a local model for Hitchin moduli spaces near the discriminant locus. To this end, Tulli identified $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ with a certain space of framed Higgs bundles with an irregular singularity. We extend this result by identifying the Ooguri-Vafa holomorphic symplectic form with a regularized version of the Atiyah-Bott form on the associated space of framed connections. We also prove the analogous statement for the corresponding semiflat forms. Finally, restricting to the Hitchin section, we identify a regularized version of Hitchin's $L^2$-metric with the Ooguri-Vafa metric.</description>

      <title>The complexity of entanglement embezzlement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement is the counterintuitive process in which entanglement is extracted from a resource system using local unitary operations, with almost no detectable change in the resource's state. It has recently been argued that any state of a relativistic quantum field theory can serve as a resource for perfect embezzlement. We study the circuit complexity of embezzlement, using sequences of states that enable arbitrary precision for the process, commonly called universal embezzling families. In addition, we argue that this approach provides a well-defined model for the complexity of embezzlement from quantum field theories. Under fairly general assumptions, we establish a generic lower bound on the complexity, which increases with the precision of the process or embezzled entanglement, and diverges as these become infinite. As an example, we consider a $1d$ critical system as the resource and derive an exponentially growing lower bound on the complexity. Consequently, the findings imply that circuit complexity acts as a physical obstruction to perfect embezzlement. Supplementary to the main results, we derive lower bounds for common models of circuit complexity for state preparation, based on the difference between the Schatten norms of the initial and final states.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics -- which, not surprisingly, proves to be inadequate in the strong field regime characterizing the vicinity of the singularity -- but also in the physical one in which the field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description. In addition to the expected divergent outcome with regard to the field amplitudes and power flux as the waves approach the singularity, we found a number of regular (bounded) solutions which seem to coexist with the unbridled effects of the spacetime curvature. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularity, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it.</description>

      <title>Quantum analysis of the effects of coordinate noncommutativity on bi-dimensional harmonic motion under parametric variations</title>

Abstract: In high-energy physics, coordinate noncommutativity represents the core idea that space itself can be quantized, as expressed through the frameworks of string theory and noncommutative field theory. Influence of such a noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, is investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schr\"odinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Beta function without UV divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>
