      <title>Projection-to-Born-improved Subtractions at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the current frontier in fixed-order precision for collider observables is N$^3$LO, important steps are necessary to consolidate NNLO cross-section predictions with improved stability and efficiency. Slicing methods have been successfully applied to obtain NNLO and N$^3$LO predictions, but have shown poor performance in the presence of fiducial cuts due to large kinematical power corrections. In this paper we implement Projection-to-Born-improved $q_T$ (P2B $q_T$) and jettiness (P2B $\tau_0$) subtractions for a large class of color singlet processes in MCFM. This method allows for the efficient evaluation of \emph{fiducial} power corrections in any non-local subtraction scheme using a Projection-to-Born subtraction. We demonstrate the significant numerical improvements of this method based on fiducial Drell-Yan and Higgs cross-sections. Moreover, with fiducial power corrections removed via this method, the leading-logarithmic power corrections that have only been calculated without fiducial cuts can be included, further improving the calculations. For di-photon production with photon isolation, we devise a novel method in combination with P2B-improved subtractions, which we name $P2B_\gamma$ $\tau_0$, and $P2B_\gamma$ $q_T$ for the two subtraction schemes, respectively. This method allows the inclusion of both fiducial power corrections due to kinematic cuts on the photons and a set of isolation power corrections in the fragmentation channel where a quark may enter the isolation cone. We find significant improvements in the convergence of NNLO di-photon cross-sections with photon isolation cuts, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve a stable and efficient calculation of di-photon cross-sections using slicing methods.</description>

      <title>General Quartic $\beta$-Function at Three Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the three-loop $\overline{\text{MS}}$ quartic $ \beta $-function for the most general renormalisable four-dimensional theories. A general parametrization of the $ \beta $-function is compared to known $ \beta $-functions for specific theories to fix all coefficients. Three-loop $ \beta $-functions for the cubic coupling and scalar mass terms also follow from the result, which is made available in software packages.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A muon collider represents a promising candidate for the next generation of particle physics experiments after the expected end of LHC operations in the early 2040s. Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the production of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider. We present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in H to ZZ to 4l events at a potential future muon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be reconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson decays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain the expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum entanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be maximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with high significance.</description>

      <title>Search for Light $H^+$ via $e^+e^- \to H^+H^- \to c\bar b\bar cb$ @ ILC500</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current {\it impasse}: no new physics seen beyond the $h(125)$ boson. We advocate the {\it general} two Higgs doublet model without $Z_2$ symmetry, allowing extra Yukawa couplings, where we present 5 clear merits. We report on the search effort at LHC for $pp \to tt\bar
  c$, then on the new effort of $pp \to bH^+ \to bt\bar b$ search for $H^+$, and comment on our \underline{\bf Decadal Mission} program in Taiwan. Finally, we turn to the $e^+e^- \to H^+H^-
  \to c\bar b\bar cb$ program at ILC500 as a {\it what-if} situation at the LHC, demonstrating light $H^+$ reconstruction without $c$-tagging. We then end with discussion and conclusion.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <title>Zh Production, a Tool to Constrain 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the SM Higgs boson, h, is the superposition of two unequal-mass neutral Higgs bosons in 2HDM, therefore the associated production cross section for h and Z in SM and 2HDM can be different. In this paper, the possibility of using this difference to discover or constrain 2HDM is studied. As a main result, the allowed parameter space of 2HDM type-II is found in the light of possible precise measurements from the LHC experiments. It is shown that combination of the constraints from these measurements with the previous constraints on 2HDM, from direct search and flavour physics, can rule out the main part of the 2HDM parameter space.</description>

      <title>TMD evolution effect on $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in a back-to-back production of $J/\psi$ and jet at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A back-to-back semi-inclusive $J/\psi + jet$ production is a promising process to study gluon transverse momentum distribution (TMDs) at the future electron-ion collider (EIC). A back-to-back configuration allows a higher transverse momentum for $J/\psi$. We present an extension of a previous work where we studied $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry within the TMD factorization framework for this process. We present and compare the effect of TMD evolution on the asymmetry, in two approaches that differ in the parameterization of the perturbative tails of the TMDs and the non-perturbative factors. We show that the asymmetry depends on the parameterizations of the non-perturbative Sudakov factors in the larger $b_T$ region and on the perturbative part of the evolution kernel. We use NRQCD to estimate the $J/\psi$ production and show the effect of using different long-distance matrix element (LDME) sets. Overall, the asymmetry after incorporating TMD evolution is small, but increases with the transverse momentum imbalance of the $J/\psi$-jet pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the relic density of dark matter in the non-standard cosmological scenarios which includes kination models, brane world cosmology and shear dominated universe. Then we use the Planck data to find constraints on the parameter spaces as dark matter cross sections and the five dimentional Planck mass for brane cosmology, enhancement factor for kination model and the inverse-scaled shear temperature for shear dominated universe.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the determinations of the QCD condensates within the SVZ expansion in the axial-vector (A) channel using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ within stability criteria and $\tau$-like higher moments ${R}_{n,A}$ within stability for arbitrary $\tau$-mass squared $s_0$. We find the same violation of the factorization by a factor 6 of the four-quark condensate as from $e^+e^- \to$ Hadrons data. One can notice a systematic alternate sign and no exponential growth of the size of these condensates. Then, we extract $\alpha_s$ from the lowest $\tau$-decay like moment and find: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V+A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V+A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We extend the analysis to the V+A channel and find: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V+A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V+A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We observe that in different channels ($e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons, \, A,\,V+A), the extraction of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ at the observed $\tau$-mass leads to an overestimate of its value. Our determinations from these different channels lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3140(44)$ (FO) and 0.3346 (35) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1178(6)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1202(4)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$(CI). Comparisons with some other results are done.</description>

      <title>Leptonic dipole operator with $\Gamma_2$ modular invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the leptonic EDM and the LFV decays relating with the recent data of anomalous magnetic moment of muon, $(g-2)_{\mu}$, in the framework of the SMEFT with the Stringy Ansatz. We have adopted the successful $\Gamma_2$ modular invariant model by Meloni-Parriciatu as the flavor symmetry of leptons. Suppose the anomaly of $(g-2)_{\mu}$, $\Delta a_{\mu}$ to be evidence of New Physics (NP), we have related it with the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron $\Delta a_e$, the electron EDM $d_e$ and the $\mu\to e \gamma$ decay. We found that the NP contributions to $\Delta a_{e(\mu)}$ are proportional to the lepton masses squared likewise the naive scaling $\Delta a_\ell \propto m^2_\ell$. The experimental constraint of $|d_e|$ is much tight compared with the one from the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)$ in our framework. Supposing the phase of our model parameter $\delta_{\alpha}$ for the electron to be of order one, we have estimated the upper-bound of $\mathcal{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)$, which is at most $10^{-21}-10^{-20}$. If the model parameters $\delta_{\alpha}$, $\delta_{\beta}$ (for muon) and $\delta_{\gamma}$ (for tauon) are real, leptonic EDMs vanish since the CP phase of the modular form due to modulus $\tau$ does not contribute to the EDM. However, we can obtain $\mathcal{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)\simeq 10^{-13}$ with non-vanishing $d_e$, that is the case, only $\delta_{\alpha}$ is real while the others are complex. Then, the imaginary part of $\delta_{\beta}$ can lead to $d_e$ in the next-to-leading contribution. The predicted electron EDM is below $10^{-32}$e\,cm, while $\mathcal{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)$ is close to the experimental upper-bound. The predicted upper-bound of $|d_\mu|$ is rather large, around $10^{-23}$e\,cm and of $|d_\tau|$ is $ 10^{-22}$e\,cm. The branching ratios of $\tau\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to \mu\gamma$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Study of gluon GPDs in exclusive $J/\psi$ production in electron-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive photoproduction of heavy $J/\psi$ meson is performed within handbag factorization method. The General Parton Distributions (GPDs) for gluons which are an essential ingredient here, are constructed using double distribution (DD) representation. The calculated cross section for few sets of gluon GPDs $H_g$ describe fine $J/\psi$ production experimental data from HERA to LHC energies. Based on this approach we estimate $J/\psi$ spin asymmetries determined by $E_g$ and $\tilde{H}_g$. The GPDs factorization approach can be employed to analyse heavy vector meson production in electron-proton scattering. Investigations of this reactions at future electron-ion colliders in USA and China can give an essential information on gluon GPDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the production of $X(4630)$ and $Y(4626)$ in $B^+$ and $B_s^0$ decays, where $X(4630)$ and $Y(4626)$ are considered as the $C-$ parity pigeon pair in the $D_{s}^{\ast+} D_{s1}(2536)^-$ molecular frame. The branching fractions of $B^+ \to K^+ X(4630)/Y(4626)$ and $B_s^0 \to \eta X(4630)/Y(4626)$ have been evaluated using an effective Lagrangian approach, which are of the order of $10^{-5}$ and the ratios of these branching fractions are almost independent on the model parameter. Based on the present estimations, we propose to search $Y(4626)$ in the process $B^+ \to K^+ J/\psi \eta^{(\prime)}$, which should be accessible by the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations.</description>

      <title>Cross Sections and Inelasticity Distributions of High-Energy Neutrino Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive model for neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) cross sections spanning energies from 50 GeV to 5$\times10^{12}$ GeV with an emphasis on applications to neutrino telescopes. We provide calculations of the total charged-current DIS cross sections and inelasticity distributions up to NNLO for isoscalar nucleon targets and up to NLO order for nuclear targets. Several modifications to the structure functions are applied to improve the modeling of the cross sections at low energies where perturbative QCD is less accurate and at high energies where there is non-negligible top quark production, and small-$x$ logarithms need to be resumed. Using the FONLL general-mass variable-flavor number scheme, we account for heavy quark mass effects and separate the heavy flavor components of the structure functions, obtaining predictions of their relative contributions to the cross sections and the uncertainties arising from the parton distribution functions. Additionally, the effects of final state radiation are implemented in the calculation of the double-differential cross section and discussed in terms of their impact on measurements at neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>A minimal neutrino oscillation affected QCD axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the KSVZ axion model and the type-I seesaw mechanism, we construct a minimal axion model that may affect the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation. This minimal model requires flavor mixed axion-neutrinos interactions and two additional standard model (SM) singlet scalars which generate specific patterns of lepton mass matrices. These patterns yield a particular texture of Majorana neutrino mass matrix. We find that this texture, combined with existing neutrino experimental data, predicts an Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses with $17\lesssim m_1/m_3\lesssim 44$, and a hierarchy between the two VEVs of SM-singlet scalars. Finally, we examine the potential effect of this model on neutrino oscillation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Could the newly reported $X(2600)$ be the $\eta_2(4D)$ meson?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently reported the observation of the $X(2600)$ state in the $\eta^\prime \pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi \to \gamma \eta^\prime \pi^+\pi^-$, with a significance exceeding $20\sigma$. Its $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers could be either $0^{-+}$ or $2^{-+}$. We explore the possibility of the $X(2600)$ being a higher state of the $\eta_2$ meson family. Through ($n,M^2$) trajectory analysis and the Quark Pair Creation model, we propose that the $X(2600)$ could be the third radial excitation of the $\eta_2(1870)$. However, the theoretical decay width of the $\eta_2(4D)$ is smaller than the experimental width of the $X(2600)$, and branching ratio calculations suggest inconsistencies, leading us to exclude the $X(2600)$ as the $\eta_2(4D)$. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the $X(2600)$ and provide insights for future experimental searches for excited the $\eta_2$ states.</description>

Partial wave analysis can be applied to reveal the momentum spectral structure and identify the positions of valleys/peaks of the multiphoton rings by combining with $CP$ conservation. Moreover, considering the spin states of created pairs in partial wave analysis, the particle orbital angular momentum associated with the valleys/peaks can also be identified from multiphoton rings. It is found that the results for angular distribution by this approximate analytical treatment and by the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism are consistent with each other. The present results are helpful for understanding the angular momentum information in momentum spectra, and they also have an implication for revealing the vortex structure near the valleys.</description>

      <title>Searching for light long-lived particles at SHiNESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Soleti et al.~[\textit{JHEP03(2024)148}] proposed a new experiment called SHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use of the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search for hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise with distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron pairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs).At the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays of $\pi^+$ mesons at rest and decays of $\mu^+$ leptons.We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of long-lived light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived weak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced from decays of $\pi^+$ and $\mu^+$.Since the $\pi^+$'s decay at rest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced $\mu^+$'s or LLPs, and thus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these two scenarios.Our calculation shows that in most of the relevant benchmark scenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the existing bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.</description>

      <title>Logic and numbers related to solar neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, first of all, we analyze a number of hidden aspects of the concept of particle oscillations. The key element of this concept, which do not comply with the principle of least action, is the notion of a mixture of particles, introduced by Gell-Mann and Pais for neutral $K$-mesons. It has been proven that the law of conservation of energy-momentum in the processes of electron neutrino production does not allow solving the problem of solar neutrinos based on the assumption of Gribov and Pontecorvo about their oscillations. It has been established that the consequences of Wolfenstein's equation contradict the results of the SNO and Super-Kamiokande collaborations and that the assertion by Mikheev and Smirnov on the conversion of solar neutrinos is erroneous. Another part of the work is devoted to a logically clear solution to this problem based on the hypothesis of the existence of a new interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson, which has a Yukawa coupling with electron neutrinos and nucleons. At each act of interaction of an electron neutrino with the nucleons of the Sun, caused by such interaction, the handedness of the neutrino changes from left to right and vice versa, and also the neutrino energy decreases. The hypothesis provides good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the rates of all five observed processes with solar neutrinos. This serves as a significant criterion for both the confidence of such a solution to the problem of solar neutrinos and the confidence of the existence of a new interaction.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative four-gluon vertex in soft kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative study of the form factor associated with the projection of the full four-gluon vertex on its classical tensor, for a set of kinematics with one vanishing and three arbitrary external momenta. The treatment is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing this vertex, and a large-volume lattice simulation, involving ten thousand gauge field configurations. The key hypothesis employed in both approaches is the ``planar degeneracy'', which classifies diverse configurations by means of a single variable, thus enabling their meaningful ``averaging''. The results of both approaches show notable agreement, revealing a considerable suppression of the averaged form factor in the infrared. The deviations from the exact planar degeneracy are discussed in detail, and a supplementary variable is used to achieve a more accurate description. The effective charge defined through this special form factor is computed within both approaches, and the results obtained are in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Boson propagator under rigid rotation; Mode expansion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore how rigid rotation affects the thermodynamic properties of free relativistic bosons, we employ the standard imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory to calculate the free propagator of complex scalar fields under rotation. We introduce the corresponding partition function and explicitly compute it by expanding the modes in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting propagator is in full agreement with similar findings in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>One-loop impact factors for heavy quarkonium production: $S$-wave case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim to extend the study of inclusive heavy quarkonium production at forward rapidities with the resummation of high partinic center-of-momentum-energy logarithms beyond Leading Logarithmic Approximation (LLA), the explicit analytic results for one-loop corrections to the following impact factors had been obtained: $\gamma R \to Q\bar{Q}\left[^1S_0^{[8]} \right]$, $g R \to Q\bar{Q}\left[^1S_0^{[1]} \right]$, $gR\to Q\bar{Q}\left[ ^1S_0^{[8]} \right]$ and $gR\to Q\bar{Q}\left[ ^3S_1^{[8]}\right]$, with $R$ being the Reggeized gluon and $Q$ is the heavy quark. The computation is done in the framework of Lipatov's gauge-invariant EFT for Multi-Regge processes in QCD with the tilted-Wilson-line regularisation for rapidity divergences. As expected, only single-logarithmic rapidity divergence proportional to the one-loop Regge trajetory of a gluon remains in the final result for impact-factors. Numerical comparison with Regge limits ($s/(-t) \gg 1$) of one-loop QCD amplitudes, described in the paper, provides a strong cross-check of obtained results. The relations of obtained results with other regularisation schemes for rapidity divergences used in low-$x$ physics, such as BFKL scheme, High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) scheme and shockwave scheme, are given.</description>

Abstract: We analyze data from the CsI, liquid Ar and Ge detectors of the COHERENT experiment and confirm within $1.5\sigma$ that the measured elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus, as expected for coherent scattering in the standard model. We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard neutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three datasets.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Lepton Number Violation in the Left-Right Symmetric Model: $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, M{\o}ller scattering, and collider searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the left-right symmetric model, we study the interplay of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, parity-violating M{\o}ller scattering, and high-energy colliders, resulting from the Yukawa interaction of the right-handed doubly-charged scalar to electrons, which could evade the severe constraints from charged lepton flavor violation. The $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay amplitude receives additional contributions from right-handed sterile neutrinos. The half-life, calculated in the effective field theory (EFT) framework, allows for an improved description of the contributions involving non-zero mixing between left- and right-handed $W$ bosons and those arising from exchanging a light right-handed neutrino. We find that the relative sensitivities between the low-energy (or high-precision) and high-energy experiments are affected by the left-right mixing. On the other hand, our results show how the interplay of collider and low-energy searches provides a manner to explore regions that are inaccessible to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.</description>

      <title>On the finite basis topologies for multi-loop high-multiplicity Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically analyse Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme. We write an explicit reduction resulting from partial fractioning the high-multiplicity integrands to a finite basis of topologies at any given loop order. We find all of these finite basis topologies at two loops in four external dimensions. Their maximal cut and the leading singularity are expressed in terms of the Gram determinant and Baikov polynomial. By performing an Integration-By-Parts reduction without any cut constraint on a numerical probe for one of these topologies, we show that the computational complexity drops significantly compared to the Conventional Dimensional Regularization scheme. Formally, our work implies an upper bound on the rigidity of special functions appearing in the iterated integral solutions at each loop order in perturbative Quantum Field Theory. Phenomenologically, the integrand-level reduction we present will substantially simplify the task of providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical string fragmentation and QGP-like effects in jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed to search for thermal and collective properties arising from parton-fragmentation processes by examining high jet charged-constituent multiplicities ($N_{\rm j,ch}$) in proton-proton (pp) collisions. This proposal was initially tested using the PYTHIA 8 event generator with the Monash tune, which incorporates multiparton interactions (MPI) and the MPI-based colour reconnection (CR) model. These studies did not reveal any strangeness enhancement, nor provide conclusive evidence for the presence of radial flow. In this letter, we expand upon the proposed Monte Carlo study by eliminating selection biases associated with triggering on charged particle multiplicities. Furthermore, MPI are disabled to focus exclusively on jet fragments. We analyse pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV simulated with PYTHIA 8, exploring different implementations of the generator: thermodynamical string fragmentation and the standard Lund fragmentation model, considering various CR models. Surprisingly, the thermodynamical string fragmentation model predicts a hint of strangeness enhancement in jets. Additionally, the light-flavor baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of $j_{\rm T}$ exhibit similarities across all PYTHIA 8 implementations, and hint at radial flow-like effects. In contrast, the ratio of heavy-flavor hadrons (${\Lambda_{\rm c}^+}/{\rm D^0}$) at low $j_{\rm T}$ as a function of $N_{\rm j,ch}$ shows a similar trend to that observed as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in soft data, suggesting that colour string junctions may play an important role in jet development.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Magnetar Fields: Chiral Magnetic Instability in Neutron Star Crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral magnetic instability in the crust of a neutron star as a potential mechanism for amplifying magnetic fields. This instability may become active when small deviations from chemical equilibrium are sustained over decades, driven by the star's gradual spin-down or residual heat loss. Our findings suggest that this mechanism can produce strong, large-scale magnetic fields consistent with models that align with observational data. Additionally, this instability naturally generates magnetic helicity in the star's crust, which is crucial for forming and maintaining strong dipolar toroidal fields, often invoked to explain magnetar observational phenomena. Our results offer a microphysically-based alternative to classical hydrodynamical dynamos for the origin of magnetar magnetic fields, addressing a long-standing debate in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of analytic models for a dark matter halo surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole sitting at the center of a galaxy, with a variable inner radius $r_{\text{in}}$, at which the density profile of the dark matter halo vanishes. We examine in detail how the three energy conditions are satisfied in such models. In particular, we find that the three energy conditions are satisfied when $r_{\text{in}} &gt; 5M/2$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the black hole. These solutions expressed explicitly in closed form are particularly valuable for the studies of the gravitational waveforms of extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspirals and the nature of dark matter in galaxies.</description>

Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Interacting Models of Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the interacting models between the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field and the dark matter fluid in a homogeneous and isotropic background. A key feature of GB coupling models is the varying speed of gravitational waves (GWs). We utilize recent constraints on the GW speed and conduct our analysis in two primary scenarios: model-dependent and model-independent. In the model-dependent scenario, where determining the GW speed requires a specific GB coupling functional form, we choose an exponential GB coupling. We adopt a dynamical system analysis to obtain the necessary constraints on the model parameters that describe different phases of the universe and produce a stable late-time accelerating solution following the GW constraint, and find that to satisfy all these constraints, fine-tuning of the free parameters involved in the models is often needed. In the model-independent scenario, the GW speed is fixed to one, and we construct the autonomous system to identify the late-time stable accelerating critical points. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian inference method using late-time observational data sets, including 31 data points from cosmic chronometer data (Hubble data) and 1701 data points from Pantheon+ and find that all the observational constraints can be satisfied without fine-tuning. In addition, we also utilize simulated binned Roman and LSST data to study the evolution of the universe in the model-independent scenario. We find that the model shows significant deviation at higher redshifts from $\Lambda$CDM and fits the current data much better than $\Lambda$CDM within the error bars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magntic blackhole.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases.The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Free Streaming in Warm Wave Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for numerically computing the effects of free-streaming in scalar fields produced after inflation. First, we provide a detailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This prescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on subhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and importantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations on large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We then evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation, including the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations. We show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially adiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying, non-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we explore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field, including oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this paper, we make our code, ${\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\sf{CFL}}$), publicly available. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly relevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Modified Trento initial condition and its impact on collective flows and global polarization in Cu+Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective flow coefficients and spin polarization are valuable probes of the geometry and flow velocity field of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a modified TRENTo initial condition coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional (D) viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc, we study the directed flow and elliptic flow coefficients of hadrons, together with the global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons in asymmetric Cu+Au collisions. We extend the 2D TRENTo model to the 3D space, and find that the initial tilted geometry of the QGP fireball with respect to the longitudinal direction leads to a decrease of directed flow from positive to negative values with increasing pseudorapidity, an enhancement of elliptic flow at forward and backward pseudorapidities, and a non-monotonic dependence of global polarization on the transverse momentum of hyperons. The initial longitudinal flow velocity gradient further enhances the values of directed flow and global polarization. Our model calculation provides a satisfactory description of the rapidity, transverse momentum, and centrality dependences of the directed flow of charged hadrons in Cu+Au collisions for the first time, and proposes that such asymmetric heavy-ion collisions create a better environment for studying the initial tilted geometry and longitudinal flow field of the QGP than symmetric Au+Au collisions do.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation in Generalized Brans Dicke Theory: Compact Binary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generation and properties of
  gravitational radiation within the framework of Generalized
  Brans-Dicke (GBD) theory, with a specific emphasis on its
  manifestation in compact binary systems. The primary focus of this study lies in the
  comprehensive exploration of gravitational radiation generated by
  compact binaries. The energy momentum tensor and the associated
  gravitational wave (GW) radiation power in GBD theory are
  investigated, elucidating the relationship between these
  fundamental concepts. Furthermore, detailed calculations are
  provided for the GW radiation power originating from both tensor
  fields and scalar fields. Based on our calculations, both scalar
  fields contribute to GW radiation by producing dipole radiation.
  We also study the period derivative of compact binaries in this
  theory. By comparing with the observational data of the orbital
  period derivative of the quasicircular white dwarf-neutron star
  binary PSR J1012+5307, we put bounds on the two parameters of the
  theory: the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_{0}$ and the
  mass of geometrical scalar field $m_f$, \textcolor{black}{resulting
  in a lower bound $\omega_{0}&gt;6.09723\times10^6$ for a massless BD
  scalar field and the geometrical field whose mass is smaller than
  $10^{-29} \text{GeV}$. The obtained bound on $\omega_0$ is two
  orders of magnitude stricter than those derived from solar system
  data.} Finally, we find the phase shift that GWs experience in the
  frequency domain during their propagation.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties from Gribov Copies in Lattice Calculation of Parton Distributions in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed to compute parton distributions from boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory. This method does not involve Wilson lines and could greatly improve the efficiency and precision of lattice QCD calculations. However, there are concerns about whether the systematic uncertainties from Gribov copies, which correspond to the ambiguity in lattice gauge-fixing, are under control. This work gives an assessment of the Gribov copies' effect in the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlators. We utilize different strategies for the Coulomb-gauge fixing, selecting two different groups of Gribov copies based on the lattice gauge configurations. We test the difference in the resulted spatial quark correlators in the vacuum and a pion state. Our findings indicate that the statistical errors of the matrix elements from both Gribov copies, regardless of the correlation range, decrease proportionally to the square root of the number of gauge configurations. The difference between the strategies does not show statistical significance compared to the gauge noise. This demonstrates that the effect of the Gribov copies can be neglected in the practical lattice calculation of the quark parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Isotropization by shock waves generation in anisotropic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) has proven successful in modeling the evolution of quark-gluon matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic description of quark-gluon plasma has also been widely used to study sound phenomena, such as shock waves. It has recently been shown that initial fluctuations in energy density and supersonic partons can generate fairly strong shock waves. However, significant anisotropic properties of the system due to the rapid longitudinal expansion of matter have not been taken into account in such studies. Moreover, the process of isotropization and its characteristic time-scales were not considered along with the question of the shock waves formation. Previous studies on shock discontinuous solutions in anisotropic hydrodynamics assumed constant anisotropy, leading to flow refraction towards the anisotropy axis and flow acceleration, characteristics of rarefaction waves, indicating limitations in this approach. This paper investigates discontinuous solutions for normal shock waves without flow refraction, introducing two compression parameters for longitudinal and transverse pressures. The resulting analytical solutions, as well as numerical computations, provide an isotropization mechanism of the system.</description>

      <title>The Connection between the Stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger Equation and Boltzmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heavy quarks present in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) can act as a probe of relativistic heavy ion collisions as they retain the memory of their interaction history. In a previous study, a stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SSE) has been applied to describe the transport process of heavy quarks, where an external field with random phases is used to simulate the thermal medium. In this work, we study the connection between the SSE and the Boltzmann equation (BE) approach in the Keldysh Green's function formalism. By comparing the Green's function of the heavy quark from the SSE and the Keldysh Green's functions leading to the Boltzmann equation, we demonstrate that the SSE is consistent with the Boltzmann equation in the weak coupling limit. We subsequently confirm their consistency through numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the polarization of boosted, hadronic $W$ bosons with jet substructure observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new technique to measure the longitudinal and transverse polarization fractions of hadronic decays of boosted $W$ bosons. We introduce a new jet substructure observable denoted as $p_\theta$, which is a proxy constructed purely out of subjet energies for the parton level decay polar angle of the $W$ boson in its rest-frame. The distribution of this observable is sensitive to the polarization of $W$ bosons and can therefore be used to reconstruct the $W$ polarization in a model-independent way. We argue that this proxy variable has lower reconstruction errors as compared to the other proxies that have been used by the experimental collaborations, especially for large boosts of the $W$-boson. As a test case, we study the efficacy of our technique on vector boson scattering (VBS) processes at the high luminosity Large Hadron Collider. With 10 ab$^{-1}$ of data, our technique can measure the transverse $W$ boson polarization fraction to within a 20% error. However, we expect that the experiments will not be able to detect the presence of a longitudinal polarization fraction at even the 2-$\sigma$ level, assuming a rate consistent with the Standard Model prediction. However, if the longitudinal $W$ boson polarization in VBS is enhanced in a beyond Standard Model scenario, then this technique may be useful to detect such new physics and to study its effect on unitarity restoration.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the SU(3) limit, we consider the nature of the dynamically generated resonances $\Lambda(1380)$, $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1680)$ as the pion and kaon masses are tuned to their physical values. We show that the accidental symmetry of the two octets due to the leading order Weinberg-Tomozawa term is broken by the next-to-leading order terms. Most interestingly, we observe an interchange of the two trajectories of the $\Lambda(1380)$ and the $\Lambda(1405)$ away from the SU(3) limit at next-to-leading order. This remarkable phenomenon can be investigated using lattice QCD calculations that start from the SU(3) limit.</description>

      <title>Probing the CP Structure of the Top Quark Yukawa at the Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the top-Higgs coupling with a CP violating phase $\xi$ at a future multi-TeV muon collider. We focus on processes that are directly sensitive to the top quark Yukawa coupling: $t\bar{t}h$, $tbh\mu\nu$, and $t\bar{t}h\nu\bar{\nu}$ with $h\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and semileptonic top decays. At different energies, different processes dominate the cross section, providing complementary information. At and above an energy of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV, vector boson fusion processes dominate. As we show, in the Standard Model there is destructive interference in the vector boson fusion processes $t\bar{t}h\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $tbh\mu\nu$ between the top quark Yukawa and Higgs-gauge boson couplings. A CP-violating phase changes this interference, and the cross section measurement is very sensitive to the size of the CP-violating angle. Although we find that the cross sections are measured to $\mathcal{O}(50\%)$ statistical uncertainty at $1\sigma$, a 10 and 30 TeV muon collider can bound the CP-violating angle $|\xi|\lesssim9.0^\circ$ and $|\xi|\lesssim5.4^\circ$, respectively. However, cross section measurements are insensitive to the sign of the CP-violating angle. To determine that the coupling is truly CP violating, observables sensitive to CP-violation must be measured. We find in the $t\bar{t}h$ process the azimuthal angle between the $t+\bar{t}$ plane and the initial state muon+Higgs plane shows good discrimination for $\xi=\pm0.1\pi$. For the $tbh\mu\nu$ and $t\bar{t}h\nu\bar{\nu}$ processes, the operator proportional to $\left(\vec{p}_\mu\times\vec{p}_h\right)\cdot \vec{p}_t$ is sensitive to the sign of CP phase $\xi$. From these observables, we construct asymmetry parameters that show good distinction between different values and signs of the CP violating angle.</description>

      <title>The 95 GeV Excess in the Georgi-Machacek Model: Single or Twin Peak Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility to address the excess observed around 95 GeV in the $\gamma\gamma$, $\tau\tau$, and $b\bar{b}$ channels as a scalar resonance(s) within the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model. In our analysis, we find that the excess can be easily accommodated in the channels ($\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}$) simultaneously, where the 95 GeV candidate is a single peak resonance (SPR) due to a light CP-even scalar. We found that the excess in the $\tau\tau$ channel can be addressed simultaneously with $\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}$ only if the 95 GeV candidate is a twin peak resonance (TPR), i.e., another CP-odd scalar in addition to the CP-even scalar. We demonstrate that the nature of the 95 GeV scalar resonance candidate (SPR or TPR) can be probed via the properties of its di-$\tau$ decay.</description>

      <title>Can femtoscopic correlation function shed light on the nature of the lightest, charm, axial mesons?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a coupled channel treatment of meson-meson dynamics, for systems with spin-parity $1^+$, and determine the corresponding amplitudes by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations, which lead to the generation of two axial resonances when mesons are considered as the degrees of freedom in the model. One of them is narrow and has properties in good agreement with those of $D_1(2420)$. The other pole is wider, but its real and imaginary parts do not match well with the mass and width of $D_1(2430)$. The situation improves when a bare quark-model state is included, indicating that the dynamics at the quark level as well as among hadrons can describe the two states simultaneously. Further, we discuss that there exists a divergence in the value of the $D^*\pi$ scattering length determined through data coming from lattice QCD calculations and from heavy ion collisions. Such different values can be accommodated in the model by making small changes in the parameters while producing two poles having properties compatible with the two lightest $D_1$ states. With these results, we proceed to calculate the correlation function for the $D^{*+(0)}\pi^{0(+)}$ system for different sizes of the source. We discuss which scenarios can be useful to shed some light on the issue.</description>

      <title>Generalized angular-order parton showers in Herwig 7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the inaugural investigation of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) radiation processes, framed as a generalized, process- and model-independent parton shower algorithm within Herwig 7, based on direct translations of Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) constructed via Herwig's ufo2herwig module. Leveraging the fact that shower kinematics are dictated by the spins of involved particles, we calculate comprehensive helicity-dependent branching kernels for all feasible splittings of scalars, fermions, and vector bosons, tailored to Herwig 7's angular-ordering (AO) parton shower algorithm. Utilizing these kernels, we derive BSM splitting functions in the quasi-collinear limit, ensuring compatibility with the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetry (SUSY) splitting functions when analogous parameter conditions are applied. These newly derived functions have been integrated into the Herwig 7 event generator framework. Comparative analyses with fixed-order matrix element calculations show good agreement for single radiation events. Moreover, the results showcase the influence of BSM radiation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and envisage its implications for future collider endeavours. This research augments our comprehension of BSM radiation effects, with significant bearings on present and prospective collider-based inquiries.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from new seesaw models: Low-scale variants and phenomenological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With just the Standard Model Higgs doublet, there are only three types of seesaw models that generate light Majorana neutrino masses at tree level after electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, if there exist additional TeV scalars acquiring vacuum expectation values, coupled with heavier fermionic multiplets, several new seesaw models become possible. These new seesaws are the primary focus of this study and correspond to the tree-level ultraviolet completions of the effective operators studied in a companion publication. We are interested in the genuine cases, in which the standard seesaw contributions are absent. In addition to the tree-level generation of neutrino masses, we also consider the one-loop contributions. Furthermore, we construct low-energy versions that exhibit a very rich phenomenology. Specifically, we scrutinise the generation of dimension-6 operators and explore their implications, including non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix, non-universal $Z-$boson interactions, and lepton flavor violation. Finally, we provide (Generalised) Scotogenic-like variants that incorporate viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of identified particles production in oxygen-oxygen collisions at \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}} = 7 TeV using EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aims to inject oxygen (${}^{16}O$) ions in the next run into its experiments. This include the anticipated one-day physics run focusing on $OO$ collisions at center-of-mass energy \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}} = 7 Tev. In this study, we have used recently developed version of the EPOS (EPOS4) to study the production of identified particles ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\overline{p})$) in $OO$ collisions at 7 Tev. Predictions of transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, $\langle p_T \rangle$, integrated yield (dN/dy) for different centrality classes are studied. To provide insight into the collective nature of the produced particles, we look into the $p_T$-differential particle ratios ($K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$) and $p_T$-integrated particle ratios to ($\pi^++\pi^-$) as a function of charge particle multiplicity. The shape of the charge particle multiplicity ($dN/d\eta$) and $\langle p_T \rangle$ is well described by the EPOS4. The EPOS4 predictions for the ratios of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ exhibit a systematic overestimation compared to the observed trends as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. Interestingly, the $OO$ results of $p_T$-integrated particle ratios shows a clear final state multiplicity overlap with $pp$, $p-Pb$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions. EPOS4 mimics signs of collectivity and is one of the suitable candidates to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the foreseen data from $OO$ collisions at the LHC, when available, will help to better understand the heavy-ion-like behavior in small systems as well as help to put possible constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Electrical Conductivity Tensor for Rotating Hadron Resonance Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the influence of the Coriolis force on the electrical conductivity of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nuclear collisions, employing the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. A rotating matter in the peripheral heavy ion collisions can be expected from the initial stage of quark matter to late-stage hadronic matter. Present work is focused on rotating hadronic matter, whose medium constituents - hadron resonances can face a non-zero Coriolis force, which can influence the hadronic flow or conductivity. We estimate this conductivity tensor by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation. In the absence of Coriolis force, an isotropic conductivity tensor for hadronic matter is expected. However, our study finds that the presence of Coriolis force can generate an anisotropic conductivity tensor with three main conductivity components - parallel, perpendicular, and Hall, similar to the effect of Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field. Our study has indicated that a noticeable anisotropy of conductivity tensor can be found within the phenomenological range of angular velocity $\Omega= 0.001-0.02$ GeV and hadronic scattering radius $a=0.2-2$ fm.</description>

      <title>Predicting isovector charmonium-like states from X(3872) properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using chiral effective field theory, we predict that there must be isovector charmonium-like $D\bar D^*$ hadronic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ denoted as $W_{c1}$. The inputs are the properties of the $X(3872)$, including its mass and the ratio of its branching fractions of decays into $J/\psi\rho^0$ and $J/\psi\omega$. The predicted states are virtual state poles of the scattering matrix, pointing at a molecular nature of the $X(3872)$ as well as its spin partners. They should show up as either a mild cusp or dip at the $D\bar D^*$ thresholds, explaining why they are elusive in experiments. The so far negative observation also indicates that the $X(3872)$ is either a bound state with non-vanishing binding energy or a virtual state, only in these cases the $X(3872)$ signal dominates over that from the $W_{c1}^0$. The pole positions are $3881.2^{+0.8}_{-0.0}- i 1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ MeV for $W_{c1}^0$ on the fourth Riemann sheet of the $D^0\bar D^{*0}$-$D^+D^{*-}$ coupled-channel system, and $3866.9^{+4.6}_{-7.7}- i (0.07\pm0.01)$ MeV for $W_{c1}^\pm$ on the second Riemann sheet of the $(D\bar D^*)^\pm$ single-channel system. The findings imply that the peak in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution is not purely from the $X(3872)$ but contains contributions from $W_{c1}^0$ predicted here. The states should have isovector heavy quark spin partners with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$, with the last one corresponding to $Z_c$. We suggest to search for the charged $0^{++}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ states in $J/\psi\pi^\pm \pi^0$.</description>

Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in flavored scalar scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints from synchrotron emission on very massive decaying dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the cosmological dark matter (DM) couples to Standard Model (SM) fields, it can decay promptly to SM states in a highly energetic hard process, which subsequently showers and hadronizes to give stable particles including $e^\pm$, $\gamma$, $p^{\pm}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}$ at lower energy. If the DM particle is very heavy, the high-energy $e^\pm$, due to the Klein-Nishina cross section suppression, preferentially lose energy via synchrotron emission which, in turn, can be of unusually high energies. Here, we present previously unexplored bounds on heavy decaying DM up to the Planck scale, by studying the synchrotron emission from the $e^\pm$ produced in the ambient Galactic magnetic field. In particular, we explore the sensitivity of the resulting constraints on the DM decay width to (i) different SM decay channels, to (ii) the Galactic magnetic field configurations, and (iii) to various different DM density profiles proposed in the literature. We find that constraints from the synchrotron component complement and improve on constraints from very high-energy cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observatories targeting the prompt emission when the DM is sufficiently massive, most significantly for masses in excess of $10^{12}\text{ GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative study of the electroweak phase transition in the real scalar singlet extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative lattice study of the electroweak phase transition in the real singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model.We consider both the heavy and light singlet-like scalar regimes at non-zero singlet-doublet mixing angle. After reviewing features of the lattice method relevant for phase transition studies, we analyze the dependence of phase transition thermodynamics on phenomenologically relevant parameters. In the heavy singlet-like scalar regime, we find that the transition is crossover for small doublet-singlet mixing angles, despite the presence of an energy barrier in the tree-level potential. The transition becomes first order for sufficiently large mixing angles. We find two-loop perturbation theory to agree closely with the lattice results for all thermodynamical quantities considered here (critical temperature, order parameter discontinuity, latent heat) when the transition is strongly first order. For the light singlet-like scalar regime relevant to exotic Higgs decays, we update previous one-loop perturbative results using the two-loop loop dimensionally reduced effective field theory and assess the nature of the transition with lattice simulations at set of benchmark parameter points. For fixed singlet-like scalar mass the transition becomes crossover when the magnitude of the Higgs-singlet portal coupling is small. We perform our simulations in the high-temperature effective theory, which we briefly review, and present analytic expressions for the relevant lattice-continuum relations.</description>

      <title>Muon g-2, Long-Range Muon Spin Force, and Neutrino Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have proposed using a geocentric muon spin force to account for the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, with the long-range force mediator being a light axion-like particle. The mediator exhibits a CP-violating scalar coupling to nucleons and a normal derivative coupling to muons. Due to the weak symmetry, this axion inevitably couples to neutrinos, providing potential impact on neutrino oscillations. By utilizing neutrino data from BOREXINO, IceCube DeepCore, Super-Kamiokande, and SNO, we have identified that both atmospheric and solar neutrino data can impose stringent constraints on the long-range muon spin force model and the $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space. With optimized data analysis techniques and the potential from future experiments, such as JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande, SNO+, and IceCube PINGU, there exists a promising opportunity to achieve even greater sensitivities. Indeed, neutrino oscillations offer a robust and distinctive cross-check for the model, offering stringent constraints on the $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>VAIM-CFF: A variational autoencoder inverse mapper solution to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual exclusive reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new methodology for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) in from deeply virtual exclusive reactions such as the unpolarized DVCS cross section using a specialized inverse problem solver, a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). The VAIM-CFF framework not only allows us access to a fitted solution set possibly containing multiple solutions in the extraction of all 8 CFFs from a single cross section measurement, but also accesses the lost information contained in the forward mapping from CFFs to cross section. We investigate various assumptions and their effects on the predicted CFFs such as cross section organization, number of extracted CFFs, use of uncertainty quantification technique, and inclusion of prior physics information. We then use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis to visualize the missing physics information tracked in the latent space of the VAIM framework. Through re-framing the extraction of CFFs as an inverse problem, we gain access to fundamental properties of the problem not comprehensible in standard fitting methodologies: exploring the limits of the information encoded in deeply virtual exclusive experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a relativistic Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly rotating relativistic Bose gas. First, we derive the solution of the equation of motion corresponding to a rotating complex Klein-Gordon field and determine the free propagator of this model utilizing the Fock-Schwinger proper-time method. Using this propagator, we then obtain the thermodynamic potential of this model in the zeroth and first perturbative level. In addition, we compute the nonperturbative ring contribution to this potential. Our focus is on the dependence of these expressions on the angular velocity, which effectively acts as a chemical potential. Using this thermodynamic potential, we calculate several quantities, including the pressure, angular momentum and entropy densities, heat capacity, speed of sound, and moment of inertia of this rigidly rotating Bose gas as functions of temperature ($T$), angular velocity ($\Omega$), and the coupling constant ($\alpha$). We show that certain thermodynamic instabilities appear at high temperatures and large couplings. They are manifested as zero and negative values of the above quantities, particularly the moment of inertia and heat capacity. Zero moment of inertia leads to the phenomenon of supervorticity at certain $T$ or $\alpha$. Supervortical temperatures (couplings) decrease with increasing coupling (temperature). We also observe superluminal sound velocities at high $T$ and for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Locating Quark-Antiquark String Breaking in QCD through Chiral Symmetry Restoration and Hawking-Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between QCD and the string model offers a valuable perspective for exploring the interaction potential between quarks. In this study, we investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry in connection with the Unruh effect experienced by accelerating observers. Utilizing the Schwinger model, we analyze the critical point at which the string or chromoelectric flux tube between quark-antiquarks breaks with increasing separation between quarks. In this study, the critical distance for quark-antiquark chromoelectric flux tube or string breaking is determined to be $r_c=1.294\pm0.040$ fm. The acceleration and Unruh temperature corresponding to this critical point signify the transition of the system's chiral symmetry from a broken to a restored state. Our estimates for the critical acceleration ($a_c=1.14\times 10^{34}$ cm/s$^{2}$) and Unruh temperature ($T_c=0.038$ GeV) align with previous studies. This analysis illuminates the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration, the Unruh effect, and the breaking of the string or chromoelectric flux tube within the context of quark interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the azimuthal asymmetries such as $\cos2{\phi_T}$ and Sivers symmetry for $J/\psi$ and $\pi^\pm$ production in electron-proton scattering, focusing on scenarios where the $J/\psi$ and the pion are produced in an almost back-to-back configuration. The electron is unpolarized, while the proton can be unpolarized or transversely polarized. For the $J/\psi$ formation, we use non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), while $\pi^\pm$ is formed due to parton fragmentation. In this kinematics, we utilize the transverse momentum-dependent factorization framework to calculate the cross sections and asymmetries. We consider both quark and gluon-initiated processes and show that the gluon contribution dominates. We provide numerical estimates of the upper bounds on the azimuthal asymmetries, as well as employ a Gaussian parametrization for the gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs), within the kinematical region accessible by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

Abstract: We discuss the appearance of topological structures from the spontaneous breaking of $E_6$ to the Standard Model via its maximal subgroup $SO(10) \times U(1)_\psi$. They include dumbbells, metastable strings, as well as domain walls bounded by necklaces. We provide a novel scenario for producing metastable strings based on the symmetry breaking $U(1)_\psi \longrightarrow Z_8 \longrightarrow Z_4$. The metastable string arises from the merger of $Z_8$ strings that bound a domain wall. An unbroken gauge $Z_2$ symmetry from $SO(10)$ breaking yields viable stable dark matter candidates as well as topologically stable strings. We discuss the gravitational wave emission from two varieties of cosmic strings, namely the superheavy metastable ones and the intermediate scale topologically stable cosmic strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A confining extension of the quark model with nonlocal currents is proposed. The quark propagator is modified by introducing a cut in {\alpha}-space, which in momentum space corresponds to the subtraction of pole singularities. A two-phase phase structure is proposed for modeling the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confined phase, the quark propagator does not have any pole singularities, while in the deconfined phase, there is a single quark pole.</description>

Abstract: Despite the discovery of the Higgs boson, the Higgs sector of the standard model is still not fully established. In particular, the self couplings of the Higgs boson, and its couplings with gauge bosons, are still to be fully determined. We consider electroweak corrections to the process $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu}_e\nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu$. The corrections depend on the $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We investigate this dependence in $\kappa$-framework. We find that the width depends on $HHH$ coupling significantly. The dependence on $ZZHH$ coupling is only marginal. We also discuss the dependence on $ZZWW$ coupling.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs boson and spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported a diphoton excess in the invariant mass distribution around the 95.4 GeV with a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Moreover, there is another $2.3\sigma$ local excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state at LEP in the same mass region. A plausible solution is that the Higgs sector is extended to include an additional Higgs boson with a mass of $95.4$ GeV. We study a complex singlet scalar extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model in which the 95.4 GeV Higgs is from the mixing of three CP-even Higgs fields. In addition, the extended Higgs potential can achieve spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature and restore CP symmetry at the present temperature of the Universe. We find that the model can simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses around the 95.4 GeV while satisfying various relevant constraints including the experiments of collider and electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Deepest Sensitivity to Wavelike Dark Photon Dark Matter with SRF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavelike, bosonic dark matter candidates like axions and dark photons can be detected using microwave cavities known as haloscopes. Traditionally, haloscopes consist of tunable copper cavities operating in the TM$_{010}$ mode, but ohmic losses have limited their performance. In contrast, superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities can achieve quality factors of $\sim 10^{10}$, perhaps five orders of magnitude better than copper cavities, leading to more sensitive dark matter detectors. In this paper, we first derive that the scan rate of a haloscope experiment is proportional to the loaded quality factor $Q_L$, even if the cavity bandwidth is much narrower than the dark matter halo line shape. We then present a proof-of-concept search for dark photon dark matter using a nontunable ultrahigh quality SRF cavity. We exclude dark photon dark matter with kinetic mixing strengths of $\chi &gt; 1.5\times 10^{-16}$ for a dark photon mass of $m_{A^{\prime}} = 5.35\mu$eV, achieving the deepest exclusion to wavelike dark photons by almost an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Prediction of non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the lightest neutrino mass revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the constraint of the non-SUSY AdS conjecture on the three-dimensional vacua obtained from the compactification of the Standard Model coupled to Einstein gravity on a circle where the three-dimensional components of the four-dimensional metric are general functions of both non-compact and compact coordinates. From studying the wavefunction profile of the three-dimensional metric in the compactified dimension, we find that the radius of the compactified dimension must be quantized. Consequently, the three-dimensional vacua are constrained by not only the non-SUSY AdS conjecture but also the quantization rule of the circle radius, leading to both upper and lower bounds for the mass of the lightest neutrino as $\sqrt{2}\leq m_\nu/\sqrt{\Lambda_4}&lt;\sqrt{3}$ where $\Lambda_4\simeq5.06\times10^{-84}$ GeV$^2$ is the observed cosmological constant. This means that the lightest neutrino should have a mass around $10^{-32}$ eV or it would be approximately massless. With this prediction, we reconstruct the light neutrino mass matrix that is fixed by the neutrino oscillation data and in terms of three new mixing angles and six new phases for both the normal ordering and inverted ordering. In the situation that the light neutrino mass matrix is Hermitian, we calculate its numerical value in the $3\sigma$ range.</description>

      <title>Refine Neutrino Events Reconstruction with BEiT-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification, trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric, overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ChenLi2049/ISeeCube</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the non-supersymmetric AdS instability conjecture can point to how quantum gravity removes the initial Big Bang singularity, leading to a potential resolution for the past-incomplete inflationary universe. From the constraints on the dynamics of the universe realized as the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble mediating the decay of the non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum, we find the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical scale factor $a_c$ for which the universe exists. These critical quantities are all finite and determined in terms of the parameters specifying the stringy 10D AdS vacuum solutions. Additionally, we derive the prediction of quantum gravity for $T_c$ and $a_c$ relying on the inflationary observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic $S-$wave scattering of a charm meson with a light pseudoscalar meson in $J^P =0^+$ is investigated in the flavour $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$, $\mathbf{6}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{15}}$ sectors at the $SU(3)_f$ flavour point using lattice QCD, working on three volumes with $m_{\pi} \approx 700$ MeV. Large bases of interpolating operators are employed to extract finite-volume spectra, which are subsequently used with the L\"uscher method to provide constraints on infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. Examining the singularities of the amplitudes, the $S-$wave amplitude in the flavour $\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ sector is found to contain a deeply bound state, strongly coupled to elastic threshold, corresponding to the $J^P = 0^+$ $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. In the exotic flavour $\mathbf{6}$ sector a virtual bound state is found at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{pole}}} = 2510 - 2610$ MeV, roughly $40-140$ MeV below threshold, whereas the $\overline{\mathbf{15}}$ channel shows weak repulsion.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have applied thermodynamic stability analysis to derive the stability and causality conditions for conventional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and spin hydrodynamics. We obtain the thermodynamic stability conditions for second-order relativistic hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscous tensors, finding them identical to those derived from linear mode analysis. We then derive the thermodynamic stability conditions for minimal causal extended second-order spin hydrodynamics in canonical form, both with and without viscous tensors. Without viscous tensors, the constraints from thermodynamic stability exactly match those from linear mode analysis. In the presence of viscous tensors, the thermodynamic stability imposes more stringent constraints than those obtained from linear mode analysis. Our results suggest that conditions derived from thermodynamic stability analysis can guarantee both causality and stability in linear mode analysis.</description>

      <title>Unearthing the intersections: positivity bounds, weak gravity conjecture, and asymptotic safety landscapes from photon-graviton flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also provide some hints on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>
