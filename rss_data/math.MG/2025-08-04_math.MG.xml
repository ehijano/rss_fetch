      <title>Doubling property of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Yang, Yuan and Zhang [Doubling properties of self-similar measures and Bernoulli measures on self-affine Sierpinski sponges, Indiana Univ. Math. J., 73 (2024), 475-492] characterized when a self-similar measure satisfying the open set condition is doubling. In this paper, we study when  a self-similar measure with overlaps is doubling. Let $m\geq 2$ and let  $\beta&gt;1$ be the Pisot number satisfying $\beta^m=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\beta^j$. Let  $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2)$ be a probability weight and let $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ be the self-similar measure associated to the IFS $\{ S_1(x)={x}/{\beta}, S_2(x)={x}/{\beta}+(1-{1}/{\beta}),\}.$ Yung [...,Indiana Univ. Math. J., ] proved that when $m=2$, $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ is doubling if and only if $\mathbf{p}=(1/2,1/2)$. We show that for $m\geq 3$, $\mu_{\mathbf{p}}$ is always non-doubling.</description>

      <title>Algebraic connectivity in normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic connectivity of a graph $G$ in a finite dimensional real normed linear space $X$ is a geometric counterpart to the Fiedler number of the graph and can be regarded as a measure of the rigidity of the graph in $X$. We analyse the behaviour of the algebraic connectivity of $G$ in $X$ with respect to graph decomposition, vertex deletion and isometric isomorphism, and provide a general bound expressed in terms of the geometry of $X$ and the Fiedler number of the graph. Particular focus is given to the space $\ell_\infty^d$ where we present explicit formulae and calculations as well as upper and lower bounds. As a key tool, we show that the monochrome subgraphs of a complete framework in $\ell_\infty^d$ are odd-hole-free. Connections to redundant rigidity are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the Undecidability of Tiling the $3$-dimensional Space with a Set of $3$ Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translational tiling problems are among the most fundamental and representative undecidable problems in all fields of mathematics. Greenfeld and Tao obtained two remarkable results on the undecidability of translational tiling in recent years. One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a space of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of translational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided that the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support the following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that translational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards solving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling of a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$ as small as possible. In this paper, it is shown that translational tiling the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $3$ polycubes is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Graphs with tree decompositions of small graphs and realizing them as the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have been interested in graphs and realizing them as Reeb graphs of explicit real algebraic functions.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the quotient space of the manifold of the domain, regarded as the space consisting of all components of preimages of all single points. Reeb graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry of manifolds since the birth of theory of Morse functions, in the former half of the 20th century. We can easily see that the Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere whose dimension is at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and two edges.
  We are concerned with realizations of graphs decomposed into trees nicely, each vertex of which corresponds to a graph with exactly one edge and two edges or a graph with exactly two edges homeomorphic to a circle.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants of locally compact groups: the homological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the homological version of $\Sigma$-theory for locally compact Hausdorff groups, leaving the homotopical version for another paper. Both versions are connected by a Hurewicz-like theorem. They can be thought of as directional versions of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and type $\mathrm{C}_m$, respectively. And classical $\Sigma$-theory is recovered if we equip an abstract group with the discrete topology. This paper provides criteria for type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and homological locally compact $\Sigma^m$. Given a short exact sequence with kernel of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$, we can derive $\Sigma^m$ of the extension on the sphere that vanishes on the kernel from the quotient and likewise. Given a short exact sequence with abelian quotient, $\Sigma$-theory on the extension can tell if the kernel is of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$.</description>

      <title>The metric compactification of a Kobayashi hyperbolic complex manifold and a Denjoy--Wolff Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the metric compactification of a Kobayashi hyperbolic complex manifold \(\mathcal{X} \) equipped with the Kobayashi distance \( \mathsf{k}_{\mathcal{X}} \). We show that this compactification is genuine -- i.e., \( \mathcal{X} \) embeds as a dense open subset -- even without completeness of \( \mathsf{k}_{\mathcal{X}} \), and that it becomes a \emph{good compactification} in the sense of Bharali--Zimmer when \((\mathcal{X}, \mathsf{k}_{\mathcal{X}}) \) is complete. As an application, we obtain a criterion for the continuous extension of quasi-isometric embeddings from \( (\mathcal{X}, \mathsf{k}_{\mathcal{X}}) \) into visibility domains of complex manifolds. For a Kobayashi hyperbolic domain \( \Omega \subsetneq \mathcal{X} \), to each boundary point of \( \Omega \) in the end compactification, we associate a fiber of metric boundary points. This allows the small and big horospheres of Abate to be expressed as the intersection and union of horoballs centered at metric boundary points. We use this to formulate a Wolff-type lemma in terms of horoballs and prove a Denjoy--Wolff theorem for complete hyperbolic domains satisfying a boundary divergence condition for \(\mathsf{k}_{\mathcal{X}} \). Finally, we present necessary and sufficient conditions under which the identity map extends continuously between the metric and end compactifications.</description>
