      <title>Persistence and Topological Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological complexity is a homotopy invariant that measures the minimal number of continuous rules required for motion planning in a space. In this work, we introduce persistent analogs of topological complexity and its cohomological lower bound, the zero-divisor-cup-length, for persistent topological spaces, and establish their stability. For Vietoris-Rips filtrations of compact metric spaces, we show that the erosion distances between these persistent invariants are bounded above by twice the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We also present examples illustrating that persistent topological complexity and persistent zero-divisor-cup-length can distinguish between certain spaces more effectively than persistent homology.</description>

      <title>$C_{pq}$-Injective Diagrams and a Combination Theorem for Minimal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diagrams of commutative differential graded algebras (DGAs) over the orbit category $\sO_G$ in the context of equivariant rational homotopy theory. For $G = C_{pq}$ with $p, q$ distinct primes, we give necessary conditions for injectivity. We prove a combination-type result: the equivariant wedge of injective diagrams over $\mathcal{O}_{C_p}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{C_q}$ with retract structure maps yields an injective diagram over $\mathcal{O}_{C_{pq}}$ with a level-wise minimal model. As an application, we construct examples of $C_{pq}$-formal spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the rational representation-ring-graded stable stems for rank 1 groups, SU(2), SO(3), Pin (2), O(2), Spin(2) and
  SO(2), in the same spirit as the calculations for finite groups in arXiv:2205.02382 with J.D.Quigley. This illustrates the effectiveness
  of the algebraic models for these categories of G-spectra, and the way tom Dieck splitting fails for desuspensions.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [12] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [12].</description>

      <title>On Fico's Lemmata and the Homotopy Type of Certain Gyrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake to determine the homotopy type of gyrations of sphere products and of connected sums, thereby generalising results known in earlier literature as ''Fico's Lemmata'' which underpin gyrations in their original formulation from geometric topology. We provide applications arising from recasting these results into the modern homotopy theoretic setting.</description>

      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants allow one to obtain an arithmetically meaningful count of curves satisfying constraints over a field $k$ without assuming that $k$ is the field of complex or real numbers. This paper studies the behavior of quadratic genus $0$ Gromov--Witten invariants during an algebraic analogue of surgery on del Pezzo surfaces. For this, we define and study (twisted) binomial coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group, building on work of Serre. We obtain a formula expressing the quadratic genus $0$ Gromov--Witten invariants of surfaces obtained as a smoothing of a given nodal surface in terms of those of the one having the largest Picard group. We give applications to quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants of rational del Pezzo surfaces of degree at least 7, some cubic surfaces, for point constraints defined over quadratic extensions of $k$, as well as an invariance result under a Dehn twist.</description>

      <title>Projective length, phantom extensions, and the structure of flat modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the natural generalization of the notion of the order of a phantom map from the topological setting to triangulated categories. When applied to the derived category of the category of countable flat modules over a countable Dedekind domain, this yields a notion of\emph{\ phantom extension} of order $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We provide a complexity-theoretic characterization of the module $\mathrm{Ph}% ^{\alpha }\mathrm{Ext}\left( C,A\right) $ of phantom extensions of order $\alpha $ with respect to the structure of \emph{phantom Polish module} on $\mathrm{Ext}\left( C,A\right) $ obtained by considering it as an object of the left heart of the quasi-abelian category of Polish modules. We use this characterization to prove the following Dichotomy Theorem: either all the extensions of a countable flat module $A$ are trivial (which happens precisely when $A$ is divisible) or $A$ has phantom extensions of arbitrarily high order.
  By producing canonical phantom projective resolutions of order $\alpha $, we prove that phantom extensions of order $\alpha $ define on the category of countable flat modules an exact structure $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha }$ that is hereditary with enough projectives, and the functor $\mathrm{Ph}^{\alpha }% \mathrm{Ext}$ is the derived functor of $\mathrm{Hom}$ with respect to $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha }$. We prove a Structure Theorem characterizing the objects of the class $\mathcal{P}_{\alpha }$ of countable flat modules that have \emph{projective length at most }$\alpha $ (i.e., are $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha }$-projective) as the direct summands of colimits of presheaves of finite flat modules over well-founded forests of rank $% 1+\alpha $ regarded as ordered sets. This can be seen as the first analogue in the flat case of the classical Ulm Classification Theorem for torsion modules.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theory of curved operads and curved algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.03004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curved algebras are algebras endowed with a predifferential, which is an endomorphism of degree -1 whose square is not necessarily 0. This makes the usual definition of quasi-isomorphism meaningless and therefore the homotopical study of curved algebras cannot follow the same path as differential graded algebras.
  In this article, we propose to study curved algebras by means of curved operads. We develop the theory of bar and cobar constructions adapted to this new notion as well as Koszul duality theory. To be able to provide meaningful definitions, we work in the context of objects which are filtered and complete and become differential graded after applying the associated graded functor.
  This setting brings its own difficulties but it nevertheless permits us to define a combinatorial model category structure that we can transfer to the category of curved operads and to the category of algebras over a curved operad using free-forgetful adjunctions.
  We address the case of curved associative algebras. We recover the notion of curved Aoo-algebras, and we show that the homotopy categories of curved associative algebras and of curved Aoo-algebras are Quillen equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If G is a finite group, some aspects of the modular representation theory depend on the cochains C^*(BG; k), viewed as a commutative ring spectrum. We consider here its singularity category (in the sense of the author and Stevenson arxiv 1702.07957) and show that if C^*(BG; k) is a homotopical complete intersection in a strong sense, then the singularity category is the bounded derived category of the k-nullification of the connective ring spectrum C_*(\Omega BG_p). In the course of this we establish a form of Gorenstein duality for C_*(\Omega BG_p) for these groups.

      <title>Strong discrete Morse theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to develop a version of Forman's discrete Morse theory for simplicial complexes, based on internal strong collapses. Classical discrete Morse theory can be viewed as a generalization of Whitehead's collapses, where each Morse function on a simplicial complex $K$ defines a sequence of elementary internal collapses. This reduction guarantees the existence of a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to $K$, with cells corresponding to the critical simplices of the Morse function. However, this approach lacks an explicit combinatorial description of the attaching maps, which limits the reconstruction of the homotopy type of $K$. By restricting discrete Morse functions to those induced by total orders on the vertices, we develop a strong discrete Morse theory, generalizing the strong collapses introduced by Barmak and Minian. We show that, in this setting, the resulting reduced CW-complex is regular, enabling us to recover its homotopy type combinatorially. We also provide an algorithm to compute this reduction and apply it to obtain efficient structures for complexes in the library of triangulations by Benedetti and Lutz.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Persistence Modules are Generically Indecomposable</title>

Abstract: Algebraic persistence studies persistence modules (typically, linear representations of the poset $\mathbf{R}^n$ with $n \geq 1$) and the algebraic relationships between persistence modules that are interleaved. The notion of $\varepsilon$-interleaving between persistence modules is a generalization of the notion of isomorphism (recovering isomorphism when $\varepsilon = 0$), which can be used to quantify how far any two persistence modules are from being isomorphic. An emblematic example of this kind of study is the algebraic stability theorem, which strengthens the Krull--Schmidt property of one-parameter persistence modules (representations of $\mathbf{R}$) by generalizing isomorphism to interleaving: If a pair of one-parameter persistence modules is $\varepsilon$-interleaved, then there exists a partial matching between the indecomposable summands of the two modules such that matched indecomposables are $\varepsilon$-interleaved and unmatched indecomposables are $\varepsilon$-interleaved with the zero module. Our first main result implies that the obvious extension of the algebraic stability theorem to the case of multi-parameter persistence modules (representations of $\mathbf{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$) fails spectacularly: Any finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence module can be approximated arbitrarily well by an indecomposable module. Our second main result states that modules that are sufficiently close to an indecomposable decompose as a direct sum of an indecomposable and a nearly trivial module. We derive from these two results several consequences about the interplay between the algebraic and the topological properties of multi-parameter persistence modules. These results provide strong motivation for approaching multi-parameter persistence in a way that does not rely on directly decomposing modules by indecomposables.</description>

      <title>Computing Betti tables and minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Betti tables of a multigraded module encode the grades at which there is an algebraic change in the module. Multigraded modules show up in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, and in particular in topological data analysis, where they are known as persistence modules, and where their Betti tables describe the places at which the homology of filtered simplicial complexes changes. Although Betti tables of singly and bigraded modules are already being used in applications of topological data analysis, their computation in the bigraded case (which relies on an algorithm that is cubic in the size of the filtered simplicial complex) is a bottleneck when working with large datasets. We show that, in the special case of zero-dimensional homology (relevant for clustering and graph classification) Betti tables of bigraded modules can be computed in log-linear time. We also consider the problem of computing minimal presentations, and show that minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology can be computed in quadratic time, regardless of the grading poset.</description>

Abstract: We construct a lift of the degree filtration on the integer valued polynomials to (even MU-based) synthetic spectra. Namely, we construct a bialgebra in modules over the evenly filtered sphere spectrum which base-changes to the degree filtration on the integer valued polynomials. As a consequence, we may lift the Hilbert additive group scheme to a spectral group scheme over $\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{G}_m$. We study the cohomology of its deloopings, and show that one obtains a lift of the filtered circle, studied in [MRT22]. At the level of quasi-coherent sheaves, one obtains lifts synthetic lifts of the $\mathbb{Z}$-linear $\infty$-categories of $S^1_{\mathrm{fil}}$-representations. Our constructions crucially rely on the use of the even filtration of Hahn--Raksit--Wilson; it is linearity with respect to the even filtered sphere that powers the results of this work.</description>
