      <title>Modeling formation and transport of clusters at high temperature and pressure gradients by implying partial chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed. The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived. The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters in numerical process modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunnelling Across Hydrogen Bonds: Proton--Deuteron Isotope Effects from a Cornell-Type Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a double-well Schr\"odinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <title>Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding, ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.</description>

      <title>Edge Irregularity Strength: A Complementary Descriptor to Topological Indices in QSPR and QSAR Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chemical graph theory, topological indices are widely used as numerical descriptors for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These indices successfully correlate molecular structure with various physicochemical and biological properties. In addition to these methods, the concept of edge irregularity strength, a graph labeling measure, offers another perspective for representing structural characteristics. In this context, the edge irregularity strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength captures molecular features and complements existing approaches to structure-property analysis in chemical graph theory.</description>

      <title>Size-Consistent Adiabatic Connection Functionals via Orbital-Based Matrix Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a size-consistent and orbital-invariant formalism for constructing correlation functionals based on the adiabatic connection for density functional theory (DFT). By constructing correlation energy matrices for the weak and strong correlation limits in the space of occupied orbitals, our method, which we call orbital-based size-consistent matrix interpolation (OSMI), avoids previous difficulties in the construction of size-consistent adiabatic connection functionals. We design a simple, nonempirical adiabatic connection and a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional, and we show that the resulting method reproduces the correlation energy of the uniform electron gas over a wide range of densities. When applied to subsets of the GMTKN55 thermochemistry database, OSMI is more accurate on average than MP2 and nonempirical density functionals. Most notably, OSMI provides excellent predictions of the barrier heights we tested, with average errors of less than 2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. Finally, we find that OSMI improves the trade-off between fractional spin and fractional charge errors for bond dissociation curves compared to DFT and MP2. The fact that OSMI provides a good description of molecular systems and the uniform electron gas, while also maintaining low self-interaction error and size-consistency, suggests that it could provide a framework for studying heterogeneous chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic perturbation theory of the exact factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF) framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.</description>

      <title>Signal attenuation and phase evolution evaluation under the influence of nonlinear gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately analyzing NMR and MRI diffusion experimental data relies on the theoretical expression used for signal attenuation or phase evolution. In a complex system, the encountered magnetic field is often inhomogeneous, which may be represented by a linear combination of z^n gradient fields, where n is the order. Additionally, the higher the order of the nonlinear gradient field, the more sensitive the phase variances are to differences in diffusion coefficients and delay times. Hence, studying higher-order fields has both theoretical and experimental importance, but this is a challenge for traditional methods. The recently proposed phase diffusion method proposed a general way to overcome the challenge. This method is used and demonstrated in detail in this paper to determine the phase evolution in a quadric field (n = 4). Three different types of phase evolution in the quadric gradient field are obtained. Moreover, a general signal attenuation expression is proposed to describe the signal attenuation for spin diffusion from the origin of the nonlinear gradient field. This approximation is based on the short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation but is extended to include the finite gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect by using the mean square phase. Compared to other forms of signal attenuation, such as Gaussian and Lorentzian, this method covers a broader range of attenuation, from small to relatively large. Additionally, this attenuation is easier to understand than the Mittag-Leffler function-based attenuation. The results, particularly the phase and signal attenuation expressions obtained in this paper, potentially advance PFG diffusion research in nonlinear gradient fields in NMR and MRI.</description>

      <title>Vertical Excitation Energies of Embedded Systems: The Vertical Excitation Model (VEM) within Polarizable QM/MM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarizable Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) approaches based on fluctuating charges and dipoles (QM/FQ(F$\mu$)) are formulated within the state-specific Vertical Excitation Model (VEM) to compute vertical excitation energies of solvated systems. This methodology overcomes the limitations of the widely used Linear Response (LR) approach. While LR can capture the dynamic response of the solvent to the QM transition density, it neglects the solvent reorganization that follows solute relaxation upon electronic excitation. In contrast, the VEM framework explicitly accounts for this effect. Benchmark calculations of vertical excitation energies using QM/FQ(F$\mu$) are reported for a representative set of solutes - acrolein, acetone, caffeine, p-nitroaniline, coumarin 153, doxorubicin, and betaine-30 - comparing VEM with LR, corrected LR (cLR), and cLR 2 schemes. The results reveal notable variations in solvent response depending on the character of the electronic transition and demonstrate that optimal accuracy can be achieved by selecting the most appropriate model for each specific system and excitation.</description>

      <title>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Single-particle detection of a semiconductor-to-metal transition by scanning dielectric microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid nanostructures that combine semiconducting and metallic components offer great potential for photothermal therapy, optoelectronics, and sensing, by integrating tunable optical properties with enhanced light absorption and charge transport. Boosting the integrated performance of these hybrid systems demands techniques capable of probing local variations of the physical properties inaccessible to bulk analysis. Here, we report the single-particle dielectric characterization of hybrid, semiconducting bismuth sulfide (Bi$_2$S$_3$) nanorods (NR) decorated with metallic Au nanoparticles (NP), employing scanning dielectric microscopy, which uses electrostatic force microscopy in combination with finite-element numerical simulations. We reveal a pronounced enhancement in the local dielectric response of Bi$_2$S$_3$ upon Au decoration, attributed to interfacial polarization and electron transfer from Au to the Bi$_2$S$_3$ matrix, thus suggesting a semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at the single-particle level. Numerical simulations show that the response is dominated by the vertical component of the permittivity and that the decorating metallic Au NP produce only moderate shielding of the semiconductor Bi$_2$S$_3$ NR core, indicating that the large increase in the dielectric response originates primarily from intrinsic modifications within the NR. Overall, these findings provide direct insight into structure--property relationships at the single-particle level, supporting the rational design of advanced hybrid nanostructures with tailored electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Atom-centered electric multipole moments dynamically generated from QM/MM MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom-centered electric multipole moments can be extremely useful in chemistry as they enable the systematic mapping of a complex electrostatic problem to a simpler model. However, since they do not correspond to physical observables, there is no unique way to define them. In this work, we present an extension of the dynamically generated RESP charges (D-RESP) method, referred to as xDRESP, where atom-centered multipoles are computed from mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the ability of xDRESP charges to reproduce the electrostatic potential, as well as molecular multipoles, against the performance of fixed point-charge models commonly used in force fields. Moreover, we highlight cases where DRESP atomic multipoles can provide valuable information about chemical systems, such as indicating when polarization plays a significant role, and chemical reactions, in which xDRESP atomic multipoles can be used as an on-the-fly analysis tool to track changes in electron density.</description>

      <title>Atomistic QM/Classical Modeling of Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale quantum mechanics/classical (QM/MM) approach for modeling surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectra of molecules adsorbed on plasmonic nanostructures. The molecular subsystem is described at the density functional theory (DFT) level, while the plasmonic material is represented using fully atomistic, frequency-dependent Fluctuating Charges ($\omega$FQ) and Fluctuating Charges and Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models. These schemes enable an accurate and computationally efficient description of the plasmonic response of both graphene-based materials and noble metal nanostructures, achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. The proposed methodology is applied to the calculation of SEIRA spectra of adenine adsorbed on gold nanoparticles and graphene sheets. The quality and robustness of the approach are assessed through comparison with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra and available experimental data. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a reliable route to simulate vibrational responses of plasmon-molecule hybrid systems.</description>

Abstract: Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution.</description>

      <title>COFAP: A Universal Framework for COFs Adsorption Prediction through Designed Multi-Modal Extraction and Cross-Modal Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features. However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly deployable in crystalline porous materials.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic corrections to electric quadrupole transition rates in H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive formulas and perform calculations of nonadiabatic corrections to rates of electric quadrupole transitions in the hydrogen molecule. These corrections can be represented in terms of the quadrupole moment curve $D^{(1)}(R)$, similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer one, $D^{(0)}(R)$, derived originally by Wolniewicz. Numerical results change E2 transition rates for the fundamental band by as much as 0.4 - 12\% depending on rotational quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>A charge-density machine-learning workflow for computing the infrared spectrum of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as Faradaic reactions at electrochemical interfaces, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</description>

      <title>Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions have proven effective for sampling biomolecules. Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker--Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker--Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling. Our code, model weights, and self-contained JAX and PyTorch notebooks are available at https://github.com/noegroup/ScoreMD.</description>

      <title>Thermal History Asymmetry and Dissipation in Dense Colloidal Microgel Glasses</title>

Abstract: Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the target temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events. The heights of the peaks were found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.</description>

      <title>Tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>
