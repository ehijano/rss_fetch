      <title>Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that develop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure, appearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear disconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected surface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first time, these secondary loops are identified as "connected" or "disconnected" with respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of centre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low temperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the same sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small secondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above the phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a single large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With the near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension, connected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes themselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring near critical lattice gauge simulators with Rydberg atoms facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.</description>

      <title>Thermal modifications of mesons and energy-energy correlators from real-time simulations of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Probing $ \phi $N interaction through bound states of $_{\phi}^{6}\textrm{He} $ mesic nuclei within $ \phi\textrm{N-}\alpha $ cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin dependence of the $ \phi $N interaction is explored through the bound states of
  $ \phi\textrm{N-}\alpha $ mesic nuclei with $\alpha$ being a spectator to attract the $ \phi $N pair without changing its spin structure.
  The bound state of $ _{\phi}^{6}\textrm{He} $ mesic nuclei is calculated within the framework of the developed three-body cluster model 
  by solving the Faddeev equations in the method of hyperspherical harmonics (HH) expansions.
  The calculations are done by employing the state-of-the-art $ \phi $N potential obtained from lattice QCD calculations and correlation function analysis for the $^{4}S_{3/2}$ and $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channels.
  The $ \phi\alpha $ potential is constructed through a folding procedure of the spin-averaged $ \phi $N interaction with
  the matter distribution of $ ^{4}\textrm{He} $.
  And for N$\alpha$ potential two common types of N$\alpha$ interactions are taken from the literature with central and spin-orbit
  components.
  The central binding energies of the $ \phi\textrm{N-}\alpha $ bound states in the spin $ 3/2\left(1/2\right) $ channel are found to be $\sim 10 \left(25\right) $ and $ 11 \left(13\right) $ MeV at Euclidean times $ t/a=12 $ and $14$, respectively. As well as, the corresponding nuclear matter radii are estimated to be $\sim 4.5 \left(1.7\right) $ and $ 4.6 \left(1.8\right) $ fm.</description>

      <title>Nucleon scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from lattice QCD on baryon resonances and meson-baryon, baryon-baryon scattering are presented. Such scattering processes and resonances can be determined in lattice QCD by first obtaining the finite-volume energy spectrum of stationary states involving meson-baryon and baryon-baryon systems. A well-known quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those which produce a finite-volume spectrum which best matches that obtained from lattice QCD. The $\Delta$ resonance, a recent study of the two-pole nature of scattering near the $\Lambda(1405)$, and $NN$ scattering in the $SU(3)$ flavor limit are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquarks from lattice QCD: incorporating diquark-antidiquark operators and the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice studies of the doubly-charm tetraquark $T_{cc}=cc\bar u\bar d$ require the determination of the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude, which most often incorporate only meson-meson interpolators. We additionally incorporate diquark-antidiquark operators and find that these have some impact on certain eigenenergies. This study presents the first extraction of the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude based on the meson-meson as well as diquark antidiquark interpolators. The effect of the additional operators renders
  slightly smaller values of $p\cot \delta_0$ and a $T_{cc}$ pole slightly closer to the threshold. The scattering amplitude is extracted from eigenenergies by adopting plane-wave and effective-field-theoretic methods, which also incorporate the left-hand cut and address the partial wave mixing. The $T_{cc}$ is found to be a subthreshold resonance with a pole at $m_{T_{cc}}-m_D-m_{D^*}=-5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8} - i \cdot 6.3^{+2.4}_{-4.8}~$MeV, employing CLS ensembles with $m_\pi\simeq 280~$MeV and the distillation method. A more significant effect of diquark-antidiquark operators on eigen-energies is found for larger heavy quark masses relevant for $T_{bb}$. We find that deeply bound $T_{bb}$ does not emerge when employing only meson-meson operators, where each meson is separately momentum projected, while the deeply bound state emerges after adding local diquark antidiquark operators.</description>
