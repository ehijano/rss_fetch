      <title>Reference Quadrupole Moments of Transition Elements from Lamb Shifts in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for accurately measuring the absolute electric quadrupole moments of light transition elements $(23 \leq Z \leq 30 )$. Our approach is based on performing precision muonic x-ray spectroscopy of the $2s-2p$ manifold, which is also referred to as the Lamb shift. These transitions are too weak to be detected with dispersive methods and too overlapping to be resolved by solid-state detectors. Here, we propose the use of cryogenic microcalorimeters, which possess high efficiency and excellent energy resolution in the relevant energy regime, coupled with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement. These precise reference quadrupole moments serve as valuable inputs for nuclear structure studies and for benchmarking state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations in open-shell elements.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced azimuthal anisotropy in coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropies in heavy-ion collisions are conventionally interpreted as signatures of hydrodynamic flow. We demonstrate that in peripheral collisions, a significant $\cos 2\phi$ asymmetry in the decay leptons of coherently photoproduced $J/\psi$ mesons arises purely from the initial-state geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. This modulation originates from the linear polarization of coherent photons, which is radially aligned in impact parameter space and transferred to the vector meson. By employing light-cone perturbation theory within the dipole formalism, we calculate the centrality dependence of this asymmetry for collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Our predictions quantitatively reproduce STAR data. This observable thus provides a rigorous benchmark for distinguishing electromagnetic initial-state effects from collective medium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-pion exchange contributions to the relativistic chiral nuclear force at N$^3$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the two-pion exchange contributions to the nucleon-nucleon interaction up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. Both one-loop and two-loop diagrams are calculated with the spectral functional regularization. We show that the phase shifts for partial waves with total angular momentum $3\le J\le 5$ are in better agreement with the partial wave analysis from the Nijmegen or the SAID group than their N$^2$LO counterparts. In addition, the relativistic chiral force exhibits better convergence than its non-relativistic counterpart, suggesting the importance of relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Isotonic Odd-Even Staggering of Charge Radii in Deformed Rare Earth Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is a Fierz interference term $b$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactions can produce many important medical radioisotopes - including $^{32}$P, $^{60}$Co, $^{64}$Cu, $^{89}$Sr, $^{90}$Y, $^{89}$Zr, $^{99}$Mo/$^{99\mathrm{m}}$Tc, $^{103}$Pd, $^{111}$In, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{123}$I, $^{125}$I, $^{131}$I, $^{133}$Xe, $^{153}$Sm, $^{166}$Ho, $^{177}$Lu, $^{188}$Re, and $^{192}$Ir-and emerging isotopes such as $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Ru/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{103}$Pd/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{119}$Sb, $^{124}$I, $^{155}$Tb, $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, and $^{225}$Ac with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical separation of the product. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.</description>

      <title>Indications for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shape polarization and coexistence of high-$K$ three-quasiparticle states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-quasiparticle $K$-isomeric states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones within the $A\sim 180$ mass region are systematically investigated using configuration-constrained potential energy surface calculations. The calculations successfully reproduce the excitation energies and deformations of known high-$K$ isomers in the nuclei from $^{175}$Tm to $^{181}$Re. For the nuclei closer to the $Z=82$ shell closure ($^{183}$Ir, $^{185}$Au, and $^{187}$Tl), predictions for the configurations of observed and yet-to-be-observed isomers are provided. The results reveal strong shape polarization, where the three-quasiparticle states are driven to larger deformations compared to the often shape-soft or spherical ground states. A particularly rich spectrum of shape coexistence is predicted in $^{187}$Tl, where several high-$K$ three-quasiparticle configurations with distinct prolate, oblate, and triaxial shapes are found to coexist at similar excitation energies. Notably, the oblate-deformed $K^{\pi}=29/2^+$ configuration at $E_x = 1839$ keV is proposed to be responsible for a long-lived isomer. This study provides a comprehensive picture of shape evolution and coexistence in high-$K$ multi-quasiparticle states, offering valuable insights for future experimental research.</description>

      <title>Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlation" is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Topmetal-L: A Low Noise Charge-Sensitive Pixel Sensor for POLAR2/LPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2$\sim$10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $\mu$m$^2$ charge-collecting window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0$\sim$4 ke$^{-}$, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\mu$V/e$^{-}$, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e$^{-}$, a sensitive area exceeding 3.69 cm$^2$, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.05 keV source, and a count rate saturated at 15 k counts$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ when tested at 5.40 keV.</description>
