      <title>Wind and nearby stellar environment of the quiescent luminous blue variable Var 2 in the Galaxy M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the study of the luminous blue variable (LBV) Var 2 in the galaxy M33, which is currently in a "dormant" state and is observed as an Of/late-WN star. We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$), current mass ($M_* \approx23\,M_\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\rm X}_{\rm H}\approx43\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\rm init}\approx50\,M_\odot$ and age $t_{\rm age}\approx5.0\times10^6\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\dot{M}=2.1\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\infty\approx230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\sim100\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.</description>

      <title>Preferential accretion of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Links: From Gaia Neutron Star Binaries to Pulsar White Dwarf Endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only &lt;1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>A (very) simple proof of the gravitational energy formula of polytropic spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown how the well-known formula for the gravitational energy of self-gravitating regular polytropes of finite mass can be obtained in an elementary way by using Gauss's divergence theorem and the Chandrasekhar virial tensor, without resorting to lengthy algebra, to specific properties of Lane-Emden functions, and to thermodynamics arguments, as is instead commonly found in standard treatises and in astrophysical literature. The present approach, due to its simplicity, can be particularly useful to students and researchers, and it can be easily applied to the study of more complicated polytropic structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Decay Index Profile and Coronal Mass Ejection Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the height profile of the ambient magnetic field, quantified by its decay index, n(h). Our sample is composed of 15 very fast CMEs (Vcme &gt; 1500 km/s; all halo CMEs) and 22 halo CMEs below this speed limit from Solar Cycle 23. The very fast CMEs yield a high correlation of 0.81 between Vcme and the slope of n(h) in a height range above the onset height of the torus instability if one extremely fast outlier, which closely followed another very fast CME, is excluded. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the torus instability plays a decisive role in CME acceleration. The whole sample yields a weaker correlation, which is still significant if events with a broad torus-stable dip in n(h) are excluded. A parametric simulation study of flux-rope eruptions from quadrupolar and two-scale bipolar source regions confirms the decelerating effect of such dips. Very fast, moderate-velocity, and confined eruptions are found.</description>

      <title>Abundances of Rarely Detected s-process Elements Derived from the Ultraviolet Spectrum of the s-process-enhanced Metal-poor Star HD 196944</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the heavy-element abundances of HD 196944, a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star enriched with elements produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process). We obtained a new high-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of this star, the UV-brightest known CEMP-s star, with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. This spectrum extends deeper into the UV (2029 &lt; lambda &lt; 2303 Angstroms) than previous studies of any CEMP-s star. When combined with previous UV and optical analysis, a total of 35 elements heavier than zinc (Z = 30) can be detected in HD 196944, and upper limits are available for nine other heavy elements. The abundances can be well fit by models of s-process nucleosynthesis operating in a low-mass companion star that evolved through the asymptotic giant branch phase and transferred heavy elements to HD 196944. This s-process event did not contribute substantially to the Ga, Ge, or As abundances (31 &lt;= Z &lt;= 33). Our results demonstrate that UV spectroscopy can greatly expand the inventory of heavy elements detectable in CEMP-s stars.</description>

      <title>Polar Filaments Capture High Latitude Solar Poloidal Field Interactions and can Foretell the Future Sunspot Cycle Amplitude before Polar Field Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Violent mergers can explain the inflated state of some of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$_\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.</description>

      <title>YSO Variability in the W51 Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (&gt;2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the March 2022 ICME Revealed by Multi-Point Observations of Forbush Decreases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of new magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars and impact of magnetism on pulsation excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. At this time, the list of known magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars is extremely limited, with only a handful of well-studied examples. Aims. We seek to expand this list, by retrieving targets from a variety of sources and demonstrating that they present simultaneously a surface magnetic field signature and {\delta} Scuti pulsations. Methods. We obtained archival and new spectropolarimetric datasets for a variety of known {\delta} Scuti stars and analysed them using the Least Squares Deconvolution method to generate mean Stokes I and V profiles for each target, from which we can determine longitudinal magnetic field measurements. Additionally, we assessed photometric data from the TESS satellite to discern frequency peaks consistent with {\delta} Scuti pulsations in known magnetic stars, and to identify magnetic candidates via rotational modulation. Results. We present a compiled list of all the confirmed magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars discovered to date, containing 13 stars. The majority of this sample lies outside the usual {\delta} Scuti instability strip in the H-R diagram, though we do not observe any specific correlations between magnetic field strength and various stellar parameters. This indicates that strong global magnetic fields play a fundamental role in shaping interior structure and processes. Magnetic fields thus must be included in realistic stellar models in order to more accurately predict structure and evolution. Conclusions. This work constitutes the largest database to date of strongly magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars, one that will continue to grow over time with subsequent studies.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectral signatures of light r-process elements in kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question regarding neutron star mergers is whether they are able to produce all the r-process elements, from first to third peak. The high abundances of first-peak elements (atomic number $Z \sim 31-40$) in the solar composition means they may dominate the ejecta mass in kilonovae. We here study theoretical infrared signatures of such light elements with spectral synthesis modelling. By combining state-of-the-art NLTE physics with new radiative and collisional data for these elements, we identify several promising diagnostic lines from Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr and Zr. The models give self-consistent line luminosities and indicate specific features that probe emission volumes at early phases ($\sim$10d), the product of ion mass and electron density in late phases ($\gtrsim$75d), and in some cases direct ionic masses at intermediate phases. Emission by [Se I] 5.03 \mum\ + [Se III] 4.55 \mum\ can produce satisfactory fits to the Spitzer photometry of AT2017gfo. However, the models show consistently that with a Kr/Te and Se/Te ratio following the solar r-process pattern, Kr + Se emission is dominant over Te for the blend at 2.1 \mum\ observed in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. The somewhat better line profile fit with [Te III] may suggest that both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi had a strongly sub-solar production of the light r-process elements. An alternative scenario could be that Kr + Se in an asymmetric morphological distribution generates the feature. Further JWST spectral data, in particular covering the so far unobserved $&gt;5$ \mum\ region, holds promise to determine the light r-process production of kilonovae, and in particular whether the light elements are made in a slow disk wind or in a fast proto-NS outflow. We identify specific needs for further atomic data on recombination rates and collision strengths for $Z=31-40$ elements.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic calibration of the Rossby number and its connection to the stellar dynamo and fundamental properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar Rossby number, a dimensionless parameter quantifying the influence of Coriolis forces on convective motions, plays a pivotal role in understanding magnetic stellar evolution. In this work, we explore the connection between the Rossby number and potential dynamo mechanisms in Sun-like stars, as well as its dependence on fundamental stellar properties. We present a novel, detailed asteroseismic calibration of the convective turnover time, incorporating for the first time Gaia photometry alongside surface gravity, effective temperature, and stellar metallicity. Our analysis employs an expanded sample of more than 150 stars, including targets from the Kepler LEGACY and KOI surveys, as well as more evolved stars observed by TESS and K2. This sample spans evolutionary stages from the main sequence to the early red giant branch (RGB), enabling a comprehensive investigation of Rossby number trends across stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutard (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</description>

      <title>A 50-min coronal kink oscillation and its possible photospheric counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coronal loop of 290~Mm length, observed at 171~\AA\ with SDO/AIA on February 6th 2024 near AR 13571, is found to oscillate with two significantly different oscillation periods, $48.8 \pm 6.1$~min and $4.8\pm 0.3$~min. The oscillations occur in the time intervals without detected flares or eruptions. Simultaneously, near the Northern footpoint of the oscillating loop, we detect a $49.6 \pm 5.0$-min periodic variation of the average projected photospheric magnetic field observed with SDO/HMI. The shorter-period decayless oscillation is attributed to the eigen-mode, standing kink oscillation of the loop, while the longer-period oscillation may be the oscillatory motion caused by the periodic footpoint driver. The photospheric long-period process can also drive the short-period, eigen oscillation of the loop via the self-oscillatory, \lq\lq violin\rq\rq\, mechanism, in which a transverse oscillation is excited by an external quasi-steady flow. This finding indicates that the most powerful, lower-frequency spectral components of photospheric motions, which are well below the Alfv\'enic/kink cutoff, can reach the corona.</description>

      <title>A constant upper luminosity limit of cool supergiant stars down to the extremely low metallicity of I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar wind mass loss is often assumed to depend on their metallicity $Z$. Therefore, evolutionary models of massive stars at lower $Z$ are able to retain more of their H-rich layers and evolve into brighter cool supergiants (cool SGs; $T_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 7$ kK). Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$ previous studies did not find a $Z$-dependence of the upper luminosity limit $L_\mathrm{max}$ of cool SGs. Here, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the extremely low-$Z$ dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to $Z / Z_\odot \approx 1/40$. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18, we find a constant $L_\mathrm{max} \approx 10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$, similar to literature results for $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$. In I Zw 18 and the other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed. Although we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature objects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with $L&gt;10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$ burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low $Z$. We argue that $Z$-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely mechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the Early Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a contribution of stars born with $M\gtrsim 30$M$_\odot$ to its surprisingly strong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low $Z$ emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C IV. In this scenario, late-phase $Z$-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich stars. Due to the well-understood $Z$-dependence of radiation-driven winds of hot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z$_\odot$, where self-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard ionizing radiation.</description>

      <title>The MIRI Excesses around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey I: A candidate cold brown dwarf in orbit around the nearby white dwarf 2MASS J09424023-4637176</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIRI Excesses Around Degenerates Survey is a Cycle 2 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Survey program designed to image nearby white dwarfs in the mid-IR with the MIRI imaging mode. Only a handful of white dwarfs have previously been observed beyond 8~\micron. This survey gathered observations for 56 white dwarfs within 25~pc at 10 and 15~\micron, probing each white dwarf for unresolved IR excesses, IR flux deficits indicative of collision induced absorption, or resolved substellar companions. We present in this paper observations of our first target, 2MASS J09424023-4637176, (also UCAC4 217-039132), henceforth called MEAD 62. It is a magnetic DA white dwarf with an estimated age of $7.6^{+1.7}_{-2.2}$\,Gyr. A red candidate companion, MEAD 62B, about 2 magnitudes fainter at 15\,$\mu$m than the white dwarf is detected at an apparent separation of 1.95". If confirmed, MEAD 62B, would be a $0.014^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$\,\Msun\, brown dwarf with T$_{\rm eff} = 343^{+7}_{-11}$\,K, according to ATMO2020 evolutionary models. Although its red F1000W$-$F1500W color is similar to background galaxies, MEAD 62B, is consistent with being an unresolved point-source from empirical PSF fitting. A false positive analysis yields an expectation number of 0.66 red (F1000W$-$F1500$ \geq +0.80$\,mag) unresolved sources within the same separation (r$\leq2$ arcsec) for the entire MEAD survey. Thus, this candidate companion as likely to be an actual companion as a false-positive unresolved background galaxy. Additional observations to measure common proper motion or sample the SED are warranted to confirm the nature of MEAD 62B. A deep near-infrared imaging detection is achievable from the ground while JWST is needed at longer infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Formation of protostars and the launching of stellar core outflows with moving-mesh radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}&gt; 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($&lt;0.5$~au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Enigmatic centi-SFU and mSFU nonthermal radio transients detected in the middle corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades of solar coronal observations have provided substantial evidence for accelerated particles in the corona. In most cases, the location of particle acceleration can be roughly identified by combining high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments across a broad frequency range. In almost all cases, these nonthermal particles are associated with quiescent active regions, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Only recently, some evidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these well-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time multiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of $\sim 3-7R_\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other wavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were made possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency radio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array. While earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric distances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were primarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here. Thus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely dynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only becoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.
  Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.
  However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.
  Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.
  We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.
  The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.
  We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$.
  Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</description>

      <title>Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution (&lt;0.1") Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on (i~80 deg) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") obtained across six broadband filters spanning 0.4-1.6 microns. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (~14", or ~4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ~10" from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.</description>

Abstract: We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (&gt;400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Using simultaneous mass accretion and external photoevaporation rates for d203-504 to constrain disc evolution processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. &lt;0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.</description>

      <title>JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>The Influence of the Accretion Disc Structure on X-ray Spectral States in Symbiotic Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binary systems where a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from the wind of an evolved, late-type companion. X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems are classified into $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, and $\beta/\delta$ types, attributed to distinct physical mechanisms such as thermonuclear burning, wind interactions, and accretion-driven boundary layers. We present synthetic X-ray spectra derived from hydrodynamics simulations using the PHANTOM code, coupled with radiative-transfer calculations from SKIRT. We reproduce all X-ray spectral types by exploring different density structure of the accretion disc, the viewing angle, the plasma temperature of the boundary layer, and/or the presence of extended emission. The synthetic X-ray spectra consist of both absorbed and reflected components. In systems with massive, high-column density discs and viewing angles close to edge-on, the reflected continuum can dominate the X-ray emission. This effect is less pronounced in systems with low-mass, lower-column density discs. We explore i) systems going from $\delta$ to $\beta$ states, ii) $\delta$-types that become $\beta/\delta$ sources, iii) the variability of the three Fe emission lines in the 6.0-7.0 energy range, and iv) the possible physical processes behind the $\alpha$ sources. The observations from iconic symbiotic systems are discussed in line of the present models. Our framework offers predictive power for future X-ray monitoring and provides a path toward connecting accretion disc physics with observed spectral states in symbiotic binaries with accreting WDs.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short--period ($P&lt;$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($&gt;$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, so-called Type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars I: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near-infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT $J$ and $K$-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{\rm F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim7.7\times10^{3}$ stars with $M_{\rm J} \lesssim -6$). We find that only $\sim1000$ AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially-resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{\rm M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's stellar halo $3-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-3$ Gyr ago; (ii) $M_{\star}\approx3_{-1}^{+5}\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim14$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>
