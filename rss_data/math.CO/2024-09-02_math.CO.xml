      <title>Braid graphs in simply-laced triangle-free Coxeter systems are median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any two reduced expressions for the same Coxeter group element are related by a sequence of commutation and braid moves. Two reduced expressions are said to be braid equivalent if they are related via a sequence of braid moves. Braid equivalence is an equivalence relation and the corresponding equivalence classes are called braid classes. Each braid class can be encoded in terms of a braid graph in a natural way. In a recent paper, Awik et al.~proved that when a Coxeter system is simply laced and triangle free (i.e., the corresponding Coxeter graph has no three-cycles), the braid graph for a reduced expression is a partial cube (i.e., isometric to a subgraph of a hypercube). In this paper, we will provide an alternate proof of this fact, as well as determine the minimal dimension hypercube into which a braid graph can be isometrically embedded, which addresses an open question posed by Awik et al. For our main result, we prove that braid graphs in simply-laced triangle-free Coxeter systems are median, which is a strengthening of previous results.</description>

      <title>On symmetric hollow integer matrices with eigenvalues bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hollow matrix is a square matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to zero. Define $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, where $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. We show that for every $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if a symmetric hollow integer matrix has an eigenvalue less than $-\lambda$, then one of its principal submatrices of order at most $n$ does as well. However, the same conclusion does not hold for any $\lambda \ge \lambda^*$.</description>

      <title>Zero attractors of hook polynomials and related questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zero attractors for polynomials built from partition statistics, complementing earlier work in this direction by Boyer, Goh, Parry, and others. In particular, using analytic methods we establish the zero attractor of partition $t$-hook polynomials for $t \geq 6$, addressing a question of Males with two of the authors. We also discuss some open problems and present data on other polynomial families, including those associated to deformations of Rogers--Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Burge Correspondence and $k$-measure of Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be the set of integer partitions and $D$ the subset of those with distinct parts. We extend a correspondence of Burge between partitions and binary words to give encodings of both $D$ and $D$ as words over a $k$-ary alphabet, for any fixed $k\geq 2$. These are used to prove refinements of two partition identities involving $k$-measure that were recently derived algebraically by Andrews, Chern and Li. The relationship between our encoding of $D$ and minimum gap-size partition identities (e.g. Schur's Theorem) is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Stable matchings, choice functions, and linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of stable edge sets (``matchings'') in a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the preferences for vertices of one side (``firms'') are given via choice functions subject to standard axioms of consistence, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity, whereas the preferences for the vertices of the other side (``workers') via linear orders. For such a model, we present a combinatorial description of the structure of rotations and develop an algorithm to construct the poset of rotations, in time $O(|E|^2)$ (including oracle calls). As a consequence, one can obtain a ``compact'' affine representation of stable matchings and efficiently solve some related problems. (The paper is written in Russian.)</description>

      <title>Characterising rooted and unrooted tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks are used by biologists to infer and represent complex evolutionary relationships between species that cannot be accurately explained by a phylogenetic tree. Tree-child networks are a particular class of rooted phylogenetic networks that has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we give a novel characterisation of a tree-child network $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of cherry-picking sequences that are sequences on the leaves of $\mathcal{R}$ and reduce it to a single vertex by repeatedly applying one of two reductions to its leaves. We show that our characterisation extends to unrooted tree-child networks which are mostly unexplored in the literature and, in turn, also offers a new approach to settling the computational complexity of deciding if an unrooted phylogenetic network can be oriented as a rooted tree-child network.</description>

      <title>Multigraded strong Lefschetz property for balanced simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra, we introduce the multigraded strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded algebra. We show that, for $\bm{a} \in \mathbb{N}^m_+$, the generic $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded Artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an $\bm{a}$-balanced homology sphere over a field of characteristic $2$ satisfies the multigraded strong Lefschetz property. A corollary is the inequality $h_{\bm{b}} \leq h_{\bm{c}}$ for $\bm{b} \leq \bm{c} \leq \bm{a}-\bm{b}$ among the flag $h$-numbers of an $\bm{a}$-balanced simplicial sphere. This can be seen as a common generalization of the unimodality of the $h$-vector of a simplicial sphere by Adiprasito and the balanced generalized lower bound inequality by Juhnke-Kubitzke and Murai. We further generalize these results to $\bm{a}$-balanced homology manifolds and $\bm{a}$-balanced simplicial cycles over a field of characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial bounds for monochromatic tight cycle partition in $r$-edge-coloured $K_n^{(k)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_n^{(k)}$ be the complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices. A $k$-uniform tight cycle is a $k$-graph with its vertices cyclically ordered so that every $k$ consecutive vertices form an edge and any two consecutive edges share exactly $k-1$ vertices. A result of Bustamante, Corsten, Frankl, Pokrovskiy and Skokan shows that all $r$-edge coloured $K_{n}^{(k)}$ can be partitioned into $c_{r,k}$ vertex disjoint monochromatic tight cycles. However, the constant $c_{r,k}$ is of tower-type. In this work, we show that $c_{r, k}$ is a polynomial in $r$.</description>

      <title>Tournament transitivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{tournament transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ and $V_j$ does not dominate $V_i$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called \emph{tournament transitivity} of $G$, and it is denoted by $TTr(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Tournament Transitivity Problem} is to find a tournament transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. In this article, we study this variation of transitive partition from a structural and algorithmic point of view. We show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs(connected), perfect elimination bipartite graphs(disconnected), and doubly chordal(disconnected). On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for trees.</description>

      <title>On log-concavity of the number of orbits in commuting tuples of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $A(p, n, k)$ the number of commuting $p$-tuples of permutations on $[n]$ that have exactly $k$ distinct orbits. It was conjectured in~\cite{abdesselam2023log} that $A(p, n, k)$ is log-concave with respect to $k$ for every $p\geq 2, n\geq 3$, and the log-concavity was proved in ``$p=\infty$" case. In this paper, we prove that for $k=n-\alpha$, the log-concavity for $A(p, n, k)$ holds for every $p\geq 2$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>On the Metric Dimension of $K_a \times K_b \times K_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we determine the metric dimension of $ K_a \times K_b \times K_c$ for all $a,b,c\in \mathbb N$ with $ a \le b \le c $ as follows. For $3a&lt;b+c$ and $2b \le c$, this value is $c-1$, for $3a&lt;b+c$ and $2b &gt; c$, it is $\left \lfloor \frac{2}{3}(b+c-1) \right \rfloor$, and for $3a=b+c$, it is $\left \lfloor \frac{a+b+c}{2} \right \rfloor -1 $. The only open case is $3a&gt;b+c$, where two values are possible, namely $\left \lfloor \frac{a+b+c}{2} \right \rfloor -1 $ and $\left \lfloor \frac{a+b+c}{2} \right \rfloor $. This result extends previous results of C\'acere et al., who computed the metric dimension of $ K_a \times K_b$, and of Drewes and J\"ager, who computed the metric dimension of $ K_a \times K_a \times K_a$.
  We prove our result by introducing and analyzing a new variant of Static Black-Peg Mastermind, in which each peg has its own permitted set of colors. For all cases, we present strategies which we prove to be both feasible and optimal. Our main result follows, as the number of questions of these strategies is equal to the metric dimension of $K_a \times K_b \times K_c$.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in Linear Chord Diagrams: Bridges and Crystallized Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a linear chord diagram a short chord joins adjacent vertices while a bubble is a region devoid of short chords. We define a bridge to be a chord joining a vertex interior to a bubble to one exterior to it. Building on earlier work, we investigate the distribution of bridges in the limit of large bubbles and diagrams, and show that the number of bridges is asymptotically normal, obtaining expressions for the associated mean and variance as a function of bubble size. We introduce the notion of a crystallized diagram, defined by the criteria that all its chords are either short or are bridges. We count the number of crystallized diagrams by the number of short chords they contain, and provide the asymptotic distribution in the limit of large crystallized diagrams. We show that for very large diagrams, the number of short chords is normal, and sharply peaked at $\sqrt{2n/\log
  n}$, where $n$ is the total number of chords in the diagram.</description>

      <title>Mutual-visibility and general position sets in Sierpi\'nski triangle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph \(G\), the general position problem asks for the largest set of vertices \(M \subseteq V(G)\) such that no three distinct vertices of \(M\) belong to a common shortest path in \(G\). A relaxation of this concept is based on the condition that two vertices \(x, y \in V(G)\) are \(M\)-visible, meaning there exists a shortest \(x, y\)-path in \(G\) that does not pass through any vertex of \(M \setminus \{x, y\}\).
  If every pair of vertices in \(M\) is \(M\)-visible, then \(M\) is called a mutual-visibility set of \(G\). The size of the largest mutual-visibility set of \(G\) is called the mutual-visibility number of \(G\). Some well-known variations of this concept consider the total, outer, and dual mutual-visibility sets of a graph.
  We present results on the general position problem and the various mutual-visibility problems in Sierpi\'nski triangle graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flagged refined stable Grothendieck polynomials of skew shapes generalize several polynomials like stable Grothendieck polynomials, flagged skew Schur polynomials. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial expansion of the flagged refined skew stable Grothendieck polynomial in terms of key polynomials. We present this expansion by imposing a Demazure crystal structure on the set of flagged semi-standard set-valued tableaux of a given skew shape and a flag. We also provide expansions of the row-refined stable Grothendieck polynomials and refined dual stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of stable Grothendieck polynomials $G_{\lambda}$ and in terms of dual stable Grothendieck polynomials $g_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Maximal almost rigid modules over gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study maximal almost rigid modules over a gentle algebra $A$. We prove that the number of indecomposable direct summands of every maximal almost rigid $A$-module is equal to the sum of the number of vertices and the number of arrows of the Gabriel quiver of $A$. Moreover, the algebra $A$, considered as an $A$-module, can be completed to a maximal almost rigid module in a unique way.
  Gentle algebras are precisely the tiling algebras of surfaces with marked points. We show that the (permissible) triangulations of the surface of $A$ are in bijection with the maximal almost rigid $A$-modules.
  Furthermore, we study the endomorphism algebra $C=\text{End}_A T$ of a maximal almost rigid module $T$. We construct a fully faithful functor $G\colon \text{mod}\,A\to \text{mod}\, \overline{A}$ into the module category of a bigger gentle algebra $\overline{A}$ and show that $G$ maps maximal almost rigid $A$-modules to tilting $\overline{A}$-modules. In particular, $C$ and $\overline{A}$ are derived equivalent and $C$ is gentle.
  After giving a geometric realization of the functor $G$, we obtain a tiling $G(\mathbf{T})$ of the surface of $\overline{A}$ as the image of the triangulation $\mathbf{T}$ corresponding to $T$. We then show that the tiling algebra of $G(\mathbf{T})$ is $C$. Moreover, the tiling algebra of $\mathbf{T}$ is obtained algebraically from $C$ as the tensor algebra with respect to the $C$-bimodule $\text{Ext}_C^2(DC,C)$, which also is fundamental in cluster-tilting theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Promise Version of Unique Sink Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unique sink orientation (USO) is an orientation of the edges of a hypercube such that each face has a unique sink. Many optimization problems like linear programs reduce to USOs, in the sense that each vertex corresponds to a possible solution, and the global sink corresponds to the optimal solution. People have been studying intensively the problem of find the sink of a USO using vertex evaluations, i.e., queries which return the orientation of the edges around a vertex. This problem is a so called promise problem, as it assumes that the orientation it receives is a USO.
  In this paper, we analyze a non-promise version of the USO problem, in which we try to either find a sink or an efficiently verifiable violation of the USO property. This problem is worth investigating, because some problems which reduce to USO are also promise problems (and so we can also define a non-promise version for them), and it would be interesting to discover where USO lies in the hierarchy of subclasses of $\texttt{TFNP}^\texttt{dt}$, and for this a total search problem is required (which is the case for the non-promise version).
  We adapt many known properties and algorithms from the promise version to the non-promise one, including known algorithms for small dimensions and lower and upper bounds, like the Fibonacci Seesaw Algorithm. Furthermore, we present an efficient resolution proof of the problem, which shows it is in the search complexity class $\texttt{PLS}^\texttt{dt}$ (although this fact was already known via reductions). Finally, although initially the only allowed violations consist of $2$ vertices, we generalize them to more vertices, and provide a full categorization of violations with $4$ vertices, showing that they are also efficiently verifiable.</description>

      <title>From free idempotent monoids to free multiplicatively idempotent rigs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiplicatively idempotent rig (which we abbreviate to mirig) is a rig satisfying the equation r2 = r. We show that a free mirig on finitely many generators is finite and compute its size. This work was originally motivated by a collaborative effort on the decentralized social network Mastodon to compute the size of the free mirig on two generators.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for end spaces of infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12670v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-spaces of infinite graphs naturally generalise the Freudenthal boundary and sit at the interface between graph theory, geometric group theory and topology.
  Our main result is that every end-space can topologically be represented by a special order tree. Our main proof ingredient is a structure theorem that we introduce, which carves out the order-tree-like structure of any graph in such a way that there is a natural bijection between the ends of the graph and the limit-type down-closed chains of the order-tree.</description>

      <title>Embedding theorems for random graphs with specified degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix $W\in [0,1]^{[n]\times [n]}$, let $\mathcal{G}(n,W)$ be the random graph obtained by independently including each edge $jk$ with probability $W_{jk}$. Given a degree sequence ${\bf d}=(d_1,\ldots, d_n)$, let $\mathcal{G}(n,{\bf d})$ denote a uniformly random graph with degree sequence ${\bf d}$. We couple $\mathcal{G}(n,W)$ and $\mathcal{G}(n,{\bf d})$ together so that a.a.s. $\mathcal{G}(n,W)$ is a subgraph of $\mathcal{G}(n,{\bf d})$, where $W$ is some function of ${\bf d}$. Let $\Delta({\bf d})$ denote the maximum degree in ${\bf d}$. Our coupling result is optimal when $\Delta({\bf d})^2\ll \|{\bf d}\|_1$, i.e.\ $W_{ij}$ is asymptotic to $\mathbb{P}(ij\in \mathcal{G}(n,{\bf d}))$ for every $i,j\in [n]$. We also have coupling results for ${\bf d}$ that are not constrained by the condition $\Delta({\bf d})^2\ll \|{\bf d}\|_1$. For such ${\bf d}$ our coupling result is still close to optimal, in the sense that $W_{ij}$ is asymptotic to $\mathbb{P}(ij\in \mathcal{G}(n,{\bf d}))$ for most pairs $i,j\in [n]$.</description>

      <title>Lasserre Hierarchy for Graph Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that feasibility of the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy for graph isomorphism can be expressed as a homomorphism indistinguishability relation. In other words, we define a class $\mathcal{L}_t$ of graphs such that graphs $G$ and $H$ are not distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any graph in $\mathcal{L}_t$. By analysing the treewidth of graphs in $\mathcal{L}_t$, we prove that the $3t^\text{th}$ level of Sherali--Adams linear programming hierarchy is as strong as the $t^\text{th}$ level of Lasserre. Moreover, we show that this is best possible in the sense that $3t$ cannot be lowered to $3t-1$ for any $t$. The same result holds for the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints, which we similarly characterise in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability over a family $\mathcal{L}_t^+$ of graphs. Additionally, we give characterisations of level-$t$ Lasserre with non-negativity constraints in terms of logical equivalence and via a graph colouring algorithm akin to the Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm. This provides a polynomial time algorithm for determining if two given graphs are distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Tournaments and the Orientation Completion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed finite set of finite tournaments ${\mathcal F}$, the ${\mathcal F}$-free orientation problem asks whether a given finite undirected graph $G$ has an $\mathcal F$-free orientation, i.e., whether the edges of $G$ can be oriented so that the resulting digraph does not embed any of the tournaments from ${\mathcal F}$. We prove that for every ${\mathcal F}$, this problem is in P or NP-complete. Our proof reduces the classification task to a complete complexity classification of the orientation completion problem for ${\mathcal F}$, which is the variant of the problem above where the input is a directed graph instead of an undirected graph, introduced by Bang-Jensen, Huang, and Zhu (2017). Our proof uses results from the theory of constraint satisfaction, and a result of Agarwal and Kompatscher (2018) about infinite permutation groups and transformation monoids.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku [17],we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Counting pattern-avoiding permutations by big descents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A descent $k$ of a permutation $\pi=\pi_{1}\pi_{2}\dots\pi_{n}$ is called a big descent if $\pi_{k}&gt;\pi_{k+1}+1$; denote the number of big descents of $\pi$ by $\operatorname{bdes}(\pi)$. We study the distribution of the $\operatorname{bdes}$ statistic over permutations avoiding prescribed sets of length-three patterns. Specifically, we classify all pattern sets $\Pi\subseteq\mathfrak{S}_{3}$ of size 1 and 2 into $\operatorname{bdes}$-Wilf equivalence classes, and we derive a formula for the distribution of big descents for each of these classes. Our methods include generating function techniques along with various bijections involving objects such as Dyck paths and binary words. Several future directions of research are proposed, including conjectures concerning real-rootedness, log-concavity, and Schur positivity.</description>

      <title>A Connection Between Unbordered Partial Words and Sparse Rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\textit{Partial words}$ are words that contain, in addition to letters, special symbols $\diamondsuit$ called $\textit{holes}$. Two partial words of $a=a_0 \dots a_n$ and $b=b_0 \dots b_n$ are $\textit{compatible}$ if for all $i$, $a_i = b_i$ or at least one of $a_i, b_i$ is a hole. A partial word is $\textit{unbordered}$ if it does not have a nonempty proper prefix and a suffix that are compatible. Otherwise the partial word is $\textit{bordered}$.
  A set $R \subseteq \{0, \dots, n\}$ is called a $\textit{complete sparse ruler of length $n$}$ if for all $k \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ there exists $r, s \in R$ such that $k = r - s$. These are also known as $\textit{restricted difference bases}$.
  From the definitions it follows that the more holes a partial word has, the more likely it is to be bordered. By introducing a connection between unbordered partial words and sparse rulers, we improve bounds on the maximum number of holes an unbordered partial word can have over alphabets of sizes $4$ or greater. We also provide a counterexample for a previously reported theorem.
  We then study a two-dimensional generalization of these results. We adapt methods from one-dimensional case to solve the correct asymptotic for the number of holes an unbordered two-dimensional binary partial word can have. This generalization might invoke further research questions.</description>
