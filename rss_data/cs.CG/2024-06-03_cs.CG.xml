      <title>Euclidean Maximum Matchings in the Plane---Local to Global</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a perfect matching on a set of points in the plane where every edge is a line segment between two points. We say that $M$ is globally maximum if it is a maximum-length matching on all points. We say that $M$ is $k$-local maximum if for any subset $M'=\{a_1b_1,\dots,a_kb_k\}$ of $k$ edges of $M$ it holds that $M'$ is a maximum-length matching on points $\{a_1,b_1,\dots,a_k,b_k\}$. We show that local maximum matchings are good approximations of global ones.
  Let $\mu_k$ be the infimum ratio of the length of any $k$-local maximum matching to the length of any global maximum matching, over all finite point sets in the Euclidean plane. It is known that $\mu_k\geqslant \frac{k-1}{k}$ for any $k\geqslant 2$. We show the following improved bounds for $k\in\{2,3\}$: $\sqrt{3/7}\leqslant\mu_2&lt; 0.93 $ and $\sqrt{3}/2\leqslant\mu_3&lt; 0.98$. We also show that every pairwise crossing matching is unique and it is globally maximum.
  Towards our proof of the lower bound for $\mu_2$ we show the following result which is of independent interest: If we increase the radii of pairwise intersecting disks by factor $2/\sqrt{3}$, then the resulting disks have a common intersection.</description>

      <title>The Gestalt Computational Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widely employed in cognitive psychology, Gestalt theory elucidates basic principles in visual perception, but meanwhile presents significant challenges for computation. The advancement of artificial intelligence requires the emulation of human cognitive behavior, for which Gestalt theory serves as a fundamental framework describing human visual cognitive behavior. In this paper, we utilize persistent homology, a mathematical tool in computational topology, to develop a computational model for Gestalt theory, addressing the challenges of quantification and computation. The Gestalt computational model not only holds promise for applications in artificial intelligence and computer vision, but also opens a new research direction of computational visual perception.</description>

      <title>Multirobot Watchman Routes in a Simple Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known \textsc{Watchman Route} problem seeks a shortest route in a polygonal domain from which every point of the domain can be seen. In this paper, we study the cooperative variant of the problem, namely the \textsc{$k$-Watchmen Routes} problem, in a simple polygon $P$. We look at both the version in which the $k$ watchmen must collectively see all of $P$, and the quota version in which they must see a predetermined fraction of $P$'s area.
  We give an exact pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the \textsc{$k$-Watchmen Routes} problem in a simple orthogonal polygon $P$ with the constraint that watchmen must move on axis-parallel segments, and there is a given common starting point on the boundary. Further, we give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and a constant-factor approximation for unconstrained movement. For the quota version, we give a constant-factor approximation in a simple polygon, utilizing the solution to the (single) \textsc{Quota Watchman Route} problem.</description>

      <title>CPAFT: A Consistent Parallel Advancing Front Technique for Unstructured Triangular/Tetrahedral Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with the remarkable progress made in parallel numerical solvers of partial differential equations,the development of algorithms for generating unstructured triangular/tetrahedral meshes has been relatively sluggish. In this paper, we propose a novel, consistent parallel advancing front technique (CPAFT) by combining the advancing front technique, the domain decomposition method based on space-filling curves, the distributed forest-of-overlapping-trees approach, and the consistent parallel maximal independent set algorithm. The newly proposed CPAFT algorithm can mathematically ensure that the generated unstructured triangular/tetrahedral meshes are independent of the number of processors and the implementation of domain decomposition. Several numerical tests are conducted to validate the parallel consistency and outstanding parallel efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which scales effectively up to two thousand processors. This is, as far as we know, the first parallel unstructured triangular/tetrahedral mesh generator with scalability to O(1,000) CPU processors.</description>

      <title>A census of graph-drawing algorithms based on generalized transversal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two graph drawing algorithms based on the recently defined "grand-Schnyder woods", which are a far-reaching generalization of the classical Schnyder woods. The first is a straight-line drawing algorithm for plane graphs with faces of degree 3 and 4 with no separating 3-cycle, while the second is a rectangular drawing algorithm for the dual of such plane graphs.
  In our algorithms, the coordinates of the vertices are defined in a global manner, based on the underlying grand-Schnyder woods. The grand-Schnyder woods and drawings are computed in linear time.
  When specializing our algorithms to special classes of plane graphs, we recover the following known algorithms: (1) He's algorithm for rectangular drawing of 3-valent plane graphs, based on transversal structures, (2) Fusy's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of triangulations of the square, based on transversal structures, (3) Bernardi and Fusy's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 4-valent plane graphs, based on 2-orientations, (4) Barriere and Huemer's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of quadrangulations, based on separating decompositions. 
  Our contributions therefore provide a unifying perspective on a large family of graph drawing algorithms that were originally defined on different classes of plane graphs and were based on seemingly different combinatorial structures.</description>
