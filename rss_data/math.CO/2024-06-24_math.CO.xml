      <title>A counterexample to conjecture "Catch 22" with 3 players, and 5 outcomes: 2 terminal and 3 cyclic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a finite deterministic graphical (DG) game without Nash equilibria in pure stationary strategies. This game has 3 players $I=\{1,2,3\}$ and 5 outcomes: 2 terminal $a_1$ and $a_2$ and 3 cyclic. Furthermore, for 2 players a terminal outcome is the best: $a_1$ for player 3 and $a_2$ for player 1. Hence, the rank vector $r$ is at most $(1,2,1)$. Here $r_i$ is the number of terminal outcomes that are worse than some cyclic outcome for the player $i \in I$. This is a counterexample to conjecture ``Catch 22" from the paper ``On Nash-solvability of finite $n$-person DG games, Catch 22" (2021) arXiv:2111.06278, according to which, at least 2 entries of $r$ are at least 2 for any NE-free game. However, Catch 22 remains still open for the games with a unique cyclic outcome, not to mention a weaker (and more important) conjecture claiming that an $n$-person finite DG game has a Nash equilibrium (in pure stationary strategies) when $r = (0^n)$, that is, all $n$ entries of $r$ are 0; in other words, when the following condition holds:
  $\qquad\bullet$ ($C_0$) any terminal outcome is better than every cyclic one for each player.
  A game is play-once if each player controls a unique position. It is known that any play-once game satisfying ($C_0$) has a Nash equilibrium. We give a new and very short proof of this statement. Yet, not only conjunction but already disjunction of the above two conditions may be sufficient for Nash-solvability. This is still open.</description>

      <title>On maximizing the number of heads when you need to set aside at least one coin every round</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: You play the following game: you start out with $n$ coins that all have probability $p$ to land heads. You toss all of them and you then need to set aside at least one of them, which will not be tossed again. Now you repeat the process with the remaining coins. This continues (for at most $n$ rounds) until all coins have been set aside. Your goal is to maximize the total number of heads you end up with. In this paper we will prove that there exists a constant $p_0 \approx 0.5495021777642$ such that, if $p_0 &lt; p \le 1$ and the number of remaining coins is large enough, then it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless all coins landed heads. When $\frac{1}{2} \le p \le p_0$, it is optimal to aside exactly one coin every round, unless at most one coin came up tails. Let $v_{n,p}$ be the expected number of heads you obtain when using the optimal strategy. We will show that $v_{n,p}$ is larger than or equal to $v_{n-1,p} + 1$ for all $n \ge 3$ and all $p \ge \frac{1}{2}$. When $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ there are infinitely many $n$ for which this inequality does not hold. Finally, we will see that for every $p$ with $0 &lt; p \le 1$ the sequence $n - v_{n,p}$ is convergent.</description>

      <title>Multi-quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents, Hopf algebras and Rota-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many years ago, G.-C.~Rota discovered a close connection between symmetric functions and Rota-Baxter algebras, and proposed to study generalizations of symmetric functions in the framework of Rota-Baxter algebras. Guided by this proposal, quasisymmetric functions from weak composition (instead of just compositions) were obtained from free Rota-Baxter algebras on one generator. This paper aims to generalize this approach to free Rota-Baxter algebras on multiple generators in order to obtain further generalizations of quasisymmetric functions. For this purpose and also for its independent interest, the space $\mathrm{MQSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions on multiple sequences of variables is defined, generalizing quasisymmetric functions and diagonally quasisymmetric functions of Aval, Bergeron and Bergeron. Linear bases of such multi-quasisymmetric functions are given by monomial multi-quasisymmetric functions and fundamental multi-quasisymmetric functions, the latter recover the fundamental $G^m$-quasisymmetric functions of Aval and Chapoton. Next introduced is the even more general notion of multi-quasisymmetric functions $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$ with exponents in a semigroup $E$, which also generalizes the quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents in a recent work. Through this approach, a natural Hopf algebraic structure is obtained on $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$. Finally, in support of Rota's proposal, the free commutative unitary Rota-Baxter algebra on a finite set is shown to be isomorphic to a scalar extension of $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$, a fact which in turn equips the free Rota-Baxter algebra with a Hopf algebra structure.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Relation for Bipartition Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a recursive relation for the bipartition number $p_2(n)$ which might be regarded as an analogue of Euler's recursive relation for the partition number $p(n)$. Two proofs of the main result are proved in this article. The first one is using the generating function, and the second one is using combinatoric objects (called ``symbols'') created by Lusztig for studying representation theory of finite classical groups.</description>

Abstract: We define and study q-delta-matroids, and q-g-matroids. These objects are analogues, for finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields, of delta-matroids and g-matroids arising from finite sets. We compare axiomatic descriptions with definitions by means of strong maps of q-matroids.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker resolving game played on corona products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker resolving game is a game played on a graph $G$ by Resolver and Spoiler. The players taking turns alternately in which each player selects a not yet played vertex of $G$. The goal of Resolver is to select all the vertices in a resolving set of $G$, while that of Spoiler is to prevent this from happening. The outcome $o(G)$ of the game played is one of $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{N}$, where $o(G)=\mathcal{R}$ (resp.\ $o(G)=\mathcal{S}$), if Resolver (resp.\ Spoiler) has a winning strategy no matter who starts the game, and $o(G)=\mathcal{N}$, if the first player has a winning strategy. In this paper, the game is investigated on corona products $G\odot H$ of graphs $G$ and $H$. It is proved that if $o(H)\in\{\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{S}\}$, then $o(G\odot H) = \mathcal{S}$. No such result is possible under the assumption $o(H) = \mathcal{R}$. It is proved that $o(G\odot P_k) = \mathcal{S}$ if $k=5$, otherwise $o(G\odot P_k) = \mathcal{R}$, and that $o(G\odot C_k) = \mathcal{S}$ if $k=3$, otherwise $o(G\odot C_k) = \mathcal{R}$. Several results are also given on corona products in which the second factor is of diameter at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Some Cases of the Erd\H{o}s-Lov\'asz Tihany Conjecture for Claw-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Lov\'asz Tihany Conjecture states that any $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G) = s + t - 1 &gt; \omega(G)$, with $s,t \geq 2$ can be split into two vertex-disjoint subgraphs of chromatic number $s, t$ respectively. We prove this conjecture for pairs $(s, t)$ if $t \leq s + 2$, whenever $G$ has a $K_s$, and for pairs $(s, t)$ if $t \leq 4 s - 3$, whenever $G$ contains a $K_s$ and is claw-free. We also prove the Erd\H{o}s Lov\'asz Tihany Conjecture for the pair $(3, 10)$ for claw-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Partition strategies for the Maker-Breaker domination game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game is a positional game played on a graph by two players called Dominator and Staller. The players alternately select a vertex of the graph that has not yet been chosen. Dominator wins if at some point the vertices she has chosen form a dominating set of the graph. Staller wins if Dominator cannot form a dominating set. Deciding if Dominator has a winning strategy has been shown to be a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to chordal or bipartite graphs. In this paper, we consider strategies for Dominator based on partitions of the graph into basic subgraphs where Dominator wins as the second player. Using partitions into cycles and edges (also called perfect [1,2]-factors), we show that Dominator always wins in regular graphs and that deciding whether Dominator has a winning strategy as a second player can be computed in polynomial time for outerplanar and block graphs. We then study partitions into subgraphs with two universal vertices, which is equivalent to considering the existence of pairing dominating sets with adjacent pairs. We show that in interval graphs, Dominator wins if and only if such a partition exists. In particular, this implies that deciding whether Dominator has a winning strategy playing second is in NP for interval graphs. We finally provide an algorithm in $n^{k+3}$ for $k$-nested interval graphs (i.e. interval graphs with at most $k$ intervals included one in each other).</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm will be open-sourced at time of publication.</description>

      <title>On the minimal period of integer tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a finite set $A$ tiles the integers by translations, it also admits a tiling whose period $M$ has the same prime factors as $|A|$. We prove that the minimal period of such a tiling is bounded by $\exp(c(\log D)^2/\log\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of $A$. In the converse direction, given $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2-\epsilon}$. We also discuss the relationship between minimal tiling period estimates and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dendric shift spaces simultaneously generalize codings of regular interval exchanges and episturmian shift spaces, themselves both generalizations of Sturmian words. One of the key properties enforced by dendricity is the Return Theorem. In this paper, we prove its converse, providing the following natural algebraic perspective on dendricity: A minimal shift space is dendric if and only if every set of return words is a basis of the free group over the alphabet.</description>

      <title>State Transfer and Readout Times for Trees of Diameter 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the state transfer properties of continuous time quantum walks on trees of diameter 4. We characterize all pairs of strongly cospectral vertices in trees of diameter 4, finding that they fall into pairs of three different types. For each type, we construct an infinite family of diameter 4 trees for which there is pretty good state transfer between the pair of strongly cospectral vertices. Moreover, for two of those types, for each tree in the infinite family, we give an explicit sequence of readout times at which the fidelity of state transfer converges to $1$. For strongly cospectral vertices of the remaining type, we identify a sequence of trees and explicit readout times so that the fidelity of state transfer between the strongly cospectral vertices approaches $1.$
  We also prove a result of independent interest: for a graph with the property that the fidelity of state transfer between a pair of vertices at time $t_k$ converges to $1$ as $k \rightarrow \infty,$ then the derivative of the fidelity at $t_k$ converges to $0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty. $</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theories of Classes Defined by Forbidden Homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the first-order almost-sure theories for classes of finite structures that are specified by homomorphically forbidding a set $\mathcal{F}$ of finite structures. If $\mathcal{F}$ consists of undirected graphs, a full description of these theories can be derived from the Kolaitis-Pr\"omel-Rothschild theorem, which treats the special case where $\mathcal{F} = \{K_n\}$. The corresponding question for finite sets $\mathcal{F}$ of finite directed graphs is wide open. We present a full description of the almost-sure theories of classes described by homomorphically forbidding finite sets $\mathcal{F}$ of oriented trees; all of them are $\omega$-categorical. In our proof, we establish a result of independent interest, namely that every constraint satisfaction problem for a finite digraph has first-order convergence, and that the corresponding asymptotic theory can be described as a finite linear combination of $\omega$-categorical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. Assume that to each vertex of a set of vertices $S\subseteq V(G)$ a robot is assigned. At each stage one robot can move to a neighbouring vertex. Then $S$ is a mobile general position set of $G$ if there exists a sequence of moves of the robots such that all the vertices of $G$ are visited whilst maintaining the general position property at all times. The mobile general position number of $G$ is the cardinality of a largest mobile general position set of $G$. In this paper, bounds on the mobile general position number are given and exact values determined for certain common classes of graphs including block graphs, rooted products, unicyclic graphs, Cartesian products, joins of graphs, Kneser graphs $K(n,2)$, and line graphs of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>A new sufficient condition for a 2-strong digraph to be Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following new sufficient condition for a digraph to be Hamiltonian:
  {\it Let $D$ be a 2-strong digraph of order $n\geq 9$.
  If $n-1$ vertices of $D$ have degrees at least $n+k$ and the remaining vertex has degree at least $n-k-4$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, then $D$ is Hamiltonian}.
  This is an extension of Ghouila-Houri's theorem for 2-strong digraphs and is a generalization of an early result of the author (DAN Arm. SSR (91(2):6-8, 1990). The obtained result is best possible in the sense that for $k=0$ there is a digraph of order $n=8$ (respectively, $n=9$) with the minimum degree $n-4=4$ (respectively, with the minimum $n-5=4$) whose $n-1$ vertices have degrees at least $n-1$, but it is not Hamiltonian.
  We also give a new sufficient condition for a 3-strong digraph to be Hamiltonian-connected.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Vertices/Edges whose Deletion Preserves the Konig-Egervary Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph G=(V,E) is called Konig-Egervary if the sum of its independence number and its matching number equals its order. Let RV(G) denote the number of vertices v such that G-v is Konig-Egervary, and let RE(G) denote the number of edges e such that G-e is Konig-Egervary. Clearly, RV(G) = |V| and RE(G) = |E| for bipartite graphs. Unlike the bipartiteness, the property of being a Konig-Egervary graph is not hereditary. In this paper, we present an equality expressing RV(G) in terms of some graph parameters, and a tight inequality bounding RE(G) in terms of the same parameters, when G is Konig-Egervary.</description>

      <title>On Certain Bounds for Multiset Dimensions of Zero-Divisor Graphs Associated with Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates multiset dimensions in zero divisor graphs (ZD-graphs) associated with rings. Through rigorous analysis, we establish general bounds for the multiset dimension (Mdim) in ZD-graphs, exploring various commutative rings including the ring Z_n of integers modulo n, Gaussian integers and quotient polynomial rings. Additionally, we examine the behavior of Mdim under algebraic operations and discuss bounds in terms of diameter and maximum degree. This study enhances our understanding of algebraic structures and their graphical representations.</description>

      <title>Degrees of P-Grothendieck polynomials and regularity of Pfaffian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the degrees of Ikeda and Naruse's $P$-Grothendieck polynomials using combinatorics of shifted tableaux. We show this formula can be used in conjunction with results of Hamaker, Marberg, and Pawlowski to obtain an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Pfaffian varieties known as vexillary skew-symmetric matrix Schubert varieties. Similar combinatorics additionally yields a new formula for the degree of Grassmannian Grothendieck polynomials and the regularity of Grassmannian matrix Schubert varieties, complementing a 2021 formula of Rajchgot, Ren, Robichaux, St. Dizier, and Weigandt.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for rainbow partial $F$-tiling in edge-colored complete hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an $r$-graph $F$ and integers $n,t$ satisfying $t \le n/v(F)$, let $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ denote the minimum integer $N$ such that every edge-coloring of $K_{n}^{r}$ using $N$ colors contains a rainbow copy of $tF$, where $tF$ is the $r$-graphs consisting of $t$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$. The case $t=1$ is the classical anti-Ramsey problem proposed by Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits--S\'{o}s~\cite{ESS75}. When $F$ is a single edge, this becomes the rainbow matching problem introduced by Schiermeyer~\cite{Sch04} and \"{O}zkahya--Young~\cite{OY13}. We conduct a systematic study of $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for the case where $t$ is much smaller than $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)/n^{r-1}$. Our first main result provides a reduction of $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ to $\mathrm{ar}(n,2F)$ when $F$ is bounded and smooth, two properties satisfied by most previously studied hypergraphs. Complementing the first result, the second main result, which utilizes gaps between Tur\'{a}n numbers, determines $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for relatively smaller $t$. Together, these two results determine $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for a large class of hypergraphs. Additionally, the latter result has the advantage of being applicable to hypergraphs with unknown Tur\'{a}n densities, such as the famous tetrahedron $K_{4}^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoregressive Neural Networks for Classical Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling and approximation of Boltzmann distributions involving large sets of binary variables, or spins, are pivotal in diverse scientific fields even beyond physics. Recent advances in generative neural networks have significantly impacted this domain. However, these neural networks are often treated as black boxes, with architectures primarily influenced by data-driven problems in computational science. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel autoregressive neural network architecture named TwoBo, specifically designed for sparse two-body interacting spin systems. We directly incorporate the Boltzmann distribution into its architecture and parameters, resulting in enhanced convergence speed, superior free energy accuracy, and reduced trainable parameters. We perform numerical experiments on disordered, frustrated systems with more than 1000 spins on grids and random graphs, and demonstrate its advantages compared to previous autoregressive and recurrent architectures. Our findings validate a physically informed approach and suggest potential extensions to multivalued variables and many-body interaction systems, paving the way for broader applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>The $\text{v}$-function of powers of sums of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16882</link>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, $I\subset R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $J\subset T=K[y_1,\dots,y_m]$ be graded ideals. Set $S=R\otimes_KT$ and let $L=IS+JS$. The behaviour of the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(L^k)$ in terms of the $\text{v}$-functions $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$ is investigated. When $I$ and $J$ are monomial ideals, we describe $\text{v}(L^k)$, giving an explicit formula involving $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-Resilient Trades for Dynamic Service Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A combinatorial trade is a pair of sets of blocks of elements that can be exchanged while preserving relevant subset intersection constraints. The class of balanced and swap-robust minimal trades was proposed in [1] for exchanging blocks of data chunks stored on distributed storage systems in an access- and load-balanced manner. More precisely, data chunks in the trades of interest are labeled by popularity ranks and the blocks are required to have both balanced overall popularity and stability properties with respect to swaps in chunk popularities. The original construction of such trades relied on computer search and paired balanced sets obtained through iterative combining of smaller sets that have provable stability guarantees. To reduce the substantial gap between the results of prior approaches and the known theoretical lower bound, we present new analytical upper and lower bounds on the minimal disbalance of blocks introduced by limited-magnitude popularity ranking swaps. Our constructive and near-optimal approach relies on pairs of graphs whose vertices are two balanced sets with edges/arcs that capture the balance and potential balance changes induced by limited-magnitude popularity swaps. In particular, we show that if we start with carefully selected balanced trades and limit the magnitude of rank swaps to one, the new upper and lower bound on the maximum block disbalance caused by a swap only differ by a factor of $1.07$. We also extend these results for larger popularity swap magnitudes.</description>
