      <title>Small-time asymptotics and the emergence of complex singularities for the KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While real-valued solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation have been studied extensively over the past 50 years, much less attention has been devoted to solution behaviour in the complex plane. Here we consider the analytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that complex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We apply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour for dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the amplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and location of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex plane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\rightarrow 0^+$, we show how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV equation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed as they move from their initial position is of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while the direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a Painlev\'{e} II (P$_{\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\'{e}e solutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational solutions of P$_{\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities; otherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV solutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We also provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which singularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes progress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions in the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution on the real line.</description>

      <title>Diagonal invariants and genus-zero Hurwitz Frobenius manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Frobenius manifold structure on the space of rational functions with multiple simple poles is constructed. In particular, the dependence of the Saito-flat coordinates on the flat coordinates of the intersection form is studied. While some of the individual flat coordinates are complicated rational functions, they appear in the prepotential in certain combinations known as diagonal invariants, which turn out to be polynomial. Two classes are studied in more detail. These are generalisations of the Coxeter and extended-affine-Weyl orbits space for the group $W=W(A_\ell)\,.$ An invariant theory is also developed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of turbulent mixing: discrete shell structures in scalar concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as a spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature and a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is the unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>
