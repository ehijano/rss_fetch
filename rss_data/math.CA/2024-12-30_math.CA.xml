      <title>On the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials on multiple intervals with non-analytic weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas--Its--Kitaev Riemann--Hilbert problem using the Deift--Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\overline \partial$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that are slightly improved while less regular perturbations are admissible. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be twice differentiable, with bounded third derivative.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for the generalised trigonometric integral and its zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the generalised trigonometric integral $\operatorname{ti}(a, z, \alpha)$ and its associated modulus and phase functions for large complex values of $z$. We derive asymptotic expansions for these functions, accompanied by explicit and computable error bounds. For real values of $a$, the function $\operatorname{ti}(a, z, \alpha)$ possesses infinitely many positive real zeros. Assuming $a &lt; 1$, we establish asymptotic expansions for the large zeros, accompanied by precise error estimates. The error bounds for the asymptotics of the phase function and its zeros will be derived by studying the analytic properties of both the phase function and its inverse. Additionally, we demonstrate that for real variables, the derived asymptotic expansions are enveloping, meaning that successive partial sums provide upper and lower bounds for the corresponding functions.</description>

      <title>The best approximation by trigonometric polynomials of classes of convolutions generated by some linear combinations of periodic kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For arbitrary nontrivial linear combinations of a finite number of Poisson kernels, the fulfillment of the Nagy condition is established for all numbers n, starting from some number. It is also proved for any n the existence of linear combinations of m Bernoulli kernels and linear combinations of m conjugate Poisson kernels that satisfy the Nikolsky condition and at the same time do not satisfy the Nagy condition.</description>

      <title>On the end-point of Stein-Weiss inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Stein-Weiss inequality of fractional integrals is true for p=q=1. Moreover, by considering a family of strong fractional integral operators whose kernels have singularity on every coordinate subspace, we extend this weighted L^1-result to a multi-parameter setting.</description>

      <title>Bicycle tracks with hyperbolic monodromy -- results and conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find new necessary and sufficient conditions for the bicycling monodromy of a closed plane curve to be hyperbolic. Our main tool is the ``hyperbolic development" interpretation of the bicycling monodromy of plane curves. Based on computer experiments, we pose two conjectures concerning the bicycling monodromy of strictly convex closed plane curves.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of decoding a translation invariant measure from a single set of positive Lebesgue measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a translation invariant measure on $(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ and let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. If there exists an open set $U$ such that $0&lt;\mu(U)=\lambda(U)&lt;\infty$, it is a simple exercise to show that $\mu=\lambda|_{\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)}$. Is the same conclusion true if $U$ is merely a Borel set?
  The main purpose of this short note is to construct a measure that provides a negative answer to this question. Incidentally, this construction provides a new example of a translation invariant measure with a rich domain and range that is not Hausdorff, a problem previously studied by Hirst.</description>

      <title>On Tiling and Spectral Sets in $\mathbb Z_{p^2}\times\mathbb Z_{p^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, it is shown that tiling and spectral sets coincide in $\mathbb Z_{p^2}\times\mathbb Z_{p^2}$ by considering equivalently symplectic spectral pairs. Symplectic structures appear naturally in time-frequency analysis and provides a perspective to reveal patterns that may not be so evident in the Euclidean setting. The main approach here is however still to count the size of the zero set and analyze its contents.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions for parabolic equations and systems: universal existence, uniqueness, representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>
