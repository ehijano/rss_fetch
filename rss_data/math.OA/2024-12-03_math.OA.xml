      <title>Norm upper-semicontinuity of functions supported on open abelian isotropy in \'etale groupoids (a corrigendum to "Reconstruction of groupoids and C*-rigidity of dynamical systems," Adv. Math 390 (2021), 107923)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider \'etale Hausdorff groupoids in which the interior of the isotropy is abelian. We prove that the norms of the images under regular representations, of elements of the reduced groupoid $C^*$-algebra whose supports are contained in the interior of the isotropy vary upper semicontinuously. This corrects an error in [T.M. Carlsen, E. Ruiz, A. Sims and M. Tomforde, "Reconstruction of groupoids and C*-rigidity of dynamical systems," Adv. Math 390 (2021), 107923].</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to spacetime bulk reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of holographic quantum error correction in the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, together with the kink transform conjecture on the bulk AdS description of boundary cocycle flow, we characterize (approximate) complementary recovery in terms of (approximate) intertwining of bulk and boundary cocycle derivatives. Using the geometric modular structure in vacuum AdS, we establish an operator algebraic subregion-subregion duality of boundary causal diamonds and bulk causal wedges for Klein-Gordon fields in the universal cover of AdS. Our results suggest that, from an algebraic perspective, the kink transform is bulk cocycle flow, which (in the above case) induces the bulk geometry via geometric modular action and the corresponding notion of time. As a by-product, we find that if the von Neumann algebra of a boundary CFT subregion is a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor with an ergodic vacuum, then the von Neumann algebra of the corresponding dual bulk subregion, is either $\mathbb{C}1$ (with a one-dimensional Hilbert space) or a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative integral on spectrally truncated spectral triples, and a link with quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple approximation of the noncommutative integral in noncommutative geometry for the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of spectrally truncated spectral triples. A close connection between this approximation and the field of quantum ergodicity and work by Widom in particular immediately provides a Szeg\H{o} limit formula for noncommutative geometry. Finally, we propose a definition for the ergodicity of geodesic flow for compact spectral triples. This definition is known in quantum ergodicity as uniqueness of the vacuum state for $C^*$-dynamical systems, and for spectral triples where local Weyl laws hold this implies that the Dirac operator of the spectral triple is quantum ergodic. This brings to light a close connection between quantum ergodicity and Connes' integral formula.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian ensembles GUE/GOE/GSE of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in three applications: we obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutation matrices; we obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture; and we prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a recent result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe all Gaussian generating functionals on several easy quantum groups given by non-crossing partitions. This includes in particular the free unitary, orthogonal and symplectic quantum groups. We further characterize central Gaussian generating functionals and describe a centralization procedure yielding interesting (non-Gaussian) generating functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define for families of finite metric spaces quantitative assembly map estimates that take into account propagation phenomena for pseudo-differential calculus. We relate these estimates to the Novikov conjecture and we show that they fit nicely under coarse decompositions. As an application, we provide a geometric proof of Novikov conjecture for groups with finite decomposition complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.10767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unified treatment of several results concerning full groups of ample groupoids and paradoxical decompositions attached to them. This includes a criterion for the full group of an ample groupoid being amenable as well as comparison of its orbit, Koopman and groupoid-left-regular representations. Besides that, we unify several recent results about paradoxicality in semigroups and groupoids, relating embeddings of Thompson's group V into full groups of ample \'etale groupoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we state a conjecture that characterizes unital C*-algebras for which the unitary group is amenable as a topological group in the norm topology. We prove the conjecture for simple, separable, stably finite, unital, $\mathcal Z$-stable, UCT C*-algebras with torsionfree K_0 using the progress on the Elliott classification program for nuclear C*-algebras as well as Pestov's study of amenability of gauge groups. Based on work of Kirchberg, we provide a counterexample to a question of Ng, who proposed a different characterization in earlier work.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Nica-Pimsner quotients associated with strong compactly aligned product systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We parametrise the gauge-invariant ideals of the Toeplitz-Nica-Pimsner algebra of a strong compactly aligned product system over $\mathbb{Z}_+^d$ by using $2^d$-tuples of ideals of the coefficient algebra that are invariant, partially ordered, and maximal. We give an algebraic characterisation of maximality that allows the iteration of a $2^d$-tuple to the maximal one inducing the same gauge-invariant ideal. The parametrisation respects inclusions and intersections, while we characterise the join operation on the $2^d$-tuples that renders the parametrisation a lattice isomorphism.
  The problem of the parametrisation of the gauge-invariant ideals is equivalent to the study of relative Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebras, for which we provide a generalised Gauge-Invariant Uniqueness Theorem. We focus further on equivariant quotients of the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebra and provide applications to regular product systems, C*-dynamical systems, strong finitely aligned higher-rank graphs, and product systems on finite frames. In particular, we provide a description of the parametrisation for (possibly non-automorphic) C*-dynamical systems and row-finite higher-rank graphs, which squares with known results when restricting to crossed products and to locally convex row-finite higher-rank graphs.</description>

      <title>CP$^{\infty}$ and beyond: 2-categorical dilation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of extending the insights and techniques of categorical quantum mechanics to infinite-dimensional systems was considered in (Coecke and Heunen, 2016). In that work the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, which recovers the category of Hilbert spaces and quantum operations from the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, was defined. Here we show that by a `horizontal categorification' of the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, one can recover the category of all von Neumann algebras and channels (normal unital completely positive maps) from the 2-category $[W^*]$ of von Neumann algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. As an application, we extend Choi's characterisation of extremal channels between finite-dimensional matrix algebras to a characterisation of extremal channels between arbitrary von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a unified overview of the study of the effects of additional set theoretic axioms on quotient structures. Our focus is on rigidity, measured in terms of existence (or rather non-existence) of suitably \emph{non-trivial} automorphisms of the quotients in question. A textbook example for the study of this topic is the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/Fin$, whose behavior is the template around which this survey revolves: Forcing axioms imply that all of its automorphisms are \emph{trivial}, in the sense that they are induced by almost permutations of $\mathbb N$, while under the Continuum Hypothesis this rigidity fails and $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/Fin$ admits uncountably many non-trivial automorphisms. We consider far-reaching generalizations of this phenomenon and present a wide variety of situations where analogous patterns persist, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on the categories of Boolean algebras, \v Cech--Stone remainders, and $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We survey the state of the art and the future prospects of this field, discussing the major open problems and outlining the main ideas of the proofs whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Multiplier algebras of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the multiplier algebra of an approximately unital and nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra is again an $L^p$-operator algebra. In this paper we investigate examples that drop both hypotheses. In particular, we show that the multiplier algebra of $T_2^p$, the algebra of strictly upper triangular $2 \times 2$ matrices acting on $\ell_2^p$, is still an $L^p$-operator algebra for any $p$. To contrast this result, we first provide a thorough study of the augmentation ideal of $\ell^1(G)$ for a discrete group $G$. We use this ideal to define a family of nonapproximately unital degenerate $L^p$-operator algebras, $F_{0}^p(\Bbb{Z}/3\Bbb{Z})$, whose multiplier algebras cannot be represented on any $L^q$-space for any $q \in [1, \infty)$ as long as $p \in [1, p_0] \cup [p_0', \infty)$, where $p_0=1.606$ and $p_0'$ is its H\"older conjugate.</description>
