      <title>Nonlinear Ion-Acoustic Waves with Landau Damping in Non-Maxwellian Space Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in the presence of kinetic (Landau type) damping have been investigated in a collisionless, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. A cold ion fluid model, coupled to a Vlasov-type kinetic equation for the electron dynamics, has been adopted as a starting point. The electron population was assumed to be in a kappa-distributed state, in account of the non-Maxwellian behavior of energetic (suprathermal) electrons often observed in Space. A multiscale perturbation technique has led to an evolution equation for the electrostatic potential, in the form of a modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, incorporating a non-local term accounting for Landau damping (associated with the electron statistics). Exact analytical solutions have been obtained, representing solitary waves undergoing amplitude decay over time. The combined effect of Landau damping and non-Maxwellian electron statistics (via the kappa parameter) on the characteristics of IASWs has been examined. Numerical integration of the evolution equation has been undertaken, to elucidate the importance of kinetic Landau damping on a shock-shaped initial condition. The results of this investigation aim to improve our understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear electrostatic waves under the influence of Landau damping in various space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal synchronization of active quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent may attract another one, which in turn is repelled. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. We show that nonreciprocal interactions deeply affect their synchronization dynamics. In the thermodynamic limit, this results in a nonreciprocal phase transition to nonstationary traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, we discuss how traveling-wave states and nonreciprocal phase transitions are revealed by spin correlations measurable via the output field of the waveguides. Our work opens a new avenue to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>
