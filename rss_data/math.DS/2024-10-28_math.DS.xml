      <title>Intersections of Cantor Sets Derived from Complex Radix Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be the attractor of the IFS $\{f_{d}(z) = (-n+i)^{-1}(z+d): d\in D\}$, $D\subset\{0, 1, \ldots, n^{2}\}$ and let $\dim$ denote the box-counting dimension. It is known that for all $\lambda\in[0, 1]$, that the set of complex numbers $\alpha$ for which $\dim(C\cap(C+\alpha)) = \lambda\dim(C)$ is dense in the set of $\alpha$ for which $C \cap (C + \alpha) \neq \emptyset$ when $d \leq n^{2}/2$ for all $d\in D$ and $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ for all $\delta \neq \delta^{'} \in D - D$. We show that this result still holds when we replace $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ with $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; 1$. In fact, for sufficiently large $n$, the result even holds when we remove the assumption $d\leq n^{2}/2$ and replace $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; n$ by $|\delta - \delta^{'}| &gt; 2$. Additionally, we make similar statements where $\dim$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension or packing dimension. Our insights also find application in classifying the self-similarity of $C\cap(C+\alpha)$. Namely we connect the occurrence of self-similarity to the notion of strongly eventually periodic sequences seen for analogous objects on the real line. We also provide a new proof of a result of W. Gilbert that inspired this work.</description>

      <title>Galton-Watson processes in dynamical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a model of Galton Watson processes in dynamical environments where the environment evolves according to a dynamical system (X, T). Three behaviours are possible: uniformly subcritical, critical, and uniformly supercritical. We study the extinction probability q in the uniformly supercritical case. In particular, we investigate the regularity of this application as a function of the environment x. In the critical case, we study the set of bad environments N (where the probability of extinction is one), which is T -invariant. We give its Hausdorff dimension in some cases.</description>

      <title>Tangents and slices of self-affine carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fine scaling properties of planar self-affine carpets. For Gatzouras--Lalley carpets, we give a precise formula for maximal Hausdorff dimension of a tangent in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the projection and the Assouad dimension of the corresponding vertical slice. Using regularity properties for the Assouad dimension of non-autonomous self-similar sets, this implies that the set of points with tangents that are as large as possible has full Hausdorff measure, at the critical exponent. On the other hand, we give an explicit example of a Bara\'nski carpet for which the Hausdorff dimension of the set of points for which there exists a maximal tangent has Hausdorff dimension strictly less than the Hausdorff dimension of the original carpet.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of $\alpha \beta$-sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Feng-Xiong lower bound of $1/2$ for the box dimension of $\alpha\beta$-sets is tight. We also study how much of an $\alpha\beta$-orbit ``carries the dimension'': deleting an arbitararily small positive density set of times can cause the box dimension to drop to zero, but the Assouad dimension cannot drop below $1/4$.</description>

      <title>New results on embeddings of self-similar sets via renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For self-similar sets $X,Y\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we obtain new results towards the affine embeddings conjecture of Feng-Huang-Rao (2014), and the equivalent weak intersections conjecture. We show that the conjecture holds when the defining maps of $X,Y$ have algebraic contraction ratios, and also for arbitrary $Y$ when the maps defining $X$ have algebraic-contraction ratios and there are sufficiently many of them relative to the number of maps defining $Y$. We also show that it holds for a.e. choice of the corresponding contraction ratios, and obtain bounds on the packing dimension of the exceptional parameters. Key ingredients in our argument include a new renormalization procedure in the space of embeddings, and Orponen's projection Theorem for Assouad dimension (2021).</description>

      <title>Entropies and Poisson boundaries of random walks on groups with rapid decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group and $\mu$ a probability measure on $G$. We build a new framework to compute asymptotic quantities associated with the $\mu$-random walk on $G$, using methods from harmonic analysis on groups and Banach space theory, most notably the complex interpolation. It is shown that under mild conditions, the Lyapunov exponent of the $\mu$-random walk with respect to a weight $\omega$ on $G$ can be computed in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the spectral radius of $\mu$ in an ascending class of weighted group algebras, and we prove that for natural choices of $\omega$ and $\mu$, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. Also, we show that the Avez entropy of the $\mu$-random walk can be realized as the Lyapunov exponent of $\mu$ with respect to a suitable weight.
  Next, by considering the spectral radius in the algebras of $p$-pseudofunctions on $G$, we introduce a new asymptotic quantity, which we call convolution entropy. We show that for groups with the property of rapid decay, the convolution entropy coincides with the Avez entropy. Subsequently, we apply our results to stationary dynamical systems consisting of an action of a group with the property of rapid decay on a \hyphenation{pro-ba-bi-li-ty}probability space. We prove that whenever the associated Koopman representation is weakly contained in the left-regular representation of the group, then the Avez entropy coincides with the Furstenberg entropy of the stationary space. This gives a characterization of (Zimmer) amenability for actions of rapid decay groups on stationary spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop Pesin theory for the boundary map of some Fatou components of transcendental functions, under certain hyptothesis on the singular values and the Lyapunov exponent. That is, we prove that generic inverse branches for such maps are well-defined and conformal. In particular, we study in depth the Lyapunov exponents with respect to harmonic measure, providing results which are of independent interest. As an application of our results, we describe in detail generic inverse branches for centered inner functions, and we prove density of periodic boundary points for a large class of Fatou components. Our proofs use techniques from measure theory, ergodic theory, conformal analysis, and inner functions, as well as estimates on harmonic measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundaries of non-univalent simply connected Baker domains of transcendental maps (both entire and meromorphic), of hyperbolic and simply parabolic type. We prove non-ergodicity and non-recurrence for the boundary map, and additional properties concerning the Julia set and the set of singularities of the associated inner function, and the topology and the dynamics on the boundary of the Baker domain. In particular, we prove the existence of points on the boundary whose orbit does not converge to infinity through the dynamical access, in the sense of Carath\'eodory. Finally, under mild conditions on the postsingular set, we prove the existence of periodic points on the boundary of such Baker domains.</description>

      <title>Negative regularity mixing for random volume preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the negative regularity mixing properties of random volume preserving diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold without boundary. We give general criteria so that the associated random transfer operator mixes $H^{-\delta}$ observables exponentially fast in $H^{-\delta}$ (with a deterministic rate), a property that is false in the deterministic setting. The criteria apply to a wide variety of random diffeomorphisms, such as discrete-time iid random diffeomorphisms, the solution maps of suitable classes of stochastic differential equations, and to the case of advection-diffusion by solutions of the stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb T^2$. In the latter case, we show that the zero diffusivity passive scalar with a stochastic source possesses a unique stationary measure describing "ideal" scalar turbulence. The proof is based on techniques inspired by the use of pseudodifferential operators and anisotropic Sobolev spaces in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a way of analyzing the random dynamics of stochastic evolution equations with a non-dense domain. Such problems cover several types of evolution equations. We are particularly interested in evolution equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions of white noise type. We prove the existence of stable, unstable, and center manifolds around a stationary trajectory by combining integrated semigroup theory and invariant manifold theory. The results are applied to stochastic parabolic equations with white noise at the boundary.</description>

      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>

      <title>H\'enon maps with biholomorphic Kato surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be generalized H\'enon maps. We show that the Kato surfaces associated to the germs of $F$ and $G$ near infinity are biholomorphic if and only if $F$ and $G$ are conjugate in $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{C}^2)$. This answers a question raised by Favre in X\'enelkis de H\'enon's survey.
  We also show that two generalized H\'enon maps are conjugate near infinity, if and only if they are affinely conjugate.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of a Zariski dense discrete non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the associated quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. In fact, let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold with properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane for $n\ge 3$. We prove that there exists a non-empty open subset $\cal O$ of $\rm{Hom}(\Gamma, \rm{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the image $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$. Moreover the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal, that is, it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators of all non-lattice discrete subgroups given by property $(T)$ of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann-Grad Limit of the Lorentz Gas in a Union of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorentz gas describes an ensemble of noninteracting point particles in an infinite array of spherical scatterers. In the present paper we consider the case when the scatterer configuration P is a fixed union of (translated) lattices in R^d, and prove that in the limit of low scatterer density, the particle dynamics converges to a random flight process. In the special case when the lattices in P are pairwise incommensurable, this settles a conjecture from [20]. The proof is carried out by applying a framework developed in recent work by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson [21], and central parts of our proof are the construction of an admissible marking of the point set P, and the verification of the uniform spherical equidistribution condition required in [21]. Regarding the random flight process obtained in the low density limit of the Lorentz gas, we prove that it can be reconstructed from the corresponding limiting flight processes arising from the individual commensurability classes of lattices in P. We furthermore prove that the free path lengths of the limit flight process have a distribution with a power law tail, whose exponent depends on the number of commensurability classes in P.</description>

      <title>Global stability and optimal control in a single-strain dengue model with fractional-order transmission and recovery process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current manuscript introduce a single-strain dengue model developed from stochastic processes incorporating fractional order transmission and recovery. The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ($TF$) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's $TF$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number (R_0). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number (R_0) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to asses the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reduction the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vector, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that, policymakers should place importance on the fractional order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underline mechanisms of disease along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of two vector controls.</description>

      <title>A logarithm law for nonautonomous systems fastly converging to equilibrium and mean field coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a nonautonomous system has in a certain sense a fast convergence to equilibrium (faster than any power law behavior) then the time $\tau _{r}(x,y)$ needed for a typical point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B(y,r)$ centered in $y$, with small radius \ $r $ scales as the local dimension of the equilibrium measure \ $\mu $ at $y$, i.e. $$ \underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim }\frac{\log \tau _{r}(x,y)}{-\log r}% =d_{\mu }(y).$$
  We then apply the general result to concrete systems of different kind, showing such a logarithm law for asymptotically authonomous solenoidal maps and mean field coupled expanding maps.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits for square and rectangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical billiards is much like the real game: a point mass, representing the ball, rolls in a straight line on a (perfectly friction-less) table, striking the sides according to the law of reflection. A billiard trajectory is then completely characterised by the number of elastic collisions. The rules of mathematical billiards may be simple, but the possible behaviours of billiard trajectories are endless. In fact, several fundamental theory questions in mathematics can be recast as billiards problems. A billiard trajectory is called a periodic orbit if the number of distinct collisions in the trajectory is finite. We classify all possible periodic orbits on square and rectangular tables. We show that periodic orbits on such billiard tables cannot have an odd number of distinct collisions. We also present a connection between the number of different classes of periodic orbits and Euler's totient function, which for any integer $N$ counts how many integers smaller than $N$ share no common divisor with $N$ other than $1$. We explore how to construct periodic orbits with a prescribed (even) number of distinct collisions, and investigate properties of inadmissible (singular) trajectories, which are trajectories that eventually terminate at a vertex (a table corner).</description>

      <title>Classifying Hyperbolic Ergodic Stationary Measures on Compact Complex Surfaces with Large Automorphism Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact complex surface. Consider a finitely supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\text{Aut}(X)$ such that $\Gamma_{\mu} = \langle \text{Supp}(\mu)\rangle&lt;\text{Aut}(X)$ is non-elementary. We do not assume that $\Gamma_{\mu}$ contains any parabolic elements. In this paper, we study and classify hyperbolic, ergodic $\mu$-stationary probability measures.</description>

      <title>Towards the boundary of the fine curve graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fine curve graph was introduced as a geometric tool to study homeomorphisms of surfaces. In this paper we study the Gromov boundary of this space and the local topology near points associated with certain foliations and laminations. We then give several applications including finding dynamically explicit elements with positive stable commutator length, and proving a Tits alternative for subgroups of $\textrm{Homeo}(S)$ containing a pseudo-Anosov map, generalizing a result of Hurtado-Xue.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Birkhoff attractors (with an appendix by Maxime Zavidovique)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend to higher dimensions the notion of Birkhoff attractor of a dissipative map. We prove that this notion coincides with the classical Birkhoff attractor. We prove that for the dissipative system associated to the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation the graph of a solution is contained in the Birkhoff attractor. We also study what happens when we perturb a Hamiltonian system to make it dissipative and let the perturbation go to zero. The paper contains two important results on $\gamma$-supports and elements of the $\gamma$-completion of the space of exact Lagrangians. Firstly the $\gamma$-support of a Lagrangian in a cotangent bundle carries the cohomology of the base and secondly given an exact Lagrangian $L$, any Floer theoretic equivalent Lagrangian is the $\gamma$-limit of Hamiltonian images of $L$. The appendix provides instructive counter-examples.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability of cells for the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>
