      <title>Reservoir Static Property Estimation Using Nearest-Neighbor Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents an approach for estimating the spatial distribution of static properties in reservoir modeling using a nearest-neighbor neural network. The method leverages the strengths of neural networks in approximating complex, non-linear functions, particularly for tasks involving spatial interpolation. It incorporates a nearest-neighbor algorithm to capture local spatial relationships between data points and introduces randomization to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the interpolation process. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional geostatistical methods, such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Kriging, which often fail to model the complex non-linear dependencies in reservoir data. By integrating spatial proximity and uncertainty quantification, the proposed method can improve the accuracy of static property predictions like porosity and permeability.</description>

      <title>Texture Discrimination via Hilbert Curve Path Based Information Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the spatial arrangement of colors and roughness/smoothness of figures is relevant due to its wide range of applications. This paper proposes a texture classification method that extracts data from images using the Hilbert curve. Three information theory quantifiers are then computed: permutation entropy, permutation complexity, and Fisher information measure. The proposal exhibits some important properties: (i) it allows to discriminate figures according to varying degrees of correlations (as measured by the Hurst exponent), (ii) it is invariant to rotation and symmetry transformations, (iii) it can be used either in black and white or color images. Validations have been made not only using synthetic images but also using the well-known Brodatz image database.</description>

      <title>Predictability Analysis and Prediction of Discrete Weather and Financial Time-Series Data with a Hamiltonian-Based Filter-Projection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation (GLE), derived by projection from a general many-body Hamiltonian, exactly describes the dynamics of an arbitrary coarse-grained variable in a complex environment. However, analysis and prediction of real-world data with the GLE is hampered by slow transient or seasonal data components and time-discretization effects. Machine-learning (ML) techniques work but are computer-resource demanding and difficult to interpret. We show that by convolution filtering, time-series data decompose into fast, transient and seasonal components that each obey Hamiltonian dynamics and, thus, can be separately analyzed by projection techniques. We introduce methods to extract all GLE parameters from highly discretized time-series data and to forecast future data including the environmental stochasticity. For daily-resolved weather data, our analysis reveals non-Markovian memory that decays over a few days. Our prediction accuracy is comparable to commercial (weather.com) and ML long short-term memory (LSTM) methods at a reduced computational cost by a factor of $10^2-10^3$ compared to LSTM. For financial data, memory is very short-ranged and the dynamics effectively is Markovian, in agreement with the efficient-market hypothesis; consequently, models simpler than the GLE are sufficient. Our GLE framework is an efficient and interpretable method for the analysis and prediction of complex time-series data.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Instrument for Measuring Soft Material Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft material research has seen significant growth in recent years, with emerging applications in robotics, electronics, and healthcare diagnostics where understanding material mechanical response is crucial for precision design. Traditional methods for measuring nonlinear mechanical properties of soft materials require specially sized samples that are extracted from their natural environment to be mounted on the testing instrument. This has been shown to compromise data accuracy and precision in various soft and biological materials. To overcome this, the Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE) method was developed. This technique tests soft materials by controlling the formation rate of a liquid cavity inside the materials at the tip of an injection needle, and simultaneously measuring the resisting pressure which describes the material response. Despite VCCE's early successes, expansion of its application beyond academia has been hindered by cost, size, and expertise. In response to this, the first portable, bench-top instrument utilizing VCCE is presented here. This device, built with affordable, readily available components and open-source software, streamlines VCCE experimentation without sacrificing performance or precision. It is especially suitable for space-limited settings and designed for use by non-experts, promoting widespread adoption. The instrument's efficacy was demonstrated through testing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples of varying stiffness. This study not only validates instrument performance, but also sets the stage for further advancements and broader applications in soft material testing. All data, along with acquisition, control, and post-processing scripts, are made available on GitHub.</description>
