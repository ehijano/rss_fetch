      <title>Spectroscopic and Photometric Investigation of Some Potentially Chemically Peculiar $\delta$ Scuti Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating chemically peculiar pulsating stars is crucial for understanding the pulsation driving mechanism in detail. To reveal the true peculiarity properties of stars detailed spectroscopic analysis is essential. Therefore, in this study, we focused on Delta Scuti stars previously identified as chemically peculiar but needed comprehensive updated spectroscopic analysis to uncover the chemical abundance structure of them. We selected ten targets which have public high-resolution spectroscopic and photometric data. Performing spectral analyses, we determined the spectral classification, atmospheric parameters, and detailed chemical abundance distributions of the selected stars. The pulsation properties were also analyzed using TESS data and pulsation modes for the highest amplitude pulsation frequencies were derived. We estimated the masses and ages of the targets using the evolutionary tracks and isochrones. As a result of the study, we show that only three targets exhibit chemical peculiarity: AU Scl and FG Eri as metallic A (Am) stars, and HZ Vel as a $\lambda$ Bootis. However, others were found to be chemically normal stars. This study show us the importance of chemical abundance analysis in the classification of chemical peculiar stars.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Corrected White Dwarf Gravitational Redshifts Validate SDSS-V Wavelength Calibration and Enable Accurate Mass-Radius Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5-15 km/s) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass-radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass-radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.</description>

      <title>North-South Asymmetry of the Solar Activity at Different Spatial Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity seems quite understandable when considered on the scales comparable with a solar cycle, i.e. about 11 years, and on a short time scale of about a year. A solar cycle looks basically (anti)symmetric with respect to the solar equator, while the sunspot distribution is more or less random. We investigated the difference in the spatial distribution of magnetic structures on both time scales in terms of sunspots and the surface large-scale magnetic field and arrived at the conclusion that the structures of each type are created by a specific mechanism. For long-term structures, it is the mean-field dynamo. For the short-term ones, it is the spot production considered as a separate physical mechanism. The relationship between the mean-field dynamo mechanism and the processes of sunspot formation is a complex problem of current interest. The 11-year cycle itself is created by the mean-field dynamo and is most likely determined by processes in the convection zone. However, the transformation of magnetic flux into spots and active regions occurs, apparently, on significantly shorter time scales and probably develops directly in the subsurface layers, i.e., Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL) or leptocline.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Cha H{\alpha} 1, a brown dwarf with a hydrocarbon-rich disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent JWST observations have shown that brown dwarfs (BD) are chemically rich, offering valuable insights into giant planet formation. Aims. As part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) JWST guaranteed time program, we aim to characterize the gas and dust composition of the disk around the brown dwarf [NC98] Cha HA 1, hereafter Cha H$\alpha$ 1, in the mid-infrared. Methods. We obtain data from the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 28$\mu$m. We use the dust fitting tool DuCK to investigate the dust composition and grain sizes while we identify and fit molecular emission using slab models. Results. Compared with disks around very low mass stars, clear silicate emission features are seen in this BD disk. In addition, JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and C$_6$H$_6$ which suggest a disk with a gas C/O &gt; 1. Additionally, we detect CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, HCN, H$_2$, and H$_2$O. CO and OH are absent from the spectrum. The dust is dominated by large $\sim$4 $\mu$m size amorphous silicates (MgSiO$_3$). We infer a small dust mass fraction ($&gt;$10$\%$) of 5 $\mu$m size crystalline forsterite. We do not detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Conclusions. Cha H$\alpha$ 1 shows the most diverse chemistry seen to date in a BD protoplanetary disk, consisting of a strong dust feature, 12 carbon-bearing molecules plus H$_2$, and water. The diverse molecular environment offers a unique opportunity to test our understanding of BD disks chemistry and how it affects the possible planets forming in them.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A plasmoid-model for mass loss from stars on the upper red giant branch: The mass loss rate is controlled by the number of density scale heights in the convection zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent asteroseismic determinations of {\Delta}M, the integrated mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB), for fields stars show a trend of {\Delta}M decreasing as metallicity increases. This trend among field stars is inconsistent with many existing models of RGB mass loss. The present paper is motivated by a 'plasmoid' model of RGB mass loss in which magnetic flux loops, generated by a shear dynamo operating below the convection zone, are buoyed up to the stellar surface starting at the evolutionary stage right after the RGB 'kink'. This model leads us to examine correlations between, on the one hand, the average post-kink RGB mass loss rate, determined from {\Delta}M and the post-kink RGB lifetime, and on the other hand, stellar properties which exist just after the end of the kink. For three distinct stellar samples, we find strong anti-correlations between the average post-kink RGB mass loss rate and the number of density scale heights in the convection zone. This leads us to propose that the number of density scale heights in the convection zone is a dominant factor in determining the rate of the mass loss process which sets in after the RGB kink.</description>

      <title>Clustering Wind data at 1 AU to contextualize magnetic reconnection in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magnetic reconnection events are frequently observed in the solar wind. Understanding the patterns and structures within the solar wind is crucial to put observed magnetic reconnection events into context, since their occurrence rate and properties are likely influenced by solar wind conditions.
  Aims. We employed unsupervised learning techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM) and K-Means to cluster and interpret solar wind data at 1 AU for an improved understanding of the conditions that lead to magnetic reconnection in the solar wind.
  Methods. We collected magnetic field data and proton density, proton temperature, and solar wind speed measurements taken by the Wind spacecraft. After preprocessing the data, we trained a SOM to visualize the high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space and applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct clusters within the solar wind data.
  Results. Our analysis revealed that the reconnection events are distributed across five different clusters: a) slow solar wind, b) compressed slow wind, c) highly Alfv\'enic wind, d) compressed fast wind, and e) ejecta. Compressed slow and fast wind and ejecta are clusters associated with solar wind transients such as stream interaction regions and interplanetary coronal mass ejections. The majority of the reconnection events are associated with the slow solar wind, followed by the highly Alfv\'enic wind, compressed slow wind, and compressed fast wind, and a small fraction of the reconnection events are associated with ejecta.
  Conclusions. Unsupervised learning approaches with SOM and K-Means lead to physically interpretable solar wind clusters based on their transients and allow for the contextualization of magnetic reconnection exhausts' occurrence in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Nascent chemical complexity in prestellar core IRAS 16293E: complex organics and deuterated methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prestellar cores represent early sites of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) star and planet formation and provide insight into initial chemical conditions of complex organic molecules (COMs). Deuterated COMs trace the degree of molecular inheritance and/or reprocessing, as high deuteration in protostellar systems suggests COMs forming during the prestellar stage when deuteration is enhanced. Within the L1689N molecular cloud, the prestellar core IRAS 16293E sits $90^{"}$ eastward of the chemically-rich IRAS 16293-2422 A and B protostellar system. A unique view of star formation inside a common natal cloud, IRAS 16293A, B, and E all show some of the highest levels of deuteration in the ISM, with a number of D/H ratios $10^{5}$ times higher than Solar. We investigate for the first time the deuteration levels of the simplest COM, methanol (CH$_3$OH), in IRAS 16293E. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope, we target favorable transitions of CH$_2$DOH, CHD$_2$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and several higher complexity COMs (including acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the 3 mm band. Follow-up observations with the Yebes 40 m telescope provided additional transitions in the 7 mm (Q-band). We report the first detections of these COMs and deuterated methanol in prestellar core IRAS 16293E and use our observations to calculate excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundance ratios. Striking similarities are found between relative molecular ratios and D/H values when comparing IRAS 16293E to the A and B protostars, as well as to a heterogeneous sample of other prestellar cores, protostars, and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our results support the idea that there is a limited amount of chemical reprocessing of COMs when prestellar cores collapse and heat-up during the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>Flares on TRAPPIST-1 reveal the spectrum of magnetic features on its surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 is an M8 dwarf hosting seven known exoplanets and is currently one of the most frequently observed targets of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, it is notoriously active, and its surface is believed to be covered by magnetic features that contaminate the planetary transmission spectra. The radiative spectra of these magnetic features are needed to clean transmission spectra, but they currently remain unknown. Here, we develop a new approach for measuring these spectra using time-resolved JWST/NIRISS observations. We detect a persistent post-flare enhancement in the spectral flux of TRAPPIST-1. Our analysis rules out lingering flare decay as the cause of the flux enhancement and, thus, points to structural changes on the stellar surface induced by flares. We suggest that the flaring event triggers the disappearance of (part of) a dark magnetic feature, producing a net brightening. This suggestion is motivated by solar data: flare-induced disappearance of magnetic features on the solar surface has been directly detected in high spatial resolution images, and our analysis shows that this process produces changes in solar brightness very similar to those we observe on TRAPPIST-1. The proposed explanation for the flux enhancement enables, to our knowledge, the first measurement of the spectrum of a magnetic feature on an M8 dwarf. Our analysis indicates that the disappearing magnetic feature is cooler than the TRAPPIST-1 photosphere, but by at most a few hundred kelvins.</description>

      <title>A semi-coherent search for optical pulsations from Scorpius X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of semi-coherent strategies in the search for optical pulsations from binary systems, which resulted in the tightest constraints on pulsations from Sco X-1. We analysed observations from the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the TNG spread across four years, for a total of $\sim$56 ks divided in two datasets. The great efficiency of semi-coherent techniques when only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available allowed us to set an upper limit at $9.23 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in pulsed amplitude for this source, improving on previous results by a factor of 4. Reaching the same upper limit with fully coherent searches would have required a number of trials more than two orders of magnitude larger. We also applied the same algorithm to an optical observation of a system containing a known pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, ignoring the refined knowledge of the orbital parameters that was allowed by the identification of the pulsar itself in the radio band: through this analysis, we proved that detection of the pulsar would have followed even with data in the optical band alone.</description>

      <title>Probing Dust and PAH Chemistry in Evolved Carbon-Rich Nebulae through Optical and Infrared Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents optical and near-infrared photometric observations, alongside mid-infrared spectroscopic data from the ISO SWS instrument, to examine potential correlations between Aromatic Infrared Band (AIB) features and the optical properties of carbon-rich evolved stars. Identifying such correlations can provide valuable constraints on the evolutionary pathways of low- to intermediate-mass stars beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Photometric measurements in the U, B, V, R, I, J, H, K, and L bands were obtained for five well-known carbon-rich objects at various post-AGB or planetary nebula (PN) stages: CRL 2688, PN M 2-43, NGC 7027, BD${+}$30${^\circ}$3639, and AFGL 2132. Our analysis reveals that all five objects exhibit prominent AIB features; however, their spectral profiles show notable variation. These differences are attributed to variations in the chemical composition and physical conditions of the surrounding circumstellar material. In particular, the 3.28$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature is detected in all objects except AFGL 2132, indicating a potentially distinct PAH population or environmental condition in its vicinity. Although these sources share broadly similar evolutionary stages, the observed diversity in AIB characteristics underscores the complexity and heterogeneity of their circumstellar environments.</description>

Surveys for very low-mass companions to M-A type stars detect brown dwarfs from multiple star formation and planets from circumstellar disks. We fit a composite model describing both very low-mass brown dwarf companions from "multiple-like processes" and gas giants from "planet-like processes" as functions of orbital separation and host star mass. We assemble a database of companion frequency estimates for masses from $&lt; 1$ to $&gt; 75$ Jupiter masses, separations from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 300$ AU, and host masses from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 2 M_{\odot}$. Using multinest, we fit these data to various models, performing model selection and deriving probability density functions. We assume companion mass ratio distributions are independent of orbital separation and fit a common log-normal orbital distribution to gas giant populations around M dwarfs, FGK, and A stars. A six-parameter model based on companion mass ratio distributions for planets and brown dwarfs is preferred. The planet CMRD slope is consistent with previous studies ($dN/dq \sim q^{-1.3} \pm 0.03$). Gas giant planets around stars from $&lt; 0.3$ to $&gt; 2.0 M_{\odot}$ follow a log-normal distribution peaking at ln(a) = 1.30 $\pm$ 0.03 (3.8 AU) with dispersion 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04. M dwarf distributions peak at smaller orbital radii than A stars, consistent with iceline considerations. Brown dwarf companion distributions extend stellar binary patterns, with the brown dwarf desert explained by flat-in-q mass functions and limited mass ratios below 0.1.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, particularly those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description>

      <title>DAWN. I. Simulating the formation and early evolution of stellar clusters with Phantom N-Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.</description>

      <title>Long-period variable stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185-II. Their dust production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of mass-loss and dust-production rates in the dwarf galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185, focusing on long-period variables (LPVs) and pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars as primary indicators of dust feedback into the interstellar medium. For NGC 147, the total mass-loss rate is calculated as $(9.44 \pm 3.78) \times 10^{-4} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities ranging from $(6.20 \pm 0.25) \times 10^{2} L_\odot$ to $( 7.87 \pm 0.32) \times 10^{3} L_\odot $. In NGC 185, the total mass-loss rate is higher, at $(1.58 \pm 0.63) \times 10^{-3} M_{sun} yr^{-1}$, with LPV luminosities spanning $ (5.68 \pm 0.23) \times 10^{2} L_\odot $ to $(1.54 \pm 0.66) \times 10^{4} L_\odot$. A positive correlation is observed between stellar luminosity, intrinsic reddening due to circumstellar dust self-extinction, and elevated mass-loss rates. Additionally, comparisons of calculated dust injection rates, two-dimensional dust distribution maps, and observed dust masses provide evidence for a gravitational interaction between NGC 147 and the Andromeda galaxy, which influences the dust distribution within the system.</description>

      <title>Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) for heliospheric imager data</title>

Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing significant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The timely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards implementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are commonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some forecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images in order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process is time-consuming and results may exhibiting considerable interpersonal variation.
  We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments aboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through interplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution. Building on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to automatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the challenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a range of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a basic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames, thus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles.
  Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation techniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and interacting CMEs.</description>

      <title>The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture, with Possible Application to Chondrites and Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000{\AA} reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [OI]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.</description>
