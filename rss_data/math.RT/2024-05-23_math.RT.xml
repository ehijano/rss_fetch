      <title>Block decompositions for $p$-adic classical groups and their inner forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an inner form $\mathrm{G}$ of a general linear group or classical group over a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, we decompose the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\mu_{p^{\infty}},1/p]$-modules by endo-parameter. We prove that parabolic induction preserves these decompositions, and hence that it preserves endo-parameters. Moreover, we show that the decomposition by endo-parameter is the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[1/p]$-block decomposition; and, for $\mathrm{R}$ an integral domain, introduce a graph whose connected components parameterize the $\mathrm{R}$-blocks, in particular including the cases $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}$ and $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ for $\ell\neq p$. From our description, we deduce that the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_\ell}$-blocks and $\overline{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$-blocks of $\mathrm{G}$ are in natural bijection, as had long been expected. Our methods also apply to the trivial endo-parameter (i.e., the depth zero subcategory) of any connected reductive $p$-adic group, providing an alternative approach to results of Dat and Lanard in depth zero. Finally, under a technical assumption (known for inner forms of general linear groups) we reduce the $\mathrm{R}$-block decomposition of $\mathrm{G}$ to depth zero.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Result for Dimensions of Irreducible Representations of Smooth Affine Group Schemes Over Principal Ideal Local Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathfrak{o}$ the valuation ring of a non-Archimedean local field with prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ and finite residue field, and let $r\geq 1$ be an integer. We prove that for every smooth affine group scheme $G$ over $\mathbb{Z}$, the dimension of each irreducible representation of $G(\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}^r)$ is given by one of finitely many polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ evaluated at $q=|\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}|$, provided that the residue characteristic $p=\mathrm{char} \mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}$ is large and fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an action of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ on the category of Soergel Bimodules of type $A_1 \times A_1$ induced by the nontrivial automorphism of its Dynkin diagram. We give an isotopy presentation by local generators and relations of the equivariantization of the category of Soergel Bimodules of type $A_1 \times A_1$ under this action. This is the first step in a program to describe and study the categories of equivariant Soergel Bimodules.</description>

      <title>Subdivision of KLRW Algebras in Affine Type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the subdivision map between two KLRW algebras of type $A^{(1)}_e$ and $A^{(1)}_{e+1}$. We show that the image of an idempotent indexed by a partition under this map is still an idempotent indexed by a partition, and give the form of this new partition. Moreover, we give an equality of some graded decomposition numbers.</description>

      <title>Representation stability in the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements associated to irreducible representations of the symmetric-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most classically relevant Hyperplane arrangements are the Braid Arrangements $B_n$ and their associated compliment spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$. In their recent work, Tsilevich, Vershik, and Yuzvinsky construct what they refer to as the intrinsic hyperplane arrangement within any irreducible representation of the symmetric group that generalize the classical braid arrangements. Through examples it is also shown that the associated compliment spaces to these intrinsic arrangements display behaviors far removed from $\mathcal{F}_n$. In this work we study the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements of irreducible representations of the symmetric group from the perspective of representation stability.</description>

      <title>Constructive Universal Approximation Theorems for Deep Joint-Equivariant Networks by Schur's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified constructive universal approximation theorem covering a wide range of learning machines including both shallow and deep neural networks based on the group representation theory. Constructive here means that the distribution of parameters is given in a closed-form expression (called the ridgelet transform). Contrary to the case of shallow models, expressive power analysis of deep models has been conducted in a case-by-case manner. Recently, Sonoda et al. (2023a,b) developed a systematic method to show a constructive approximation theorem from scalar-valued joint-group-invariant feature maps, covering a formal deep network. However, each hidden layer was formalized as an abstract group action, so it was not possible to cover real deep networks defined by composites of nonlinear activation function. In this study, we extend the method for vector-valued joint-group-equivariant feature maps, so to cover such real networks.</description>

This work vastly generalizes the type A case, and generalizes Brouwer's work on oppositeness graph of these buildings.</description>

      <title>Integration of Hochschild cohomology, derived Picard groups and uniqueness of lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</description>

      <title>Rational singularities for moment maps of totally negative quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the zero-fiber of the moment map of a totally negative quiver has rational singularities. Our proof consists in generalizing dimension bounds on jet spaces of this fiber, which were introduced by Budur. We also transfer the rational singularities property to other moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories, based on recent work of Davison. This has interesting arithmetic applications on quiver moment maps and moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories. First, we generalize results of Wyss on the asymptotic behaviour of counts of jets of quiver moment maps over finite fields. Moreover, we interpret the limit of counts of jets on a given moduli space as its p-adic volume under a canonical measure analogous to the measure built by Carocci, Orecchia and Wyss on certain moduli spaces of coherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the local $L^2$-Bound of the Eisenstein Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth of the local $L^2$-norms of the unitary Eisenstein series for reductive groups over number fields, in terms of their parameters. We derive a \emph{poly-logarithmic} bound on an average, for a large class of reductive groups. The method is based on Arthur's development of the spectral side of the trace formula, and ideas of Finis, Lapid, and M\"uller. As applications of our method, we prove the optimal lifting property for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})$ for square-free $q$, as well as the Sarnak--Xue counting property for the principal congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ of square-free level. This makes the recent results of Assing--Blomer unconditional.</description>

Abstract: We define Hecke correspondences and Hecke operators on unitary RZ spaces and study their basic geometric properties, including a commutativity conjecture on Hecke operators. Then we formulate the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma conjecture for the spherical Hecke algebra. We also formulate a conjecture on the abundance of spherical Hecke functions with identically vanishing first derivative of orbital integrals. We prove these conjectures for the case $U(1)\times U(2)$.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative differential geometry on crossed product algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a differential structure on arbitrary cleft extensions $B:=A^{\mathrm{co}H}\subseteq A$ for an $H$-comodule algebra $A$. This is achieved by constructing a covariant calculus on the corresponding crossed product algebra $B\#_\sigma H$ from the data of a bicovariant calculus on the structure Hopf algebra $H$ and a calculus on the base algebra $B$, which is compatible with the $2$-cocycle and measure of the crossed product. The result is a quantum principal bundle with canonical strong connection and we describe the induced bimodule covariant derivatives on associated bundles of the crossed product. It is proven that connections of the quantum principal bundle are in bijection with connection $1$-forms. All results specialize to trivial extensions and smash product algebras $B\#H$ and we give a characterization of the smash product calculus in terms of the differentials of the cleaving map $j\colon H\to A$ and the inclusion $B\hookrightarrow A$. The construction is exemplified for pointed Hopf algebras. In particular, the case of Radford Hopf algebras $H_{(r,n,q)}$ is spelled out in detail.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the quantum algebraic formalism of the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$, where D2/D4/D6/D8-branes are present. We demonstrate that the contour integral formulas have free field interpretations, leading to the operator formalism of $qq$-characters associated with each D-brane. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence.
  Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations, $q$-characters, and the Bethe ansatz equations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$. This connection provides insights into the Bethe/Gauge correspondence of the gauge origami system from both gauge-theoretic and quantum-algebraic perspectives.
  We finally present conjectures regarding generalizations to general toric Calabi-Yau four-folds. These generalizations imply the existence of an extensive class of $qq$-characters, which we call BPS $qq$-characters. These BPS $qq$-characters offer a new systematic approach to derive a broader range of BPS/CFT correspondence and Bethe/Gauge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Discovering Abstract Symbolic Relations by Learning Unitary Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a principled approach for symbolic operation completion (SOC), a minimal task for studying symbolic reasoning. While conceptually similar to matrix completion, SOC poses a unique challenge in modeling abstract relationships between discrete symbols. We demonstrate that SOC can be efficiently solved by a minimal model - a bilinear map - with a novel factorized architecture. Inspired by group representation theory, this architecture leverages matrix embeddings of symbols, modeling each symbol as an operator that dynamically influences others.
  Our model achieves perfect test accuracy on SOC with comparable or superior sample efficiency to Transformer baselines across most datasets, while boasting significantly faster learning speeds (100-1000$\times$). Crucially, the model exhibits an implicit bias towards learning general group structures, precisely discovering the unitary representations of underlying groups. This remarkable property not only confers interpretability but also significant implications for automatic symmetry discovery in geometric deep learning.
  Overall, our work establishes group theory as a powerful guiding principle for discovering abstract algebraic structures in deep learning, and showcases matrix representations as a compelling alternative to traditional vector embeddings for modeling symbolic relationships.</description>

Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>

Abstract: We build a one-to-one correspondence between $3$-dimensional (generic) crystabelline representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and certain locally analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the correspondence can be realized in subspaces of $p$-adic automorphic representations.</description>
