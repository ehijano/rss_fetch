      <title>Nanosecond Radio-Frequency Pulse Driven Photogun for Very Hard X-ray Free-electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One pathway to producing high brightness electron beams is to use a radio-frequency (rf) driven high field photogun to rapidly accelerate photoemitted electrons to the relativistic regime and pre- serve the brightness. However, the highest attainable field is limited by rf breakdowns of materials used in a photogun. Shortening rf pulse duration feeding into a photogun provides a viable path- way to achieve high field and prevent rf breakdowns. Here we propose and investigate Compressed Ultrashort Pulse Injector Demonstrator (CUPID), a nanosecond rf pulses driven photogun powered by a klystron and rf pulse compression system capable of achieving 300 MW at 20 ns duration, to produce bright electron beams with high electric field. We first introduce the design of the CUPID photogun and its expected rf performance at 500 MV/m driven by high power nanosecond rf pulses, followed by beam dynamics studies showing its capability for producing bright electron beams with 60 nm emittance when forming a photoinjector with a superconducting solenoid and downstream accelerating structures. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept start-to-end simulation of the CUPID photoinjector paired with the existing Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) copper accelerator free-electron laser (FEL) to demonstrate achievable mJ pulse energy very hard x-ray photons at 40 keV or higher.</description>

      <title>CW SRF Gun generating beam parameters sufficient for CW hard-X-ray FEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SRF CW accelerator constructed for Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) Proof-of-principle (POP) experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory has frequently demonstrated record parameters using 1.5 nC 350 ps long electron bunches, typically compressed to FWHM of 30 ps using ballistic compression. We report experimental demonstration of CW electron beam with parameters fully satisfying requirements for hard X-ray FEL and significantly exceeding those demonstrated by APEX LCLS II electron gun. This was achieved using a 10-year-old SRF gun with a modest accelerating gradient of $\sim$15 MV/m, a bunching cavity followed by ballistic compression to generate 100 pC, $\sim$15 ps FWHM electron bunches with a normalized slice emittance of $\sim$0.2 mm-mrad and a normalized projected emittance of $\sim$0.25 mm-mrad. Hence, in this paper, we present an alternative method for generating CW electron beams for hard-X-ray FELs using existing and proven accelerator technology. We present a description of the accelerator system settings, details of projected and slice emittance measurements as well as relevant beam dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Function with Applications in Beam Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe longitudinal fine structure like microbunching within a particle beam, a classical approach is to define a bunching factor which is the Fourier transform of the particle longitudinal density distribution. Such a 1D definition of bunching factor can be generalized to a 6D spectral form function (SFF) to describe more complicated structure in phase space. The complex SFF is another complete description of beam in spectral domain and can offer complementary and valuable insight in beam dynamics study which usually invokes the real particle density distribution. The basic property and Fokker-Planck equation of the SFF is presented, along with its solution in a general coupled linear lattice. The example applications of SFF in electron storage ring physics and laser-induced microbunching are presented.</description>

      <title>A Diffusive Model for Radio-Frequency Knock-Out Slow Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow resonant extraction from synchrotrons via radio-frequency knock-out is a well-established technique to deliver charged particle beams for various applications. In this contribution, we present explicit analytical expressions for calculating the number of particles slowly extracted over time, commonly referred to as spills. The proposed formulation enables the semi-analytical determination of an amplitude modulation curve to be applied to the radio-frequency exciter, which flattens the spill macrostructure, a feature of high relevance to all users requiring uniform beam delivery.</description>

      <title>High Power Arbitrary RF Pulse Shaping Tests with NG-LLRF and Cool Copper Collider Prototype Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RF pulse modulation techniques are widely applied to shape RF pulses for various types of RF stations of particle accelerators. The amplitude and phase modulations are typically implemented with additional RF components that require drive or control electronics. For the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) based next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform, which we have developed in the last several years, RF modulation and demodulation are fully implemented in the digital domain. Therefore, arbitrary RF pulse shaping can be realized without any additional analogue components. We performed a range of high-power experiments with the NG-LLRF and a prototype Cool Copper Collider (C\(^3\)) structure. In this paper, the RF field measured at different stages with different pulse shapes and peak power levels up to 16.45 MW will be demonstrated and analyzed. The high precision pulse shaping schemes of the NG-LLRF can be applied to realize the phase modulation for a linear accelerator injector, the phase reversal for a pulse compressor, or the modulation required to compensate for the beam loading effect.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Studies of Dark Current in Radiofrequency Structures for Short-Pulse High-Gradient Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-gradient acceleration is a key research area that could enable compact linear accelerators for future colliders, light sources, and other applications. In the pursuit of high-gradient operation, RF breakdown limits the attainable accelerating gradient in normal-conducting RF structures. Recent experiments at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator suggest a promising approach: using short RF pulses with durations of a few nanoseconds. Experimental studies show that these O(1 ns) RF pulses can mitigate breakdown limitations, resulting in higher gradients. For example, an electric field of nearly 400 MV/m was achieved in an X-band photoemission gun driven by 6-ns-long RF pulses, with rapid RF conditioning and low dark current observed. Despite these promising results, the short-pulse regime remains an under-explored parameter space, and RF breakdown physics under nanosecond-long pulses requires further investigation. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical simulations of dark current dynamics in accelerating cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. We study breakdown-associated processes spanning different time scales, including field emission, multipacting, and plasma formation, using simulations of the X-band photogun cavities. The results reveal the advantages of using short RF pulses to reduce dark current and mitigate RF breakdown, offering a path toward a new class of compact accelerators with enhanced performance and reduced susceptibility to breakdown.</description>

      <title>Wide frequency-range acceleration using second harmonic RF bucket in fixed field accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel acceleration scheme for fixed-field accelerators (FFAs), in which RF buckets with harmonic numbers $h = 1$ and $h = 2$ are time-sequenced to form a single, continuous acceleration path. This approach completes acceleration in two RF frequency sweeps, thereby reducing the total frequency sweep range and shortening the repetition period. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated through longitudinal simulations based on parameters of the FFA at the Institute for Integrated Radiation and Nuclear Science, Kyoto University (KURNS). We also establish operational conditions under which the second harmonic RF bucket remains stable and practically usable.</description>
