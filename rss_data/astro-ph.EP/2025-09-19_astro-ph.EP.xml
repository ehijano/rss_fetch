      <title>Mapping the SO2 Shoreline in Gas Giant Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq &gt; 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species</description>

      <title>New Orbital Constraints for YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B from High-Precision Astrometry and Planetary Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756. For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Metastable helium in the thermosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a recently launched astronomy mission, detected a bright 1.083 micron emission feature in the commissioning data. The PI group attributed this feature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and aeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day and observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx is located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and helium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by metastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a rich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of metastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion, with data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid variations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south pole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of metastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of considerable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites, since drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these satellites. SPHEREx, along with on-going ground-based studies (passive NIR spectroscopy, lidar, incoherent scatter radar), is poised to contribute to this topic.</description>

      <title>Infall and Disk Processes - the Message from Meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials.
  Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.</description>

      <title>Sibling Sub-Neptunes Around Sibling M Dwarfs: TOI-521 and TOI-912</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spherical geometry: Unraveling complex features of objects orbiting around stars from its transit light curve using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena. This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Two-Dimensional Thermal Structures of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flexible, annulus-by-annulus method to constrain the 2-D thermal structure of a protoplanetary disk from optically thick spectral line emission. Using synthetic disk models with a known temperature and density structure, we extracted the vertical emission surfaces and brightness temperatures in radial annuli for multiple CO isotopologue transitions and used them to infer the vertical temperature profiles. This approach reliably recovers the injected temperature structure despite noise and finite resolution. We demonstrated that even a modest set of emission lines can constrain the temperature across a wide range of radii and elevations. Nevertheless, biases in the extracted emission surfaces constitute a major source of systematic error. Finally, we applied this method to archival ALMA observations of the HD 163296 disk, revealing that simple parametric radial temperature models may obscure the complexity of real disks and that additional observations are necessary to distinguish between different models of the vertical structure. This flexible framework can be readily applied to other systems, helping to characterize the thermal environments that shape planet formation.</description>

      <title>A carbon-rich disk surrounding a planetary-mass companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the final assembly of gas giant planets, circumplanetary disks (CPDs) of gas and dust form due to the conservation of angular momentum, providing material to be accreted onto the planet and the ingredients for moons. The composition of these disks has remained elusive, as their faint nature and short separations from their host stars have limited our ability to access them. Now, with the spatial and spectral resolution of JWST/MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrograph, we can observe and characterize this reservoir for wide-orbit planetary-mass companions for the first time. We present the mid-infrared spectrum from the CPD surrounding the young companion CT Cha b. The data show a carbon-rich chemistry with seven carbon-bearing molecules (up to C$_6$H$_6$) and one isotopologue detected and indicate a high gaseous C/O$&gt;$1 that is in contrast with the elemental abundance ratios typically measured in directly imaged gas giant atmospheres. This carbon-rich chemistry is also in stark contrast to the spectrum of the disk surrounding the host star, CT Cha A, which shows no carbon-bearing molecules. This difference in disk chemistry between the host disk and its companion indicates rapid, divergent chemical evolution on $\sim$million-year timescales. Nonetheless, the chemical properties of the CPD follow trends observed in isolated objects, where disks transition from an oxygen-rich to carbon-rich composition with decreasing host mass. Our results provide the first direct insight into the chemical and physical properties of material being accreted onto a gas giant analogue and into its potential moon system.</description>

      <title>The cosmic journey of dust grains - from nucleation to planetary system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust is essential to the evolution of galaxies and drives the formation of planetary systems. The challenge of inferring the origin of different presolar dust grains from meteoritic samples motivates forward modelling to understand the contributions of low- and high-mass stars to dust in our Solar System. In this work we follow the evolution of dust with tracer particles within a hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like isolated disc galaxy. We find that nearly half of the grains released from stars lose less than $10\%$ of their initial mass due to thermal sputtering in the interstellar medium (ISM), with an average degree of atomisation $\sim$$10\%$ higher for dust grains released by supernovae relative to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star grains. We show through supernova remnant model variations that supernova (SN) dust survival is primarily shaped by the supernova bubble environment in the first million years (Myr) after the explosion rather than by its evolution during $10^2-10^3$ Myr in the ISM. The AGB/SN ratio of dust grains incorporated into newly formed stars approaches $0.8$ after a few hundred Myr of galactic evolution. Our analysis also shows that star-forming particles with short ($&lt;$$10$ Myr) free-floating time-scales in the ISM are predominantly released from supernovae rather than AGB stars. This implies that the Solar System budget of short-lived radioactive isotopes such as $^{26}$Al, whose decay contributed to melting and differentiating planetesimals, should have been provided by massive stars with masses $M \gtrsim 8$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>KID Detector Readout Electronics Development for Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the status and goals of the readout electronics system we are developing to support the detector arrays in the coronagraph instrument on the NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission currently in development. HWO aims to revolutionize exoplanet exploration by performing direct imaging and spectroscopy of 25 or more habitable exoplanets, and to resolve a broad range of astrophysics science questions as well. Since exoplanet yield depends critically on the detector dark count rate, as we show in this paper, the ambitious goals of HWO require arrays of single-photon energy-resolving detectors. We argue that Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) are best suited to meet these requirements. To support the detectors required for HWO and future far-IR missions, at the required power consumption and detector count, we are developing a radiation-tolerant reconfigurable readout system for both imaging and energy-resolving single photon KID detector arrays. We leverage an existing RFSoC-based system we built for NASA balloons that has a power consumption of 30 Watts and reads out 2000-4000 detectors (i.e. 7-15 mW/pixel), and move to a radiation tolerant Kintex Ultrascale FPGA chip to bring low-power wide bandwidth readout to a space-qualified platform for the first time. This improves significantly over previous spaceflight systems, and delivers what is required for NASA's future needs: ~100,000 pixels with less than 1 kW total power consumption. Overall, the system we are developing is a significant step forward in capability, and retires many key risks for the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission.</description>

Abstract: Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) is the classical problem of estimating the orbit of a body in space without any presumed information about the orbit. The geometric formulation of the ''angles-only'' IOD in three-dimensional space: find a conic curve with a given focal point meeting the given lines of sight (LOS). We provide an algebraic reformulation of this problem and confirm that five is the minimal number of lines necessary to have a finite number of solutions in a non-special case, and the number of complex solutions is 66. We construct a subdivision method to search for the normal direction to the orbital plane as a point on the real projective plane. The resulting algorithm is fast as it discovers only a handful of the solutions that are real and physically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>

Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variations in HIP 41378: CHEOPS and TESS confirm a non-transiting sixth planet in the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>Increasing science yield with a twilight observing program with the SCALES instrument at Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While astronomical twilight closes the observing window for optical astronomers, the infrared sky remains dark even through sunrise, allowing IR astronomers to observe through twilight. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph scheduled to arrive at Keck in early 2026. SCALES has the potential to execute exciting science and support the astronomical community and upcoming NASA missions through a dedicated cadenced twilight observing program. We estimate that the current twilight observing program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.</description>
