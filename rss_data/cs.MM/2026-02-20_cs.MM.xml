      <title>CAFE: Channel-Autoregressive Factorized Encoding for Robust Biosignal Spatial Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-density biosignal recordings are critical for neural decoding and clinical monitoring, yet real-world deployments often rely on low-density (LD) montages due to hardware and operational constraints. This motivates spatial super-resolution from LD observations, but heterogeneous dependencies under sparse and noisy measurements often lead to artifact propagation and false non-local correlations. To address this, we propose CAFE, a plug-and-play rollout generation scheme that reconstructs the full montage in geometry-aligned stages. Starting from the LD channels, CAFE first recovers nearby channels and then progressively expands to more distal regions, exploiting reliable local structure before introducing non-local interactions. During training, step-wise supervision is applied over channel groups and teacher forcing with epoch-level scheduled sampling along the group dimension is utilized to reduce exposure bias, enabling parallel computation across steps. At test time, CAFE performs an autoregressive rollout across groups, while remaining plug-and-play by reusing any temporal backbone as the shared predictor. Evaluated on $4$ modalities and $6$ datasets, CAFE demonstrates plug-and-play generality across $3$ backbones (MLP, Conv, Transformer) and achieves consistently better reconstruction than $5$ representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Generative Audio Extension and Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In audio-related creative tasks, sound designers often seek to extend and morph different sounds from their libraries. Generative audio models, capable of creating audio using examples as references, offer promising solutions. By masking the noisy latents of a DiT and applying a novel variant of classifier-free guidance on such masked latents, we demonstrate that: (i) given an audio reference, we can extend it both forward and backward for a specified duration, and (ii) given two audio references, we can morph them seamlessly for the desired duration. Furthermore, we show that by fine-tuning the model on different types of stationary audio data we mitigate potential hallucinations. The effectiveness of our method is supported by objective metrics, with the generated audio achieving Fr\'echet Audio Distances (FADs) comparable to those of real samples from the training data. Additionally, we validate our results through a subjective listener test, where subjects gave positive ratings to the proposed model generations. This technique paves the way for more controllable and expressive generative sound frameworks, enabling sound designers to focus less on tedious, repetitive tasks and more on their actual creative process.</description>

      <title>Is there a relationship between Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating perceived video quality is essential for ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) in modern streaming applications. While existing subjective datasets and Video Quality Metrics (VQMs) cover a broad quality range, many practical use cases especially for premium users focus on high quality scenarios requiring finer granularity. Just Noticeable Difference (JND) has emerged as a key concept for modeling perceptual thresholds in these high end regions and plays an important role in perceptual bitrate ladder construction. However, the relationship between JND and the more widely used Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) subjective study based on an existing JND dataset to examine how MOS corresponds to the 75% Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) points of the 1st and 2nd JNDs. We find that while MOS values at JND points generally align with theoretical expectations (e.g., 4.75 for the 75% SUR of the 1st JND), the reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals across PVS indices. Statistical significance analysis further shows that DCR studies with limited participants may not detect meaningful differences between reference and JND videos.</description>

      <title>HybridPrompt: Bridging Generative Priors and Traditional Codecs for Mobile Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Video on Demand (VoD) scenarios, traditional codecs are the industry standard due to their high decoding efficiency. However, they suffer from severe quality degradation under low bandwidth conditions. While emerging generative neural codecs offer significantly higher perceptual quality, their reliance on heavy frame-by-frame generation makes real-time playback on mobile devices impractical. We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone. Specifically, we employ a hybrid architecture that encodes Keyframes using a generative model while relying on traditional codecs for the remaining frames. A major challenge is that the two paradigms have conflicting objectives: the "hallucinated" details from generative models often misalign with the rigid prediction mechanisms of traditional codecs, causing bitrate inefficiency. To address this, we demonstrate that the traditional decoding process is differentiable, enabling an end-to-end optimization loop. This allows us to use subsequent frames as additional supervision, forcing the generative model to synthesize keyframes that are not only perceptually high-fidelity but also mathematically optimal references for the traditional codec. By integrating a two-stage generation strategy, our system outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving an average LPIPS gain of 8% over traditional codecs at 200kbps.</description>

      <title>Art2Mus: Artwork-to-Music Generation via Visual Conditioning and Large-Scale Cross-Modal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>PP-Motion: Physical-Perceptual Fidelity Evaluation for Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film, sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of motion fidelity than previous work.</description>

      <title>Learning Perceptual Representations for Gaming NR-VQA with Multi-Task FR Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) for gaming videos is challenging due to limited human-rated datasets and unique content characteristics including fast motion, stylized graphics, and compression artifacts. We present MTL-VQA, a multi-task learning framework that uses full-reference metrics as supervisory signals to learn perceptually meaningful features without human labels for pretraining. By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA. Experiments on gaming video datasets show MTL-VQA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art NR-VQA methods across both MOS-supervised and label-efficient/self-supervised settings.</description>
