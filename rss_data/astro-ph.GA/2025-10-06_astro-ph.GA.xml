      <title>Threading the Magellanic Needle: Hypervelocity Stars Trace the Past Location of the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries have shown that a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use three such HVSs as dynamical tracers to constrain the past orbit of the LMC. Since each star was ejected at a finite time in the past, it must intersect the past position of the LMC's central black hole at its ejection time. We model the LMC's orbit under the influence of dynamical friction and extended mass distributions for both the LMC and the Milky Way, generating a large ensemble of orbital realizations. By evaluating which orbits intersect the back-integrated HVS trajectories, we compute posterior distributions over the LMC's orbital history. This approach provides significantly tighter constraints on the past motion of the LMC than previously possible. We find two previously published orbital models that are consistent with these new constraints: a first-passage trajectory from a self-consistent hydrodynamic simulation, and a second-passage trajectory from a collisionless N-body simulation. In parallel, we infer the present-day ejection site of the HVSs -- likely tracing the LMC's dynamical center and supermassive black hole -- independent of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>The LMC Corona as Evidence for a First Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter (second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find truncation radii of $15.3\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.</description>

      <title>H I Properties of Field Galaxies at $\boldsymbol{z\approx 0.2}$-0.6: Insights into Declining Cosmic Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report statistically significant detection of H I 21-cm emission from intermediate-redshift ($z\approx0.2$-0.6) galaxies. By leveraging multi-sightline galaxy survey data from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) and deep radio observations from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS), we have established a sample of $\approx6000$ spectroscopically identified galaxies in 11 distinct fields to constrain the neutral gas content at intermediate redshifts. The galaxies sample a broad range in stellar mass -- $8\lesssim\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\lesssim11$ with a median of $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle_\rm{med}\approx10$ -- and a wide range in redshift -- $0.24\lesssim z\lesssim0.63$ with a median of $\langle z\rangle_\rm{med}=0.44$. Our detected emission-line signal exceeds $4\,\sigma$ significance in the stacked spectra of all subsamples, and the observed total H I 21-cm line flux translates to a H I mass $M_\rm{H\;I}\approx10^{10}\rm{M}_\odot$. We find a high H I-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx6$ for low-mass galaxies with $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle \approx9.3$ ($&gt;3.7\,\sigma$). For galaxies with $\langle\log{M_\rm{star}/\rm{M}_\odot}\rangle\approx10.6$, we find $M_\mathrm{H\;I}/M_\rm{star}\approx0.3$ ($&gt;4.7\,\sigma$). Additionally, the redshift evolution of H I mass in both low- and high-mass field galaxies, inferred from the stacked emission-line signal, aligns well with the expectation from the cosmic star formation history. This suggests that the overall decline in the cosmic star formation activity across the general galaxy population may be connected to a decreasing supply of neutral hydrogen. Finally, our analysis has revealed significant 21-cm signals at distances greater than 75 kpc from these intermediate-redshift galaxies, indicating a substantial reservoir of H I gas in their extended surroundings.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dark matter distribution of massive galaxy clusters from deep optical observations: insights from the TNG300 simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic stars within galaxy clusters contribute to the intracluster light (ICL), which is thought to be a promising tracer of the underlying dark matter (DM) distribution. In this study, we employ the TNG300 simulation to investigate the prospect of recovering the dark matter distribution of galaxy clusters from deep, wide-field optical images. For this, we generate mock observations of 40 massive clusters ($M_{200}\gtrsim 10^{14.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) at $z=0.06$ for the $g'$ band of the Wendelstein Wide-Field Imager (WWFI), and isolate the emission from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL by masking the satellite galaxies, following observational procedures. By comparing $\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ profiles from these images against $\Sigma_{\rm DM}$ profiles for the central subhaloes, we find that $\Sigma_{\rm cen-DM}/\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ exhibits a quasi-linear scaling relation in log space with the normalised distance $r/R_{\Delta}$, for both $R_{\Delta}=R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$. The scatter in the scaling is predominantly stochastic, showing a weak dependence on formation time and dynamical state. We recover the DM concentration and mass within $\approx 23$ and $\approx 15$ per cent of their true values (for $R_{200}$), respectively, and with $\approx 3$ per cent larger uncertainties for $R_{500}$. Alternatively, we find that the concentration can be estimated using the BCG+ICL fraction, the central's DM mass using the BCG+ICL flux, and the total DM mass using the bolometric flux. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving dark matter characteristics of galaxy clusters to be observed with facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the near future.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF. XXI.: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematics in the G012.80 protocluster: Evidence for filament rotation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) We aim to characterize kinematic processes in the G012.80 protocluster. We principally focus on the N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) emission to trace the dense and cold gas. Additionally, we use lines such as DCN(3$-$2), H41$\alpha$, C$^{18}$O(1$-$0), and SiO(5$-$4), as well as continuum maps. We perform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple velocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients, column densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012, named R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\lambda$($\omega$) = 5660 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\lambda$($\omega$) = 6943 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than those of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity (PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1} $pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple rotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a rotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity structures ($\Delta$V &lt; 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by the presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar outflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped Filament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only contains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2. Combining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still rotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR. G012 thus hosts filaments at different evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>On the Frequency of Multiple Galaxy Mergers in $\Lambda$CDM Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers are believed to play a pivotal role in galaxy evolution, and measuring the galaxy merger fraction is a longstanding goal of both observational and theoretical studies. In this work, we extend the consideration of the merger fraction from the standard measure of binary mergers, namely those comprising two merging galaxies, to multiple mergers, namely mergers involving three or more galaxies. We use the Illustris and IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical prediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple merger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship between the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$. We generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that $f_m\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested observationally. We further compare the empirical simulation results with toy models where mergers occur, on the evolution timeline of a galaxy, either at constant intervals or as a Poisson process at a constant rate. From these comparisons, where the toy models typically produce lower multiple merger fractions, we conclude that in cosmological simulations, mergers are more strongly clustered in time than in these toy scenarios, likely reflecting the hierarchical nature of cosmological structure formation.</description>

      <title>Woven by the Whirls: The growth and entrainment of cold clouds in turbulent hot winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic and intergalactic flows often exhibit relative motion between the cold dense gas and the hot diffuse medium. Such multiphase flows -- involving gas at different temperatures, densities, and ionization states -- for instance, galactic winds, are frequently turbulent. However, idealized simulations typically model the winds and driven turbulence separately, despite their intertwined roles in galaxy evolution. To address this, we investigate the survival of a dense cloud in a hot wind subject to continuous external turbulent forcing. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations across a range of turbulent Mach numbers in the hot phase $\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}=v_{\rm turb}/c_{\rm s, wind}$ from 0.1 to 0.7 ($c_{\rm s, wind}$ and $v_{\rm turb}$ being the sound speed and the turbulent velocity in the hot phase, respectively). We find that in spite of the additional subsonic turbulence, cold clouds can survive if the cooling time of the mixed gas $t_{\rm cool, mix}$ is shorter than a modified destruction time $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}$, i.e., $t_{\rm cool,mix}/\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}&lt;1$ where $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}=t_{\rm cc}/(1+\left(\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}/\left(f_{\rm mix}\mathcal{M}_{\rm wind}\right)\right)^2)^{1/2}$, where $f_{\rm mix}\sim0.6$ is a fudge factor. Moreover, in the `survival regime', turbulence can enhance the growth of cold clouds by up to an order of magnitude because of more efficient stretching and an associated increase in the surface area. This increase in mass transfer between the phases leads to significantly faster entrainment of cold material in turbulent winds. In contrast to the narrow filamentary tails formed in laminar winds, turbulence stretches the cold gas orthogonally, dispersing it over a larger area and changing absorption line signatures.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Galactic Expansion in Gaia DR3: Implications for the JWST Early-Galaxy Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p&lt;0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>A systematic study on the properties of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in active galactic nuclei with AKARI near-infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent near- and mid-infrared (IR) observations reveal the existence of appreciable amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust in the harsh environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the origins of which are still under discussion. In this paper, we analyze the near-IR spectra of AGNs obtained with AKARI to systematically study the properties of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust a ected by the AGN activity. We perform the spectral fitting and the spectral energy distribution fitting for our sample of 102 AGNs to obtain the fluxes of the aromatic and aliphatic spectral features, the total IR luminosity (L_IR), and the fractional luminosity of AGN components (L_AGN/L_IR). As a result, we find that L_aromatic/L_IR is systematically lower for the AGN sample, especially much lower for AGNs with the aliphatic feature seen in the absorption, than for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), while L_aliphatic/L_aromatic is systematically higher for the AGN sample than for the SFG sample, increasing with the AGN activity indicated by L_AGN/L_IR. In addition, the profiles of the aliphatic emission features of the AGN sample are significantly di erent from those of the SFG sample in that the AGNs have the feature intensities systematically stronger at longer wavelengths. We conclude that both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are likely of circumnuclear origins, suggesting that a significant amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon dust may come from a new population created through processes such as shattering of large carbonaceous grains by AGN outflows.</description>

      <title>Formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters: Lessons from N-body and MOCCA Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense star clusters are promising nurseries for the formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $\sim 10^2-10^5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), with increasing observational evidence pointing to their presence in massive star clusters and stripped dwarf-galaxy nuclei. During the early evolution of compact clusters, massive stars can rapidly segregate to the center, where frequent collisions may trigger the runaway growth of a very massive star (VMS). This object can subsequently collapse to form an IMBH or merge with a stellar-mass black hole. We carried out direct $N$-body and Monte Carlo simulations of star clusters with initial core densities between $10^6$ to $4\times 10^8\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and total masses of $5.9\times 10^5$ and $1.3\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. These models show that IMBHs of $10^3-10^4\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can form within $\leq 5$ Myr through the runaway collision channel. At later times, the IMBHs continue to grow through mergers with black holes, stars, and compact remnants, providing predictions testable with future gravitational-wave and transient surveys.</description>

      <title>DRAGON-III simulation: modelling million-body globular and nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a continuation of DRAGON-II, we present the DRAGON-III project, which focuses on the simulations of million-body globular clusters and nuclear clusters over 10 Gyr. We report on its preliminary results on globular clusters. The first 100 Myr of the simulations have produced 41 pulsars, 191 X-ray binaries, 17 gravitational wave sources, and one black hole-black hole merger due to the loss of orbital energy in the form of gravitational wave emission. The inclusion of initial soft binaries brings surprisingly interesting results, including one IMBH in a binary black hole, and compact object binaries resembling the Gaia-BH1 and the wide black hole-giant binary reported in Wang et al. (2024, Nat. Astro.).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) ice is abundant in space and is a key feedstock for seeding chemical complexity in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Despite its ubiquity, gas-phase methanol has only been detected in one disk around a Solar-type star to date, TW Hya. Here we present new high sensitivity (~1 mJy/beam) observations of TW Hya with ALMA that detect four individual transitions of gas-phase methanol spanning upper level energies from 17 to 38 K. We confirm the presence of gas-phase methanol in the luke-warm molecular layer of the disk ($35.9^{+25.9}_{-10.6}$ K) and with a disk-integrated column density of $1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A radially-resolved analysis suggests that the gas-phase methanol is centrally compact, peaking within the spatial extent of the mm-sized dust grains ($\lesssim 80$ au). Static gas-grain chemical disk models confirm photodesorption as an important mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase, with the column density further boosted by the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry, reactive desorption, and an increase in dust-grain surface area assuming fractal grains. However, no model can fully reproduce the observed column density nor the radial distribution, and we suggest that the inclusion of dynamic processes such as vertical mixing and radial drift would be required to do so. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of the precursors for complex chemistry in the planet-forming regions around Solar-type stars is ultimately controlled by the interplay of grain surface chemistry coupled with the evolution of dust in their disks.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Misalignments in Stellar Warp Structure as Dynamical Tracers of Mergers in Milky Way-like Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of warps in stellar disks using high-resolution Milky Way analogs from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function of stellar age.</description>

      <title>The Role of Spiral Arms in Galaxies II: Similarities Amid Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of spiral arms in galaxies -- whether they enhance star formation efficiency or primarily act as material gatherers -- remains an open question. Observational studies have yielded ambiguous results, in part due to the choice of star formation rate (SFR) tracers and their inherent limitations. These limitations are addressed here by applying multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to individual arm and interarm regions. We expand on our previous study of two galaxies to include six diverse galaxies, spanning over an order of magnitude in total stellar mass and factors of several in total SFR, for which spiral arms have been mapped. We find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_{star}$) can be used as a proxy for the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$), since the two quantities are directly proportional to each other in our regions. In our analysis of both tracers (sSFR and SFE) no significant difference is found the between arm and interarm regions, except for one galaxy (NGC 1097), supporting the gatherers scenario.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.</description>

      <title>High energy gamma-ray sources in the VVV survey - III. Spectroscopic confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to spectroscopically confirm the nature of VVV-J181258.71-314346.7, a candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144. This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1 $--$ 1.8~\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \sim 1200$. Standard data reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum reveals the presence of Pa$\beta$ and Fe\,\textsc{ii} emission lines. The measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs, particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitude ($b\sim -6.5${\deg}) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.</description>

      <title>Probing dust torus radius--luminosity relation: An WISE view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a redshift of $z&lt;$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.</description>

      <title>Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I. electron density and gas fraction to the virial radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Suzaku observations of 14 nearby galaxy clusters and groups (z &lt; 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius (approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.</description>

      <title>Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $\Lambda$CDM Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength continuum, emission line and BAL variability with prominent PV absorption in the X-ray-weakest quasar PG0043+039</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG0043+039 has been identified as an extremely X-ray-weak quasar and as a peculiar broad-absorption-line quasar based on UV HST spectra. We took simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022. PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of 3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong, with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission despite strong PV absorption. All the strong absorption-line troughs in the UV varied in unison in velocity space back and forward (-2000.+-300.kms-1, +2740.+-200.kms-1) without any major changes in absorption strength or in their profiles for the years 1991, 2013, and 2022. We found no general correlations of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations. However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013 and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud Interaction with Simulation Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way (MW) has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an observed reflex motion in the velocities of outer halo stars. We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \, \rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \, \rm km \, \rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\rm LMC}(&lt; 50 \, \rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\rm MW}(&lt; 50 \, \rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11}\, \rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\approx 10-15 \%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.</description>

      <title>A GLIMPSE into the very faint-end of the H$\beta$+[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 luminosity function at z=7-9 behind Abell S1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the ultra-deep GLIMPSE JWST/NIRCam survey to constrain the faint-end of the H$\beta$+[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 luminosity function (LF) down to $10^{39}$ erg/s at z=7-9 behind the lensed Hubble Frontier Field Abell S1063. We perform SED fitting on a Lyman-Break Galaxy sample, measuring combined H$\beta$+[OIII] fluxes to construct the emission-line LF. The resulting LF ($\alpha$=-1.55 to -1.78) is flatter than the UV LF ($\alpha&lt;-2$), indicating a lower number density of low H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters at fixed MUV. We explore three explanations: (i) bursty star formation histories reducing the H$\beta$+[OIII]-to-UV ratio, (ii) metallicity effects on [OIII]/H$\beta$, or (iii) a faint-end turnover in the UV LF. Assuming an evolving [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, we derive a flatter [OIII]$\lambda$5008 LF ($\alpha$=-1.45 to -1.66) and a steeper H$\beta$ LF ($\alpha$=-1.68 to -1.95). The combination of decreasing metallicity and bursty star formation can reconcile the UV and H$\beta$+[OIII] LF differences. Converting the LF to the ionising photon production rate, we find that galaxies with H$\alpha$ flux $&gt;10^{39}$ erg/s (SFR(H$\alpha$)$&gt;5\times10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr) contribute 21-61% and 24-104% of the ionising photon budget at 7&lt;z&lt;8 and 8&lt;z&lt;9, respectively (for $f_{esc}=0.1$). The LF shape suggests faint galaxies contribute minimally to the ionising photon production rate. Our cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) estimates align with previous work, but GLIMPSE's sensitivity to low SFRs confirms that very faint galaxies are minor contributors to both the ionising photon production rate and the CSFRD. Our results suggest that GLIMPSE has detected the bulk of the total H$\beta$+[OIII] emission from star-forming galaxies, with fainter sources playing a limited role in cosmic reionisation.</description>

      <title>Doubly Discordant SH0ES NGC4258 Cepheid Relations (HVI), and Impactful Extinction Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S$H_0$ES 2016-2022 $HVI$ data for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield doubly discordant Wesenheit Leavitt functions:~$\Delta W_{0,H-VI} = -0.13\pm0^{m}.02$ ($-0^{m}.17$ unweighted) and that is paired with a previously noted $\Delta W_{0,I-VI}\simeq-0^{m}.3$, which in concert with complimentary evidence suggest the 2016 S$H_0$ES NGC4258-anchored $H_0 \pm \sigma_{H_0}$ warrants scrutiny (i.e., $\sigma_{H_0}/{H_0}\gtrsim 6$\%). Cepheid distance uncertainties are further exacerbated by extinction law ambiguities endemic to such Leavitt relations (e.g., NGC4258), particularly for comparatively obscured variables (e.g., $\Delta d \gtrsim 4$\%, reddened Cepheid subsamples in the Milky Way, M31, NGC2442, NGC4424, NGC5643, NGC7250). Lastly, during the analysis it was identified that the 2022 S$H_0$ES database relays incorrect SMC Cepheid photometry.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.</description>

      <title>From theory to observation: understanding filamentary flows in high-mass star-forming clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.</description>

      <title>Edge-On Disk Study (EODS) II: HCO$^+$ and CO vertical stratification in the disk surrounding SSTTau042021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the \textsc{DiskFit} model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of $\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\sim 3 \times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\sim$ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius ($\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\sim$ 35 K above.</description>

      <title>Abundance of strontium in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Model Subtraction with a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy model subtraction removes the smooth light of nearby galaxies so that fainter sources (e.g., stars, star clusters, background galaxies) can be identified and measured. Traditional approaches (isophotal or parametric fitting) are semi-automated and can be challenging for large data sets. We build a convolutional denoising autoencoder (DAE) for galaxy model subtraction: images are compressed to a latent representation and reconstructed to yield the smooth galaxy, suppressing other objects. The DAE is trained on GALFIT-generated model galaxies injected into real sky backgrounds and tested on real images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). To quantify performance, we conduct an injection-recovery experiment on residual images by adding mock globular clusters (GCs) with known fluxes and positions. Our tests confirm a higher recovery rate of mock GCs near galaxy centers for complex morphologies, while matching ellipse fitting for smooth ellipticals. Overall, the DAE achieves subtraction equivalent to isophotal ellipse fitting for regular ellipticals and superior results for galaxies with high ellipticities or spiral features. Photometry of small-scale sources on DAE residuals is consistent with that on ellipse-subtracted residuals. Once trained, the DAE processes an image cutout in $\lesssim 0.1$ s, enabling fast, fully automatic analysis of large data sets. We make our code available for download and use.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of different galaxy properties to warm dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass on galaxy properties using 1,024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the DREAMS project. We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.</description>

      <title>Spatially Coherent 3D Distributions of HI and CO in the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, for example, Galactic structure, star formation, and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires spatial knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities. Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit, had a fixed velocity field, and lacked resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. We used 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we took absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures that there is high resolution nearby. We inferred the spatial distributions of atomic hydrogen (HI), carbon monoxide (CO), their emission line widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrained these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters. Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high-quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dedicated automated pipeline to construct spatially resolved emission H$\alpha$+[NII] maps and to derive the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in 12 optical filters (five broad and seven narrow/medium) of H$\alpha$ emission line regions in nearby galaxies (z $&lt;$ 0.0165) observed by the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS). We used the $J0660$ filter of $140${\AA} width centered at $6600${\AA} to trace H$\alpha$ + [NII] emission and $r$ and $i$ broad bands were used to estimate the stellar continuum. We create pure emission line images after the continnum subtraction, where the H$\alpha$ emission line regions were detected. This method was also applied to Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic data from PHANGS-MUSE, CALIFA and MaNGA surveys by building synthetic narrow-bands based on J-PLUS filters. The studied sample includes the cross-matched catalog of these IFU surveys with J-PLUS third data release (DR3), amounting to $2$ PHANGS-MUSE, $78$ CALIFA, and $78$ MaNGA galaxies at $z &lt; 0.0165$, respectively. We compared the H$\alpha$+[NII] radial profiles from J-PLUS and the IFU surveys, finding good agreement within the expected uncertainties. We also compared the SEDs from the emission line regions detected in J-PLUS images, reproducing the main spectral features present in the spectroscopic data. Finally, we compared the emission fluxes from the J-PLUS and IFU surveys accounting for scale differences, finding a difference of only 2% with a dispersion of 7% in the measurements. The J-PLUS data provides reliable spatially resolved H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps for nearby galaxies. We provide the J-PLUS DR3 catalog for the $158$ galaxies with IFU data, including emission maps, SEDs of star-forming clumps, and radial profiles.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the galactic and intergalactic components in 313 observed Lyman-alpha line profiles between redshift 0 and 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-Alpha (Lya) photons emitted in star-forming regions inside galaxies experience a complex radiative transfer process until they reach the observer. The Lya line profile that we measured on Earth is, thus, the convolution of the gas properties in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), and intergalactic medium (IGM). We make use of the open source package zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters) to disentangle the galactic and IGM components of the Lya profiles to study both the evolution of the intrinsic galactic emission and the IGM transmission across cosmic time. zELDA includes different artificial neural networks that reconstruct IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. These models are trained using mock Lya line profiles. A Monte Carlo radiative transfer code computes the galactic component for the so-called thin shell model. Moreover, the IGM component is included through the IGM transmission curves generated from the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological galaxy formation simulation. We recover their intrinsic galactic spectra by applying the zELDA to 313 Lya line profiles observed with HST/COS and MUSE. Sources at z &lt; 0.5 show weak IGM attenuation, while at z &gt; 3, ZELDA reveals significant IGM suppression of the blue peak in several sources. After separating the IGM effects, the stacked intrinsic galactic Lya profiles show a minimal evolution from z = 0 to 6. The mean IGM transmission for z &lt; 0.5 in HST/COS data exceeds 90%, while the MUSE data show an evolution from 0.85 at z = 3.0 to 0.55 at z = 5.0.</description>

Abstract: Together with gas, stars, and supermassive black holes, dust is crucial in stellar and galaxy evolution. Hence, understanding galaxies' dust properties across cosmic time is critical to studying their evolution. In addition to photometric constraints on the absorption of blue light and its reemission at infrared wavelengths, dust grain properties can be explored spectroscopically via polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands in the mid-IR. The new SPHEREx space telescope conducts an all-sky spectrophotometric survey of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75-5$\,\mu$m, making it ideal for studying the widespread presence of the 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH emission across galaxy populations out to z ~ 0.4. In this paper, we simulated galaxy spectra to investigate SPHEREx's capability to study PAH emission in such galaxies. We find that for the all-sky survey the PAH 3.3$\,\mu$m emission band flux can be measured to 30% accuracy at $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot})&gt;9.5$ and star formation rate (SFR) $&gt; 1\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.1$, $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot}) &gt; 10.5$ and ${\rm SFR} &gt; 10\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.2-0.3$, and $\log(\rm M/{\rm M_\odot})&gt;11$ and ${\rm SFR} &gt; 100\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0.4$. For deep SPHEREx fields, a factor of ~10 deeper sensitivity limits can be reached. Overall, SPHEREx will enable the measurement of the 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH band emission in several hundred thousand galaxies across the sky, providing a population study of the smallest dust grains ("nano grains") and radiation properties in massive galaxies in the nearby Universe.</description>

      <title>SCUBADive II: Searching for $z&gt;4$ Dust-Obscured Galaxies via F150W-Dropouts in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09703</link>

Abstract: The relative fraction of obscured galaxies at $z&gt;4$ compared to lower redshifts remains highly uncertain as accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the JWST counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies in COSMOS-Web, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 ``dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by JWST observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with $z_{\rm phot}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find more candidate high redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to fainter F444W magnitudes ($&gt;24$\,mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates ($\langle$SFR$\rangle=450^{+920}_{-320}$\,\mdot\,yr$^{-1}$) and large stellar masses ($\langle$log$_{10}$(\mstar)$\rangle=11.2^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$\,\mdot) on average, these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which would be missed by pre-JWST optical imaging campaigns, comprise $\gtrsim20$\% of galaxies across mass bins and potentially contribute up to 60\% at the very high mass end (log$_{10}$(\mstar/\mdot)$&gt;11.5$) of the $z&gt;4$ stellar mass function.</description>

      <title>Local dark matter density from Gaia DR3 K-dwarfs using Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local dark matter density provides constraints on dark matter models and is of importance for experiments hoping to detect dark matter particles in the laboratory. The advent of extensive survey data calls for more complex physical modelling and more sophisticated statistical analysis, particularly to account for correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we perform a vertical Jeans analysis, including a local approximation of the tilt term, using a sample of $200\,000$ K-dwarf stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. After combination with the Survey-of-Surveys (SoS) catalogue, $160\,888$ of those have radial velocity measurements. We use Gaussian processes as priors for the covariance matrix of radial and vertical velocities. Joint inference of the posterior distribution of the local dark matter density and the velocity moments is performed using geometric variational inference. We find a local dark matter density of ${\rho_\mathrm{dm} = 0.0117 \pm 0.0035\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.44 \pm 0.13\, \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}$ at the Sun's position, which is in agreement with most other recent analyses. By comparing a ($z$-dependent) Gaussian process prior with a ($z$-independent) scalar prior for the tilt term, we quantify its impact on estimates of the local dark matter density and argue that careful modelling is required to mitigate systematic biases.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic fields in ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies in the circumgalactic medium around massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in galaxies and their haloes could have important consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised circumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive galaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy haloes ($M_{\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$ M$_\odot$), each simulated with and without magnetic fields. Across our full sample of satellite galaxies (11 with magnetic fields and 10 without), we find that the fraction of gas retained after infall through the CGM shows no population-wide impact of magnetic fields. However, for the most massive satellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields. The evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic fields reduce turbulent mixing, inhibiting the dispersion of metals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation from the CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field structure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in the stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in CGM condensation are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail suppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in the CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the structure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic fields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes and should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>CLASSY XII: Nitrogen Enrichment Shaped by Gas Density and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O for a fixed metallicity. We identify a significant correlation between electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v$_{out}$ &gt; 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Discovery of RaJav, a bright spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ Nebula at z=2.25</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a massive and potentially largest Ly$\alpha$ Nebula, RaJav, at z=2.25, associated with a quasar pair: the bright SDSS~J162029.07+433451.1 (hereafter J1620+4334) and the faint newly discovered quasar JPAS-9600-10844, at 2.265 $\pm$ 0.021 using the early data release (17 deg$^{2}$) of the J-PAS. The quasar JPAS-9600-10844 embedded in the nebula is located at ~ 60.2 kpc (7.3'') from J1620+4334, and shows a compact structure with broad emission lines (&gt; 3000 km/s), typical of active galactic nuclei. At a 2$\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) contour of $\sim 1.86 \times 10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, the nebula extends &gt; 100 kpcs and has a total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\sim 5.8 \pm 0.7 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ signify the presence of a giant Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELAN). The nebula traces an over density of quasars at redshift of 2.2-2.3 consistent with the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The extended CIV emission indicates that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) is metal-enriched and not primordial. The current J-PAS observations suggest photoionization and shocks due to outflows as possible ionization mechanisms. The faint extended FUV and NUV continuum emission likely points to ongoing star formation around the two quasars, suggesting a complex interaction in their environments. These findings provide new insights into the environment of quasars and their role in shaping the dynamics and evolution of the CGM at cosmic noon. Further spectroscopic observations will be required to fully characterize the object's nature and its kinematic properties. This study demonstrates the unique capability of J-PAS to detect massive and rare Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, providing new insights into their properties, environments, and connections to large-scale structures in the cosmic web such as filaments and overdensities in a large cosmological volume.</description>

      <title>A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>Map-level baryonification: unified treatment of weak lensing two-point and higher-order statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision cosmology benefits from extracting maximal information from cosmic structures, motivating the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) at small spatial scales. However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model (BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\ell &lt; 2000$ and tomographic bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \lesssim 2$), using the FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted, simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information on small spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning inference of stellar properties using integrated photometric and spectroscopic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar astrophysics relies on diverse observational modalities-primarily photometric light curves and spectroscopic data from which fundamental stellar properties are inferred. While machine learning (ML) has advanced analysis within individual modalities, the complementary information encoded across modalities remains largely underexploited. We present DESA (Dual Embedding model for Stellar Astrophysics), a novel multi-modal foundation model that integrates light curves and spectra to learn a unified, physically meaningful latent space for stars. DESA first trains separate modality-specific encoders using a hybrid supervised/self-supervised scheme, and then aligns them through DualFormer, a Transformer-based cross-modal integration module tailored for astrophysical data. DualFormer combines cross- and self-attention, a novel dual-projection alignment loss, and a projection-space eigendecomposition that yields physically structured embeddings. We demonstrate that DESA significantly outperforms leading unimodal and self-supervised baselines across a range of tasks. In zero- and few-shot settings, DESA's learned representations recover stellar color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with high fidelity ($R^2 = 0.92$ for photometric regressions). In full fine-tuning, DESA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for binary star detection (AUC = $0.99$, AP = $1.00$) and stellar age prediction (RMSE = $0.94$ Gyr). As a compelling case, DESA naturally separates synchronized binaries from young stars, two populations with nearly identical light curves, purely from their embedded positions in UMAP space, without requiring external kinematic or luminosity information. DESA thus offers a powerful new framework for multimodal, data-driven stellar population analysis, enabling both accurate prediction and novel discovery.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of nascent planetary nebulae with OH and H$_2$O masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars like the Sun expel their outer layers and form planetary nebulae (PNe) as they evolve into white dwarfs. PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.</description>

      <title>Interpreting deep learning-based stellar mass estimation via causal analysis and mutual information decomposition</title>

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information that is included in addition to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Low- and high-velocity `water fountains': different evolutionary stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: `Water fountains' (WFs) are optically obscured evolved stars, most of them thought to be in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase, characterized by H$_{2}$O maser emission tracing molecular jets. Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis of 30 Contact Binaries in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (2024), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.</description>
