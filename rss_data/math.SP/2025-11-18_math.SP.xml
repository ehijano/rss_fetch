      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for Weil-Petersson random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that a genus $g$ closed hyperbolic surface, sampled at random from the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g}$ with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure, has Laplacian spectral gap at least $\frac{1}{4}-O\left(\frac{1}{g^{c}}\right)$ with probability tending to $1$ as $g\to\infty$. This extends and gives a new proof of a recent result of Anantharaman and Monk proved in the series of works [2,3,5,4,6].
  Our approach adapts the polynomial method for the strong convergence of random matrices, introduced by Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp and van Handel [19], and its generalization to the strong convergence of surface groups by Magee, Puder and van Handel [41], to the Laplacian on Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for quasi-periodic Jacobi block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for discrete quasiperiodic Jacobi $d\times d$ block matrices with Diophantine frequencies. The H\"older exponent is shown to be any $\beta$ such that $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/(2\kappa^d)$, where $\kappa^d$ is the acceleration, i.e., the slope of the sum of the top $d$ Lyapunov exponents in the imaginary direction of the phase. This generalizes the H\"older continuity results in the Schr\"odinger operator setting in \cites{GS2,HS1}, and also strengthens them in that setting by covering more Diophantine frequencies. The proof is built on a new scheme for obtaining a local zero count for finite-volume characteristic polynomials from a global one.</description>

      <title>The magnitude and spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to $L^p$ Hardy and Rellich-type inequalities in Euclidean and non-Euclidean settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified and concise method for establishing L^p Hardy and Rellich inequalities for a broad class of subelliptic operators of divergence type. The approach, based on a fundamental algebraic identity, provides explicit control on maximizing sequences and yields sharp constants in several significant cases. It applies beyond the Euclidean framework, covering the Heisenberg and Carnot group settings, and extends to a variety of subelliptic operators such as the Heisenberg-Greiner and Baouendi-Grushin operators.</description>

      <title>Competition of small targets in planar domains: from Dirichlet to Robin and Steklov boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a bounded planar domain with multiple small targets on a smooth boundary. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these targets for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on the targets. We start from the classical problem of splitting probabilities for perfectly reactive targets with Dirichlet boundary condition and improve some earlier results. We discuss how this approach can be generalized to partially reactive targets characterized by a Robin boundary condition. In particular, we show how partial reactivity reduces the effective size of the target. In addition, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-target limit. Finally, we show how our asymptotic approach can be extended to interior targets in the bulk and to exterior problems where diffusion occurs in an unbounded planar domain outside a compact set. Direct applications of these results to diffusion-controlled reactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices via contour analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $\sigma_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading to the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. In this paper, we develop a novel method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements, compared to classical approaches in the literature (using Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem or Davis-Kahan theorem), in many settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications.</description>
